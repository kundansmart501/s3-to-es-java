This edition presents six papers covering important theoretical and practical aspects of transportation engineering. On behalf of the editorial board, I thank the authors for their hard work and valuable contributions to the journal. I would also like to extend my appreciation to our esteemed reviewers for their invaluable support.\nTransport networks are one of the most important national assets. Economic prosperity, rapid urbanisation, increasing traffic and ageing infrastructures all have immense impact on safe and efficient operation of this vital asset. Some of these factors are addressed in this issue.\nThe first paper ( Appiah et al., 2016 ) deals with truck characteristics in traffic micro-simulation. The authors present an approach to incorporating the operating characteristics of a local truck fleet in the calibration of micro-simulation models. This approach is different from conventional model calibration where focus is given to adjusting the parameters of driving behaviour logic. The second paper ( Mohapatra et al., 2016 ) reports the influence of conflicting traffic on U-turns at uncontrolled median openings under mixed traffic conditions in an Indian context. With rapid urbanisation and increased traffic volume, most urban roads in India are constructed as multi-lane roads, while many existing two-lane roads are also being widened to multi-lane roads. These multi-lane roads are generally constructed with a raised median, in order to segregate the opposing traffic movements. The authors showed that the impact of conflicting traffic is greater on four-lane roads compared to six-lane roads. In the third paper ( Zong et al., 2016 ), the authors present a model for investigating the feasibility of an integrated transportation demand management (TDM) programme in the Nanhai district of China to mitigate the traffic congestion and reduce exhaust gas emission from motor vehicles. The TDM programme includes a bus priority policy, a motorcycle restriction policy and a congestion pricing policy. The authors demonstrate that all three policies would have a positive effect on Nanhai's transport system. All three papers address key transport issues which traffic engineers and researchers will find very useful.\nIn recent years, railway industries have faced a massive demand for increasing train speeds. However, switch and turnout parts of the track are two critical parts where speed reduction is necessary. In order to develop a more efficient system, the fourth paper ( Sadeghi et al., 2016 ) presents a mathematical model of the impact of railway geometry on the safety of train running and permissible speed. The model is based on the railway vehicle and track parameters such as curve radius, switch initial angle and track gauge with running speed. The model accuracy is verified in field trials. This paper is a good example of how theoretical modelling could help to solve practical issues.\nThe fifth and sixth papers address concrete pavement rehabilitation. The fifth paper ( Lu and Rong, 2016 ), presents the impact of gradation on rubblised Portland cement concrete pavement. Rubblisation is a popular technique for upgrading severely deteriorated concrete pavement. Many previous studies have shown that rubblised concrete with a hot-mix asphalt (HMA) overlay improves pavement performance, especially its cracking resistance. The authors present two studies and demonstrate that if the rubblised gradation matches the requirement for the crushed stone base of the flexible pavement, tensile strains at the HMA overlay bottom develop at a slower pace, indicating an improvement in deterioration resistance (namely cracking) of the overlay system. This article should be a good resource for practitioners and researchers alike. The final paper ( Gao, 2016 ), presents a mathematical model for evaluating the impact of top-down surface cracking in concrete pavement. Surface cracks of concrete pavement not only impact safety and ride quality, but also reduce service life. The author shows that crack length and load position significantly influence the stress intensity factors, and that stress intensity factors are less affected by the elastic modulus of the pavement material than might be expected. Observing that studies on the mechanism of crack propagation in a cement concrete pavement are rather limited, this paper should serve to enhance current knowledge in this field.\nWe trust you find these papers useful and rewarding to read. Comments on this issue or on general journal-related matters will be received with great interest.\nReferences\n""","0.6255053","""https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/10.1680/jtran.2016.169.4.185""","[-0.472855,51.532848]"

In the case of biofuels, the biofuel must achieve greenhouse gas savings of 35% relative to the fossil fuel replaced. For biofuels, greenhouse gas savings can be calculated using life cycle analysis or the European Union default values. In contrast, all electricity used in transport is considered to be the same, regardless of the source or the type of electric vehicle. However, the choice of the electric vehicle and electricity source will have a major impact on the greenhouse gas saving. In this paper the initial findings of a well-to-wheel analysis of electric vehicle deployment in Northern Ireland are presented. The key finding indicates that electric vehicles require least amount of energy per mile on a well-to-wheel basis, consume the fewest resources, even accommodating inefficient fuel production, in comparison to standard internal combustion engine and hybrid vehicles.\nLinks\n""","9.041329","""http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/a-welltowheel-analysis-of-electric-vehicles-in-the-allisland-single-electricity-market(62e06483-1099-4ce6-954d-b45235a925a8).html""","[-5.934759,54.583863]"

However, accident statistics show age and gender differences in the likelihood of adult pedestrian accidents. This study extends earlier work by examining the relative importance of the model components as predictors of intention to cross for four different adult age groups, men, women, drivers and nondrivers. The groups did not differ in the extent to which they differentiated between two situations of varying perceived risk. The model fit was good, but accounted for less of the variance in intention for the youngest group (17-24) than for other age groups. Differences between the age groups in intention to cross seemed to be due to differences in perceived value of crossing rather than differences in perceived risk. Women were less likely to intend to cross than men and perceived more risk, and there were important age, gender and driver status differences in the importance of the TPB variables as predictors of intention. A key implication of these findings is that road safety interventions need to be designed differently for different groups. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

As to geospatial information, they should be able to avail themselves of Member States' networks of services for geospatial data sets and services (discovery, viewing, downloading) via the Internet. On the other hand, linkage of health data of biobank participants to environmental data, using geospatial data, is limited, as it must satisfy the provisions of the EU Directive on the Protection of Personal Data, pursuant to which geospatial data regarding biobank participants are likely to qualify as personal data. Hence, we submit that the consents of biobank participants be reviewed to assess whether they cover the generation and linkage of geospatial data. We also submit that biobanks must have measures in place to prevent the re-identification of participants by use of their geospatial data. We present a model Geographic-Information-Systems (GIS) Toolkit, as an example of what measures could be taken to that effect.\nIntroduction\nBiobank Standardisation and Harmonisation for Research Excellence in the European Union (BioSHaRE-EU) is a consortium of population-based cohort studies and biobanks, with international researchers from diverse domains of biobanking science, including epidemiologists, statisticians, software developers, and experts on ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI). It aims at facilitating data harmonization and standardization, data sharing and pooling across multiple population-based biobanks ( www.BioSHaRE-EU.eu ). BioSHaRE-EU's WorkPackage 7 (WP7) focused on the effects of environmental exposures on health. New methods and approaches that take advantage of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other techniques to assign exposure information to individuals in a standardized and comparable way were considered urgently needed to enrich the collection of phenotypic information in a population-based biobank and to add value to existing biobanking efforts.\nHence, a key objective of WP7 was the development of a GIS-based Toolkit, specifically for use with data collected as a part of cohort studies (see Supplementary Materials ; Supplementary Materials can be found online at www.liebertpub.com/bio ). 1 This toolkit was designed to derive estimates of environmental exposures at the individual or residential address level of population-based cohort participants. In working toward the BioSHaRE-EU-GIS Toolkit, WP7 envisaged the following steps:\nStep 1: The GIS environment and health toolkit will include the capacity to estimate exposures to a number of key environmental variables in a standardized way, which can then be applied to enhance the phenotype of individual cohort participants in biobanking studies.\nStep 2: These variables include: air pollution from traffic-related sources or industrial point sources (e.g., incinerators, power stations, etc.); electromagnetic fields (EMFs) from mobile phone masts, power lines, and/or TV transmitters; and noise pollution from transport (e.g., air, road, rail).\nStep 3: Cohorts/biobanks will be able to use their own source data (e.g., road network, mobile phone masts, etc.) to use the standardized methods. Where possible, existing freeware or open source software (e.g., AERMOD, US EPA dispersion model) will be implemented in the toolkit.\nStep 4: The addresses and postcodes of the cohort participants will be geo-referenced (e.g., to the European standard or the national coordinate system, as appropriate for the cohort under investigation) and integrated into the toolkit as point data.\nStep 5: Exposures will then be estimated by using the toolkit, and estimated at either a specific point location (e.g., EMFs estimated as cohort member address) or as a continuous surface (e.g., air pollution). For the latter, GIS overlay techniques, such as intersect and extract values to points, will be used to assign exposure estimates to participants.\nStep 6: With environmental exposures provided at the level of each cohort member, they can then be linked to other individual-level data and biobank samples for further epidemiological analysis.\nAs part of the ELSI work of WP7, we reviewed what legal issues were triggered by the development and use of the GIS Toolkit. The first issue, obviously, was that a population biobank must be able and permitted to procure environmental data (Steps 1 and 2). The second issue stemmed from the requirement that for a GIS Toolkit to be built, a population biobank would need access to geospatial data to enable the geo-referencing of the addresses and postcodes of the cohort participants (e.g., to the European standard or the national coordinate system, as appropriate for the cohort access [Steps 3 and 4]). Third, exposures had to be estimated by using the toolkit and the exposures provided at the level of each cohort member, so they can be linked to his or her other individual-level data and biobank samples for analysis (Steps 5 and 6).\nAs to procurement of environmental data (Steps 1 and 2), it turned out that the EU law actually mandates that environmental information be readily available for the public, at street level, on the web, from a host of public sources. As to access to geospatial data (Steps 3 and 4), the EU Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) Directive provides that Member States shall establish and operate a network of services for spatial data sets and services, which services shall be available to the public and accessible via the Internet. However, as linking exposure data to other individual-level data (Steps 5 and 6) potentially involves the processing of personal data, this part of the process is restricted by EU Data Protection laws.\nGiven the European nature of the BioSHaRE-EU consortium, the legal analysis was limited to Directives of the European Union (EU), Opinions of the EU Data Protection Article 29 Working Party, and, for reasons of available expertise, the case law of the Dutch Data Protection Agency. Obviously, a full legal assessment of all pertinent issues would require additional analysis of national laws and biobank consent forms. Although the problem about access to public data, potential identification, and data linkage from various sources deals with all data, not only environmental, our focus was on environmental data, as the key objective of our work was to develop a toolkit to help enrich the nature and nurture data typically contained in a population-based cohort or biobank with environmental exposure data. The outcome of the assessment of the EU legal aspects of procuring environmental data, accessing geospatial data, and protecting any resultant personal data informed our design of the BioSHaRE-EU-GIS Toolkit, which is presented here as well.\nDiscussion\nProcuring exposure data: the right to access environmental information\nTo access and obtain environmental data for use in the GIS Toolkit, biobanks and cohorts could avail themselves of their rights under the EU Directive on Public Access to Environmental Information (AEI Directive). 2 The AEI Directive was adopted by the EU to give effect to the Access to Information pillar of the 1998 UNECE (United Nations) Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (the Aarhus Convention). Its provisions are designed to align legislation in EU Member States with the Convention. 3 The objectives of this Directive are to guarantee the public's right of access to environmental information held by or for public authorities and to ensure that environmental information is progressively made available and disseminated to the public to achieve the widest possible systematic availability and dissemination thereof. 4\nIn the AEI Directive, “Environmental information” has been defined broadly, to include a variety of types of data, including, for instance, “(a) the state of the elements of the environment, such as air and atmosphere, water, soil, land, landscape and natural sites including wetlands, coastal and marine areas, biological diversity and its components, including genetically modified organisms, and the interaction among these elements; (b) factors, such as substances, energy, noise, radiation or waste, including radioactive waste, emissions, discharges and other releases into the environment, affecting or likely to affect the elements of the environment referred to in (a); […] and (f) the state of human health and safety, including the contamination of the food chain, where relevant, conditions of human life, cultural sites and built structures (.).” 5 This broad definition was found to be interpreted equally broadly by the Court of Justice of the EU. 6\nUnder the Directive, public authorities must organize the environmental information held by or for them, with a view to its active and systematic dissemination to the public, in particular by means of computer telecommunication and/or electronic technology, where available. 7 They must keep the information up to date and accurate. 8 “Public authority” has been defined as either a government or other public administration, including public advisory bodies, at national, regional, or local levels; any natural or legal person performing public administrative functions under national law, including specific duties, activities, or services in relation to the environment; or any natural or legal person having public responsibilities or functions, or providing public services, related to the environment. As a sidenote, this definition brings up the issue of whether a population-based cohort itself qualifies as a “public authority” and would, therefore, fall under the obligations of the Directive. It follows, however, from the definition of “public authority,” that population-based cohort studies set up by universities and academic institutions for research purposes, do not qualify as “public authority,” as they typically have not been bestowed with public or administrative power and do not provide public or administrative services. In addition, they typically have not been created on the basis of a statute or other legislative instrument and they typically lack funding from the exchequer. For similar reasons, cohorts that are maintained by public health authorities are also unlikely to qualify as “public authority”; they too are typically set up for research purposes and typically do not perform a public or an administrative function. The fact that research using the data from such a cohort could help inform public policy by public health authorities does not render the cohort itself a public authority, although this may be different in various EU member states according to their national definition of “public authority.” As to hospitals that have their collections of medical data and samples converted into a “biobank,” these biobanks are unlikely to qualify as public authority as well, for the reasons cited earlier; a hospital itself is usually not considered as having public or administrative power, even though it may be considered in some jurisdictions as performing public services.\nPursuant to the Directive, public authorities in the EU member states must make available environmental information held by or for them, to any applicant at his or her request and without him or her having to state the objective of his or her application. The term “Applicant” is defined as any natural or legal person requesting environmental information. It follows that the applicant could include biobanks, cohorts, and biobank researchers. It also follows that biobanks do not have to submit a protocol when requesting access. The Directive further prescribes that environmental information shall be made available to an applicant as soon as possible or, at the latest, within 2 months after the receipt by the public authority of the applicant's request. Access to any public registers and examination in situ of the information requested shall be free of charge; public authorities may make a reasonable charge for supplying any environmental information.\nIn addition, to help the public exercise their right of access to environmental information, EU Member States must ensure that officials be required to support the public in seeking such access, that information officers be designated, that facilities for the examination of the information requested be established and maintained, and that registers with environmental information be held by public authorities, with clear indications of where such information can be found. 9\nOf particular relevance to the BioSHaRE-EU-GIS Toolkit is that upon request, and for certain kinds of environmental information (e.g. energy, noise, radiation or waste, including radioactive waste, emissions, discharges, and other releases into the environment), public authorities must report on the place where the information can be found. 10 The public authority must also indicate the measurement procedures, including methods of analysis, sampling, and pre-treatment of samples, used in compiling the information, or refer to a standardized procedure used, where requested. 10 This type of metadata about the provenance of the information could significantly help make scientific analysis by population biobanks and their researchers of these data more robust.\nRequests for access to environmental information may only be refused by the public authorities on a limited, exhaustive number of explicitly listed grounds, which are to be interpreted restrictively. 11 One noteworthy ground for refusal is when disclosure of the information would adversely affect the confidentiality of personal data and/or files related to a natural person where that person has not consented to the disclosure of the information to the public, and where such confidentiality is provided for by national or Community law. 12 However, there exists an exception to this principle whereby the confidentiality of this information may not be invoked as a ground for refusal in cases where the request relates to information on emissions into the environment (the “emissions rule”). 13 The emissions rule creates a legal presumption by which the public interest served by the disclosure prevails over the confidentiality of such information, in the case of information related to emissions into the environment. 6\nAccessing geospatial data: the right to access the spatial data infrastructure\nTo link their existing data to environmental data by using the GIS Toolkit, biobanks could avail themselves of the EU Directive establishing an INSPIRE. 14\nThe INSPIRE directive aims at creating an EU spatial data infrastructure, to enable the sharing of spatial information among public sector organizations and to facilitate public access to spatial information across Europe. The primary aim of the INSPIRE Directive is to solve problems related to EU and Member States cross-border environmental policies due to the (lack of) availability, quality, organization, accessibility, and sharing of spatial information. 15 It aims at solving these problems by implementing measures that address the exchange, sharing, access, and use of interoperable spatial data and spatial data services across the various levels of public authority and across different sectors. To that end, the Directive establishes an infrastructure to enable the sharing of spatial information in the European Community. Also, it sets out provisions to ensure that spatial information infrastructures in the Member States be designed to ensure spatial data from different sources across the Community be combined in a consistent way and shared between several users and applications. 16\nThe Directive requires that Member States establish and operate a network of services for the spatial data sets and services for which metadata have been created. It then provides that those services be made available to the public and accessible via the Internet or by any other appropriate means of telecommunication. More specifically, the Directive applies to inter alia discovery services, making it possible to search for spatial data sets and services on the basis of the content of the corresponding metadata and to display the content of the metadata, view services, making it possible, as a minimum, to display, navigate, zoom in/out, pan, or overlay viewable spatial data sets and to display legend information and any relevant content of metadata, download services and transformation services, enabling spatial data sets to be transformed with a view to achieving interoperability. 17\nThe Directive allows the Member States to limit public access to spatial data sets and services where such access would adversely affect any of a number of specific interests, such as public security, national defense, intellectual property rights, or, notably and of relevance to the linking of exposure data to biobank data using GIS, the confidentiality of personal data, where the person whom the data relates to has not consented to the disclosure of the information to the public. 18 However, the grounds for limiting access are interpreted in a restrictive way and Member States may not limit access to information on emissions into the environment, in line with as the “emissions rule” discussed earlier. According to the INSPIRE directive, Member States must also ensure that the services for access to spatial data are available to the public free of charge, subject to certain exceptions.\nProtecting exposure data as personal data\nHaving identified EU legislation governing the collection of environmental and geospatial data (Steps 2 and 4 of the GIS Toolkit), the question remaining is whether the actual processing and linking of the exposure data (Steps 5 and 6) somehow or at some stage involve the processing of personal data and hence are subject to data protection laws. The BioSHaRE-EU-GIS Toolkit proposes to geocode the addresses and postcodes of cohort participants and to integrate this information into the toolkit as point data. Geocoding, also known as address matching, is the process of assigning geographical coordinates (e.g., latitude and longitude) to geographical location data, such as home addresses of individuals. These geographical coordinates can then be used to assign an exposure to that particular location or to individuals residing or working at that location. 19 This proposed methodology raises the question of whether it qualifies as the processing of personal data and whether the resultant geographical coordinates are to be considered “personal data,” as defined in the EU Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC). 20\nThe Directive defines personal data as any information related to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors that are specific to his or her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity. 21 Recital 26 of the Directive provides that “whereas to determine whether a person is identifiable account should be taken of all the means likely reasonably to be used either by the controller or by any other person to identify the said person.” The term “personal data” has been interpreted by the EU's Article 29 Working Party, 22 which generally summarizes that the Directive contains a broad notion of personal data, and that the objective of the rules contained in the Directive is to protect individuals. 23 Therefore, flexibility is embedded in the text to provide an appropriate legal response to the circumstances at stake. 24\nFurthermore, even data that do not concern a specific person can, nevertheless in some cases reveal information about a specific person; for instance, telephone numbers, license plates, and, notably, postal codes with house numbers are examples of such. 25 In this line, the geocoding of addresses and zip codes can be interpreted as constituting the processing of personal data, and it is therefore subject to the obligations laid down in the Directive. As to whether the resultant geo-coordinates constitute personal information is less clear and requires some further interpretation. According to the Article 29 Working Party, the concept of personal data covers information available in whatever form, in whatever format (e.g. alphabetical, numerical, graphical, photographical, or acoustic), and in whatever medium. 26 This definition seems sufficiently broad to include information in the form of coordinates, for example, one such as N40°42′46.021\"" W74°0′21.388\"".\nIn its Opinion on geo-location services on smart mobile devices, the Article 29 Working Party indicated that location data, for instance, from smart mobile devices, or from base stations and GPS technology, relate to an identified or identifiable natural person, and, consequently, are subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Directive. 27 In reaching its opinion, the Article 29 Working Party considered that this indirect identifiability also applies to WiFi access points. 24 More specifically, the Media Access Control (MAC) address of a WiFi access point, in combination with its calculated location, is inextricably linked to the location of the owner of the access point and, hence, the data controller should treat all data about WiFi routers as personal data.\nThe Article 29 Working Party further considered that the providers of geo-location-based services can gain an intimate overview of habits and patterns of the owners of devices collecting geo-location data, and they can build extensive user profiles. A behavioral pattern may also include special categories of perhaps more sensitive data, if it were to reveal, for example, visits to hospitals and religious places, presence at political demonstrations, or presence at other specific locations, thus revealing data about, for example, sex life. These profiles can be used to take decisions that significantly affect the owner of the device.\nThe Article 29 Working Party also stressed that, as with other new technologies, a major risk with the use of location data is “function creep,” which is essentially the eventual development of new uses for the data, which were not anticipated at the time of the original collection. 28 Much of this rationale also applies to the linking of environmental exposure data to the data of individual biobank participants. Although not intended, such proposed linkage may also likely enable the detailed profiling of participants. Indeed, some linkages could include historical (past residential) address data of participants, enabling “lifetime epidemiology” with the help of GIS. Furthermore, the fact that such profiling would occur in the context of not-for-profit (academic) research rather than in a commercial context (for example, through the use of smart mobile devices) does not matter, as the EU definition of personal data does not distinguish between the (alleged) purposes for the use of data.\nCase law of Dutch Data Protection Agency\nThe Dutch Data Protection Agency (DPA) has provided interesting analyses of the question of whether geo-information can constitute personal data.\nIn the case regarding Google Street View, the DPA rejected the argument made by Google that the possibility to locate a Wifi router in a building does not entail the identification of the holder, as more than one person could use the router. 29 The DPA reasoned that in most cases, the location of the Wifi router can be determined at house door level. Subsequently, the holder of the Wifi router could be identified by using public registries, such as the land registry or the phonebook. It is true that in some cases the Wifi router can be shared by multiple people, but in other cases it is used by only one person. Moreover, cumulative use of a Wifi router does not mean that there is no longer identifiability. Phone numbers, license plates, and zip codes with house numbers, in which case it is also true that they can be shared by multiple people, also qualify as personal data. The mere fact that a category of data is not always traceable to one person does not prevent this category, in general, from being qualified as personal data. The DPA further reasoned that neither the lack of intent to identify nor the costs of identification were relevant, as the conclusion was that Google could establish location and, subsequently, identification without disproportionate effort, which is the legal test. Finally, referring to the Article 29 Working Party Opinion on Geolocation Services regarding smart phones, the DPA stressed that it is the combination of data that collectively qualifies as personal data: originally object data coupled with other data, resulting in personal data. In view of this case law, the geo-referencing of addresses and postcodes of the cohort participants that is a part of the GIS Toolkit (Steps 4 and 5) is likely to qualify as the processing of personal data (even if done on a no-names basis).\nOur qualification (“likely”) stems from the fact that there is a difference and a challenge in geo-location data in relation to urban and rural areas, since location information by street in Manhattan is very different from that in rural areas. Indeed, environmental exposures, within an urban environment, vary greatly due to the density and mix of sources. In rural areas, however, sources are sparser and thus exposures are more constant. The challenge, therefore, is to optimize the geo-location data within urban areas, as this is where the variation in environmental exposures is the greatest. This optimization could also take into account that not all studies need location information down to the second (latitude, longitude) or meters. The spatial resolution that is ideally needed depends on the exposure being studied: Some pollutants reduce rapidly as you move away from the source, for example, some road traffic–related air pollutants, EMFs; some are more similar over larger areas, for example, aircraft noise. It also depends on what spatial scale can be obtained in population health data (e.g., area-level census data versus address-level cohort data). One avenue then, to avoid the application of the Data Protection Directive, would be to lower the resolution rate in the exposure study concerned. Whether this result (the used geo-data no longer qualify as personal data) could be achieved must be established on a study-by-study basis.\nTo the extent that the EU Data Protection Directive applies, measures to protect privacy must be taken. These are built into the GIS Toolkit, as described next.\nThe BioSHaRE-EU-GIS Toolkit: linking address data to environmental data\nTaking the earlier considerations of the legal aspects into account, the Integrated BioSHaRE-EU-GIS Toolkit was delivered (see Supplementary materials ; Supplementary materials are available online at www.liebertpub.com/bio ). The kit gives a comprehensive overview of several procedures and methods that can be used to assist the integration and analysis of cohort/biobank data on environmental exposures and human health. Schematically, the Toolkit can be presented as follows ( Fig. 1 ).\nThe biobank's participant's individual address and health data (based on questionnaires and biological samples) are usually held in a secure database. The following steps describe the procedure:\n1. Export addresses and a unique identifier (ID1);\n2. The address will be geocoded—for example, assigned to an x, y co-ordinate;\n3. Environmental exposures will be modeled and assigned to each individual record;\n4. An enriched dataset including x, y coordinates and environmental exposures will be handed back to the cohort/biobank for integration into the secure database based on the unique identifier ID1;\nWith unique identifier (ID2, note that this should be a different identifier than ID1, to ensure non linkage), the environmental exposure and the health data will then be securely transferred to the researcher conducting health analyses. The researcher has health and exposure information but not address information, thus making the dataset non identifiable. 1\nAs to a mediator or an authority that would serve as a mediator and link the information, in the United Kingdom, this process would be subject to usual ethics and governance approvals. For more details, including a method to document the accuracy of the geocoding procedure, please refer to the full description of the BioSHaRE-EU Integrated EU GIS Toolkit. 1\nConclusion\nThis article examines the legal aspects under EU law of linking population biobank data to environmental exposure data of individual biobank participants by using GIS. Our analysis of the pertinent EU legal framework reveals, on the one hand, that EU law actually facilitates the collection of both environmental data and geospatial data. Indeed, under EU law, biobanks and researchers have the right to collect environmental data and access to geospatial data. The EU Directive on Access to Environmental Information mandates that environmental information should be readily available for the public, at street level, on the web, from a host of public sources and does not reveal specific limitations to linking health and GIS data. A similar conclusion is reached in our review of the EU Directive on INSPIRE, which provides that Member States shall establish and operate a network of services for spatial data sets and services, which services (discovery, viewing, downloading) shall be available to the public and accessible via the Internet. Indeed, both Directives even provide that the right to access information on emissions into the environment may override the confidentiality of personal data, even where that person has not consented to the disclosure of the information to the public (the “emissions rule”). On the other hand, however, linkage of health and environmental data, using GIS data, does pose a problem under the EU Directive on the Protection of Personal Data, as the geographic coordinates resulting from geocoding zip codes and street addresses of biobank participants are likely to qualify as personal data. One avenue to avoid the application of the Data Protection Directive would be to lower the resolution rate in the exposure study concerned. Whether this result (the used geo-data no longer qualify as personal data) could be achieved must be established on a study-by-study basis. To the extent that the EU Data Protection Directive does apply, the processing of biobank-geo data would typically require participants' consent. In addition, measures must be in place to protect their privacy. We present a model GIS Toolkit that incorporates such measures.\nAcknowledgments\nThe research leading to these results was supported by the Biobank Standardisation and Harmonisation for Research Excellence in the European Union (BioSHaRE-EU) program that received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007–2013) under grant agreement No. 261433.\nAuthor Disclosure Statement\nNo conflicting financial interests exist.\nReferences\n""","0.14674821","""http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/bio.2016.0007""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

The original unit commitment problem aims to minimize the fossil fuel cost by determining the on/off status of power units and power contribution of each online unit at the same time. However, the uncoordinated large charging power necessity of plug-in electric vehicles brings unprecedented challenges to the power system operators and further complicates the unit commitment problem. To seamless integrate the plug-in electric vehicles into the unit commitment, a new binary/real-value hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm framework is proposed in this paper, simultaneously determining the binary status and power output of units as well as the power delivered to/feedback from flexible charging and discharging of plug-in electric vehicles. A batch of binary particle swarm optimisation variants with different transfer functions are implemented and compared in solving the unit commitment problem with and without plug-in electric vehicles. Numerical studies illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent algorithm and the impact of different transfer functions is evaluated.\nDocuments\nA Hybrid Meta-heuristic Method for Unit Commitment Considering Flexible Charging and Discharging of Plug-in Electric Vehicles\nRights statement: Copyright 2016 IEEE.

It was hypothesized that moving pedestrians would be detected at greater distances when wearing retroreflective aids in biological motion configuration (‘biomotion’ clothing), but not when wearing a standard retroreflective vest. Participants viewed films of the journey, pressed a button when they detected the pedestrian and rated the difficulty of the task. Biomotion clothing did not significantly increase detection distance for either moving or stationary pedestrians compared to the vest. However, moving pedestrians were detected significantly further away than stationary pedestrians with both clothings.

Research into this area is generally classed as vehicle-to-grid research. In theory, the energy available from electric vehicles could be directly correlated to the vehicle's state of charge (SoC) and battery capacity during the time the car is parked and plugged in. However, not all the energy in the vehicle may be used, as some capacity is required by the driver for their next journey. As such, this paper uses data captured as part of a large scale electric vehicle trial to investigate the effect of three different types of driver routine on vehicle-to-grid availability. Each driver's behaviour is analysed to assess the energy that is available for STOR, with follow on journey requirements also considered.\nDocuments\nImpact of driver behaviour on availability of electric vehicle stored energy for STOR\nRights statement: © 2014 IEEE.

PhD thesis, University of Liverpool.\nText\nDownload (6MB)\nAbstract\nFast diminishing fossil fuel resources, deterioration in air quality and concerns for environmental protection, continuously promote the interest in the research and development of Alternative Energy Vehicles (AEVs). Traction motor drive is an integral part and common electric propulsion system in all kinds of AEVs. It plays an utmost significant role in the development of electrified transport industry. Application of Induction Motor (IM) drive is not only limited to the domestic and industrial applications but also has an ubiquitous influence in the modern electrified transport sector. IM is characterized by a simple and rugged structure, operational reliability, low maintenance, low cost, ability to operate in a hostile environment and high dynamic performance. However, IM is one of the widely accepted choices by Electric Vehicles (EVs) manufacturer. At present, Variable speed IM drive is almost replacing the traditional DC motor drive in a wide range of applications including EVs where a fast dynamic response is required. It became possible after the technological advancement and development in the field of power switching devices, digital signal processing and recently intelligent control systems have led to great improvements in the dynamic performance of traction drives. Speed Sensorless control strategies offer better system’s reliability and robustness and reduce the drive cost, size and maintenance requirements. Sensorless IM drives have been applied on medium and high speed applications successfully. However, instability at low speed and under different load disturbance conditions are still a critical problem in this research field and has not been robustly achieved. Some application such as traction drives and cranes are required to maintain the desired level of torque down to low speed levels with uncertain load torque disturbance conditions. Speed and torque control is more important particularly in motor-in-wheel traction drive train configuration EVs where vehicle wheel rim is directly connected to the motor shaft to control the speed and torque. The main purpose of this research is to improve the dynamic performance of conventional proportional-integral controller based model reference adaptive system (PI-MRAS) speed observer by using several speed profiles under different load torque disturbance conditions, which is uncertain during the whole vehicle operation apart from the vehicle own load. Since, vehicle has to face different road conditions and aerodynamic effects which continuously change the net load torque effect on the traction drive. This thesis proposes different novel methods based on the fuzzy logic control (FLC) and sliding mode control (SMC) with rotor flux MRAS. Numerous simulations and experimental tests designed with respect to the EV operation are carried out to investigate the speed estimation performance of the proposed schemes and compared with the PI-MRAS speed observer. For simulation and experimental purpose, Matlab-Simulink environment and dSPACE DS-1104 controller board are used respectively. The results presented in this thesis show great performance improvements of the proposed schemes in speed estimation & load disturbance rejection capability and provide a suitable choice of speed sensoless IM drive control for EVs with cost effectiveness.\nItem Type:\n""","12.055106","""https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3008062/""","[-2.96826,53.408471]"

Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems have been installed on many bridges to provide data for the evaluation of bridge performance and safety. The challenge for bridge engineers is now to make use of the data and convert them into usable information and knowledge. Integrating SHM data with reliability analysis procedures offers a useful and practical methodology for bridge assessment since reliability is an important performance index and reliability-based procedures have the capability of accommodating uncertainties in structural models, responses, loads and monitoring data. In this paper, an approach for integrating SHM data in a reliability assessment framework is proposed. The reliability of the bridge is quantified by incorporating SHM information in the resistance, load and structural models. Advanced modeling tools and techniques, such as finite element analysis, finite model updating and Bayesian updating, are used for the reliability computations. Data from the SHM system installed on the Newmarket Viaduct, a newly constructed, 12-span, post-tensioned box girder bridge erected by the balanced cantilever method in Auckland, New Zealand, are also presented in this paper and used to explain the proposed framework.\nInfo:\nW.K.

In this paper, failure procedure and reliability analysis flow chart of stochastic structural system based on stochastic finite element were present. Establishment of the safety margin, reduced member stiffness matrix and opposite sign of the equivalent nodal force was analyzed in the failure process. Stochastic finite element method was adopt to solve the structures’ stochastic, and the reliability of structural system is evaluated by PNET method. According to probabilities of the failure paths redound to probability of failure of the structural system, the most significant failure paths was determined on the basis of the branch-and-bound method. Then, a classical 48-bar space truss problem is made as an example to illustrate the predominance of this algorithm, the calculation shows that the analysis of the failure process is justified; this methodology is efficient and useful for reliability analysis of large stochastic structural system.\n223\nStudy on Parameters for Identification of Wavelet Packet Energy Spectrum for Structural Damage Alarming\nAuthors: Peng Sun, Ai Qun Li, You Liang Ding, Yang Deng\nAbstract: The damage alarming analysis based on wavelet packet energy spectrum is performed with regard to the experimental data of Benchmark steel frame structure and online monitoring data of Runyang Suspension Bridge, on the basis of which the damage alarming effects using various wavelet functions are investigated in detail.

Curvature mode is an ideal method to identify structural damage location, with advantages of easy to be operated and sensitive to local damage, while the frequency is easy to test with high precision. An improved structural damage identification method is presented, which combines curvature and frequency. Finally, the improved method presented herein is verified by a simple support steel beam tested in laboratory. The results show that the improved method can effectively identify structural damage location.\n439\nAbout the Structural Robustness of Through Arch Bridges\nAuthors: Rui Juan Jiang, Qi Ming Wu, Yi Yan Chen, Xiao Wei Yi, Jun Tu\nAbstract: In EN1991-1-7 Eurocode 1: Part 1-7 Accidental Actions structural robustness is defined as ‘the ability of a structure to withstand events like fire, explosions, impact or consequences of human error without being damaged to an extent disproportionate to the original cause’. Accordingly, the principle of structural robustness is that local damage is acceptable, provided that it will not endanger the structure and that the overall load-carrying capacity is maintained during an appropriate length of time to allow the necessary emergency measures to be taken. For different structures the practical ways to achieve robustness are different. Lots of through arch bridges with hangers have been built throughout the world. However, the structural collapse may happen due to the hanger's damage or failure if the bridge is not designed appropriately. In this paper, the structural robustness of the through arch bridges with vertical hangers are discussed and verified by an example. Based on this study, a few practical suggestions are put forward to achieve the structural robustness for the future through arch bridges' design.\n2412\n""","0.28637767","""https://www.scientific.net/KEM.558.39""","[-2.099122,57.165019]"

The ‘Foot-LITE’ project aims to encourage drivers to adopt greener and safer driving practices, with real-time feedback being given in-vehicle (during driving) and retrospective feedback off-line (pre- and post-driving). This article focuses on the early concept development of the Foot-LITE system, for which a Cognitive Work Analysis methodology was adopted. Presented are results from a Work Domain Analysis (WDA) conducted to scope the relevant driving domain and to identify the constraints on the system. Besides establishing a common framework and language for the project, the process will ultimately contribute to the design of the in-vehicle interface. This article also suggests an extension to the WDA framework to include novel methods for assessing the priority of lower level nodes and contributions of these nodes to the high-level objectives of the system.\n""","0.5196666","""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1463922X.2010.539285""",

This securitized landscape invites a definition of the border predicated on a neat dichotomy between one's own identity and a foreign and dangerous “Other.” However even this border is a complex and contradictory boundary, in which residents’ attitudes, beliefs and practices are ambivalent and defy neat categorization. This study provides a more nuanced account of geographical imagination at this border by treating the borderland as a heterotopic space, rather than perceiving the border as a fixed line, and by examining the everyday “micro-political” operations and materialities that inhabitants of the border region perform and experience. While there is clearly a relationship between security and identity at this border, the outcome of this research indicates that this relationship is non-linear and more complex than can be allowed for by a hostile cultural imagination solely based on a self/Other dyad.\nIntroduction\nFor recent theoretical conceptualizations of borders in geography and related disciplines, Israel's northern border with Lebanon is a glaring anachronism. The Blue Line, the armistice line between Israel and Lebanon delineated by the UN in 2000 that acts as a de facto border due to the lack of a permanent border agreement between the two states, remains a heavily militarized and sealed boundary (O'Shea 2004 O'Shea, Brendan. 2004. Lebanon's ‘Blue Line’: A New International Border or Just another Cease-Fire Zone? Studies in Conflict & Terrorism 27, no. 1: 19–30. doi: 10.1080/10576100490262124 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). This confounds critical and post-structuralist geographers’ recent focus on reterritorialization through “smart borders” that use advanced surveillance technologies and human intelligence to selectively include “desirables” while filtering out the dangerous Other as a way of reconciling globalized neo-liberal flows with post 9–11 insecurity (Sparke 2006 Sparke, Matthew B. 2006. A Neoliberal Nexus: Economy, Security and the Biopolitics of Citizenship on the Border. Political Geography 25, no. 2: 151–180. doi: 10.1016/j.polgeo.2005.10.002 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ).\nThis article will address this disjunction between recent theoretical directions and the conditions on the ground at a specific border by examining the small scale “micro-politics” that make up the Israeli side of the border, rather than attempting to analyze both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border from a traditional perspective through top-down terms of regional politics and international relations. In doing so it will attempt to explicate how the identities and geopolitical positions of Israeli border residents are affected by the spatial proximity of the securitized border.\nIn particular, this research will question the notion evinced by some post-structuralist geopolitics and critical security studies that the materialities of security are the function of a binary geographical imagination of identity being constructed in diametric opposition to a threatening or somehow irreconcilably different “Other.” One of the most influential works in this vein is Derek Gregory's polemic The Colonial Present. In this book Gregory ( 2004 Gregory, Derek. 2004. The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine, and Iraq.\nMalden\n,\nMA\n: Blackwell Publishing.  [Google Scholar] ) argues that a colonial “geographical imagination” operates through security discourses to influence the militaristic materialities that enforce occupation. He traces this imagination to Said's Orientalism in which difference is “construct[ed] and calibrat[ed]” (Gregory 2004 Gregory, Derek. 2004. The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine, and Iraq.\nMalden\n,\nMA\n: Blackwell Publishing.  [Google Scholar] , 17) by “designating in one's mind a familiar space which is ‘ours’ and an unfamiliar space beyond ‘ours’ which is ‘theirs'” (Said 1979 Said, Edward. 1979. Orientalism. New York: Vintage Books.  [Google Scholar] , 54). This sense of intractable difference gives rise to a colonialist imperative by “the West” directed at “the East” that is used to justify invasions and atrocities. Gregory's exemplars are the US post-9/11 interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan and Israel's military activity in the West Bank and Gaza.\nYiftachel points out that Gregory's analysis is particularly problematic with respect to Israel due to its “flattening of difference between American and Israeli colonialism(s)” and its “overlooking of the dialectics of violence and deep chasms in Israeli society” (Yiftachel 2008 Yiftachel, Oren. 2008. (Un)Settling Colonial Presents. Political Geography 27, no. 3: 364–370. doi: 10.1016/j.polgeo.2008.01.005 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 365). An integral part of Gregory's argument is that imagined distance has an influence on the actions of the “colonial powers” that supercedes physical distance. In other words, violence becomes acceptable because of the salience of an imagined separation between “the self” and “the Other” despite the physical proximity between soldier and (human) target. In the Israeli case in particular, this ignores the complexity of the close physical proximity of Israelis and the “Arab Other” in shaping the discourses and materialities of security. It also paints Israel as “monolithic,” ignoring the “highly controversial” nature of the nationalist “expansionist ethnicization project” that has “caus[ed] widespread discrimination, dispossession and conflict” deeply dividing mainly secular Israeli leftists from their religious-nationalist right-wing counterparts, and has been the cause of “repeated political crises” (Yiftachel 2008 Yiftachel, Oren. 2008. (Un)Settling Colonial Presents. Political Geography 27, no. 3: 364–370. doi: 10.1016/j.polgeo.2008.01.005 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 367).\nAnother critique of The Colonial Present presented by Ó Tuathail is that it lacks a sophisticated concept of the relationship between “the more formalized geopolitical visions and the high practical geopolitics of statecraft” and the more “mundane … popular geopolitics.” He further suggests that Gregory is unable “to distinguish competing geopolitical discourse within these geopolitical cultures, alternative geopolitical storylines which contest those held by the administration in power” (Ó Tuathail 2008 Ó Tuathail, Gearóid. 2008. Derek Gregory's The Colonial Present (Book Review), Political Geography 27, no. 3, 339–343.  [Google Scholar] , 341–342). This critique corroborates the argument presented in this article that a dualistic Saidian cultural imagination of “us/them” (Ó Tuathail 2008 Ó Tuathail, Gearóid. 2008. Derek Gregory's The Colonial Present (Book Review), Political Geography 27, no. 3, 339–343.  [Google Scholar] , 341) is unable to account for the acute level of nuance and diversity of geopolitical understandings expressed through quotidian “popular geopolitics.” While the “architecture of enmity” that Gregory ( 2004 Gregory, Derek. 2004. The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine, and Iraq.\nMalden\n,\nMA\n: Blackwell Publishing.  [Google Scholar] , 20) describes certainly does exist along the Blue Line in the form of border fences and military installations, this is related to a materialized discourse of security and does not constitute a coherent “geographical imagination,” particularly when culture is given consideration in light of the spatial proximity and cultural “transition zone” of the borderland (Popescu 2012 Popescu, Gabriel. 2012. Bordering and Ordering the Twenty-First Century : Understanding Borders.\nLanham\n,\nMD\n: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. [Kindle Edition]  [Google Scholar] , 16). In other words, the “enmity” produced by elite geopolitical discourses are not uncritically accepted verbatim by the public as Gregory ( 2004 Gregory, Derek. 2004. The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine, and Iraq.\nMalden\n,\nMA\n: Blackwell Publishing.  [Google Scholar] , 141) insinuates. Rather, much like the heterotopic space of the borderland, everyday geopolitical imaginations in border spaces are heterogeneous and ambivalent, often defying the binary terms favored in the Western philosophical tradition that seek to classify space into neatly divided categories (Ahn 2010 Ahn, Ilsup. 2010. Deconstructing the DMZ: Derrida, Levinas and the Phenomenology of Peace. Cooperation and Conflict 45, no. 2: 205–223. doi: 10.1177/0010836710370249 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 206).\nBorders in theory and practice\nRecent post-structuralist border theorists have worked to emphasize the contingency and multiple aspects of borders. In doing so, they see the borders not as a fixed line, but as a mutable process that is constantly reshaped and negotiated through processes of deterritorialization and reterritorialization (e.g. Ó Tuathail 1998 Ó Tuathail, Gearóid. 1998. Political Geography III: Dealing with Deterritorialization. Progress in Human Geography 22, no. 1: 81–93. doi: 10.1191/030913298673827642 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ; Paasi 1998 Paasi, Anssi. 1998. Boundaries as Social Processes: Territoriality in the World of Flows. Geopolitics 3, no. 1: 69–88. doi: 10.1080/14650049808407608 [Taylor & Francis Online]   [Google Scholar] , 1999 Paasi, Anssi. 1999. Boundaries as Social Practice and Discourse: The Finnish–Russian Border. Regional Studies 33, no. 7: 37–41. doi: 10.1080/00343409950078701 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). Based on Deleuzian theory, the concept of deterritorialization suggests that borders rapidly dissolve due to factors such as new interstate configurations including the EU, globalization and network flows, and the collapse or split of nation-states. However, this dissolution is not an ultimate step in a historical teleology. Ó Tuathail argues “that what we are dealing with is not deterritorialization alone but a rearrangement of the identity/border/order complex that gives people, territory, and politics their meaning in the contemporary world.” Put differently, “geography is not so much disappearing as being restructured, rearranged and rewired” (Ó Tuathail 1999 Ó Tuathail, Gearóid. 1999. Borderless Worlds? Problematising Discourses of Deterritorialisation. Geopolitics 4, no. 2. Routledge: 139–154. doi: 10.1080/14650049908407644 [Taylor & Francis Online]   [Google Scholar] , 143, 147).\nThe recent theorization of fluid borders has also been critiqued as partial and naïve since “territorial borders are still used as key strategies to objectify space” (Van Houtum and Naerssen 2002 Van Houtum, Henk, and Ton van Naerssen. 2002. Bordering, Ordering and Othering. Tijdschrift Voor Economische En Sociale Geografie 93, no. 2: 125–136. doi: 10.1111/1467-9663.00189 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 128). Furthermore, the treatment of deterritorialization and reterritorialization as an altogether novel phenomenon concomitant with globalization has been brought into question. Walters writes that borders have “always” existed for the purpose of selectively “filter[ing] … the good and the bad, the useful and the dangerous, the licit and the illicit” in order to produce a “high-trust” interior secured from the wild zones outside (Walters 2006 Walters, W. 2006. Border/Control. European Journal of Social Theory 9, no. 2: 187–203. doi: 10.1177/1368431006063332 [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] , 197).\nIn keeping with the understanding that borders are malleable and ever-changing, Popescu has created a typology that resists limiting the border to a specific location but rather suggests that bordering takes place at multiple scales and locations through “borderlands, networked borders and border lines” (Popescu 2012 Popescu, Gabriel. 2012. Bordering and Ordering the Twenty-First Century : Understanding Borders.\nLanham\n,\nMD\n: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. [Kindle Edition]  [Google Scholar] , 77–78). While this article will draw on all three elements of this border typology, the borderland concept is a particularly useful tool for thinking about the Galilee border region as it spatializes the fixed territorial aspect of bordering processes in addition to the border's permeable qualities. Newman further elaborates on the unique spatial configuration of the borderland:\nThe discussion concerning the nature of borders as bridges and points of interaction (as contrasted to their traditional role of barriers) is of relevance in the sense that borders can become transformed into the frontiers (in the most positive sense of the term) where people or groups who have traditionally kept themselves distant from each other, make the first attempts at contact and interaction, creating a mixture of cultures and hybridity of identities. (Newman 2006 Newman, David. 2006. The Lines That Continue to Separate Us: Borders in Our ‘Borderless’ World. Progress in Human Geography 30, no. 2: 143–161. doi: 10.1191/0309132506ph599xx [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 150).\nThe notion of the borderland as a “frontier” suggests that the physical distance from the core has the productive effect of creating an epistemological distance from dominant discourses and the exercise of state power that can facilitate the dissolution of boundaries that create absolute difference. However, Diener and Hagen counter an overly naive perception of borderlands as sites of hybridity, stating that although “[o]ften portrayed in the positive light of cosmopolitanism, borderland populations can exist at both the physical and social margins of their national society” (Diener and Hagen 2009 Diener, Alexander C., and Joshua Hagen. 2009. Theorizing Borders in a ‘Borderless World’: Globalization, Territory and Identity. Geography Compass 3, no. 3: 1196–1216. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-8198.2009.00230.x [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] , 1207). This article will exploit the tension between the borderland as a site of mixity with the potential to break down barriers, and the contrasting view of the borderland as a marginalized periphery to evoke the complex and contradictory qualities of the ontological processes that occur at the border.\nMegoran suggests that as “an alternative way forward that builds on an understanding of boundaries and borders as social processes in general but that addresses the shortcomings of the bordering and bounding approach … it is productive to think about international boundaries as having biographies” (Megoran 2011 Megoran, Nick. 2011. Rethinking the Study of International Boundaries: A Biography of the Kyrgyzstan–Uzbekistan Boundary. Annals of the Association of American Geographers 102, no. 2: 464–281. doi: 10.1080/00045608.2011.595969 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 467). This approach is a productive way of thinking about the specific historical, geopolitical and ethno-national circumstances that contextualize the border to deconstruct an essentialist and synchronic reading of border landscapes. Megoran, also cautions in his article on the geopolitics of danger in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan “that not all societies operate the same mechanisms of demonization and exclusion, and we must be wary of reinscribing them as inevitable conditions of social formation” (Megoran 2005 Megoran, Nick. 2005. The Critical Geopolitics of Danger in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 23, no. 4: 555–580. doi: 10.1068/d56j [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 575). In keeping with Megoran's methodology, this research will examine how Israel's northern border is re/produced by documenting and explaining some of the practices and knowledges that elucidate Israeli understandings of identity, security and space. This approach has the potential to reveal new knowledge about how borders shape “geographical imaginations” (Gregory 2004 Gregory, Derek. 2004. The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine, and Iraq.\nMalden\n: Blackwell Publishing.  [Google Scholar] ).\nA notable difference between Megoran's research and my own was his sole methodological focus on representation in texts such as newspaper and printed media, while my research combined textual analysis with a study of everyday practices, symbols and materialities. Dittmer and Gray note that one of the main contributions of “critical” geopolitics “has been the recognition of geopolitics as something everyday that occurs outside of academic and policymaking discourse.” However, they admonish critical geopolitics’ “excessive attention to texts” and overemphasis on power relations and the agency of elites in shaping geopolitical discourses (Dittmer and Gray 2010 Dittmer, Jason, and Nicholas Gray. 2010. Popular Geopolitics 2.0: Towards New Methodologies of the Everyday. Geography Compass 4, no. 11: 1664–1677. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-8198.2010.00399.x [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] , 1664–1665). This call to pay attention to “popular geopolitics” effectively critiques the Gramscian notion held by many academics that individuals uncritically consume and internalize “elite” discourses disseminated through media outlets and official propaganda.\nEthnography is an appropriate methodology for getting at “popular geopolitics” as it allows for evidence to be gathered at the everyday level to uncover insights that analysis of grand geopolitical narratives would obfuscate. Müller suggests that the geopolitical discourses typically represented in “critical” geopolitics ignore “the influence of local, regional or institution context” and\nelides the fact that … there is a reciprocal relationship between the national or global level, and the local or organisational level, and … that at these sub-levels the imaginations may be far more fiercely contested than becomes apparent from looking at codified sublimations only (Müller 2009 Müller, Martin. 2009. Making Great Power Identities in Russia: An Ethnographic Discourse Analysis of Education at a Russian Elite University.\nBerlin\n: Lit Verlag.  [Google Scholar] , 12).\nAccording to Müller, ethnography provides a corrective for the totalizing perspective of much geopolitical research because of “its ability to listen to the routine ways in which people make sense of the world in everyday life” (Müller 2009 Müller, Martin. 2009. Making Great Power Identities in Russia: An Ethnographic Discourse Analysis of Education at a Russian Elite University.\nBerlin\n: Lit Verlag.  [Google Scholar] , 74–75). In the specific context of borders, Newman suggests that\none of the challenges of border theorizers is to collect these narratives and to put them together in such a way that the different types of barrier or interaction functions of the border—be they visible in the landscape or not—are understood at this local level of daily life practices (Newman 2006 Newman, David. 2006. The Lines That Continue to Separate Us: Borders in Our ‘Borderless’ World. Progress in Human Geography 30, no. 2: 143–161. doi: 10.1191/0309132506ph599xx [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 153–154).\nDue to the political sensitivity of this research, careful use of informal semi-structured interviews as an ethnographic technique helped to establish a rapport with informants that made them more open to sharing information and opinions. Semi-structured interviews work as “conversation with a purpose” to gain in-depth understandings that dynamically respond to interviewees’ knowledges and subjectivities, and unlike more structured data gathering methods, is sensitive to informants and fosters more balanced power relations based on dialogue rather than interrogation by the researcher (Eyles 1988 Eyles, John. 1988. Interpreting the Geographical World: Qualitative Approaches in Geographical Research. In Qualitative Methods in Human Geography, ed. J. Eyles and D.M. Smith, 1–16.\nCambridge\n: Polity Press.  [Google Scholar] ). While a researcher from a British university is likely to be spatially and emotionally distant from the violence that has periodically erupted along the Israel–Lebanon border, he or she must be empathetic since many of the local informants will have been directly affected by this political violence. Also, a direct line of question might only lead to a superficial recitation of dominant “security” language broadcasted by political elites. While such a stance is certainly likely to be an internalized aspect of an individual's response to geopolitical danger and should not be dismissed out of hand, it might elide the complexity or nuances of a person's views.\nThe analysis of textual representations of the border in Israeli newspaper reports provided some useful perspectives about cultural imaginations of the border, narratives about difference, and the political production of space to supplement the primary ethnographic research. Newspaper accounts also provide detailed description of specific key incidents in detail and in some cases document their aftermath and effects to show how security is relationally produced. In order to critically evaluate the discursive position and bias of journalistic texts, and to demonstrate how the meaning of these texts are produced in dialogue or opposition to other texts and discursive positions (Fowler 1991 Fowler, R. 1991. Language in the News: Discourse and Ideology in the Press.\nAbingdon\n: Routledge.  [Google Scholar] ), I deliberately sampled from a range of English language daily newspapers. These included the left-wing Haaretz, Ynet, the web outlet for the popular centrist Yedioth Ahranoth, and the conservative-leaning Jerusalem Post.\nLiving on the edge: locating the border in Israeli space\nThe Galilee region is a frontier located at the periphery of Israeli space in relation to the core region encompassing the area between Haifa and Jerusalem ( Figure 1 ). The Galilee is highly ethnically mixed with a roughly even population of Jews and ethnic minorities. According to a recent OECD report submitted by Israel “[w]ith 44% Jews, 46% Arab and 8% Druze, the Northern District is the most diverse in Israel.” The remaining 2% is mostly comprised of Circassians and Bedouin (Golub 2009 Golub, John E. 2009. The Galilee, Israel: Self-Evaluation Report. OECD Reviews of Higher Education in Regional and City Development, IMHE. http://www.oecd.org/edu/imhe/reviewofhighereducationinregionalandcitydevelopment2008–10thegalileeisrael.htm .  [Google Scholar] , 14).\nAlterity, Security and Everyday Geopolitics at Israel's Border with Lebanon\nAll authors\nDisplay full size\nFigure 1. Map of the Israel/Lebanon/Syria Border Region Showing the Blue Line and the Northern Half of the Golan Heights. Source: Google Earth.\nFrom a historical perspective, between the 1500s and the First World War, the entire Levant was part of the Ottoman Empire and the distinct national entities endemic to the region at present did not exist. Rather, the territory belonged to Ottoman administrative districts (Fraser 2004 Fraser, T. G. 2004. The Arab-Israeli Conflict. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.  [Google Scholar] , 2). Following the Ottoman’ defeat in the First World War the empire was dismantled and the territory was partitioned by the victors into a British Mandate comprised of Palestine, Trans-Jordan (although the British granted limited political control to the Hashemite Emirate) and Iraq and a French Mandate that included Lebanon and Syria (Gil-Har 2000 Gil-Har, Yitzhak. 2000. Boundaries Delimitation: Palestine and Trans-Jordan. Middle Eastern Studies 36, no. 1: 68–81. doi: 10.1080/00263200008701297 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 70). The border between British and French rule was carved by French and British cartographers, along boundaries agreed during the San Remo Peace Conference in 1920, which were partly based on the earlier secret Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916. Kaufman notes that “as in other places in the Middle East, and for that matter in the colonial world as a whole, it was impossible to create these borders without influencing and disturbing the local population for whom they made little sense” (Kaufman 2006 Kaufman, Asher. 2006. Between Palestine and Lebanon: Seven Shi'i Villages as a Case Study of Boundaries, Identities, and Conflict. Middle East Journal 60, no. 4: 685–706. [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 705). This suggests that the present delineation of nation states in the region is not an intrinsic or inalienable set of cultural categories for residents of the borderlands, notwithstanding the later introduction of more extensive Jewish settlement in the Galilee.\nThe spatial dynamics of the border region were drastically altered following the creation of the State of Israel in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab–Israeli war. The North became an internal frontier that Zionist leaders in the post-1948 period sought to “Judaize” through regional planning policies. According to Kipnis the two main objectives of these policies were to engineer “a demographic balance in favor of Jews” and “the deployment of a continuous network of Jewish settlements along hostile borders and densely populated Arab territories” (Kipnis 1984 Kipnis, Baruch. 1984. Role and Timing of Complementary Objectives of a Regional Policy, the Case of Northern Israel. Geoforum 15, no. 2: 191–200. doi: 10.1016/0016-7185(84)90031-9 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 191). The latter objective indicates the “defensive function” of civilian settlements in the “security landscape” of the Israeli periphery based on their location in areas deemed to be of “present, or future, strategic importance to [the] Jewish state” (Newman 1989 Newman, David. 1989. Civilian and Military Presence as Strategies of Territorial Control: The Arab-Israel Conflict. Political Geography Quarterly 8, no. 3: 215–227. doi: 10.1016/0260-9827(89)90039-6 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 220; Soffer and Minghi 1986 Soffer, Arnon, and Julian V. Minghi. 1986. Israel's Security Landscapes: The Impact of Military Considerations on Land Uses. The Professional Geographer 38, no. 1: 28–41. doi: 10.1111/j.0033-0124.1986.00028.x [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ).\nA specific feature of the Israeli “periphery” in the Galilee is the phenomenon of “Development Towns” (DTs) in which planners strategically deployed “marginal segments” of the Jewish migrant population, first Mizrahi immigrants from North Africa in the 1950s and later Russian Jews, in order to achieve Jewish control of the North. Tzfadia argues that “these policies perpetuate the marginality of the towns and preserve the unequal geographical distribution of power and wealth, as well as reinforce ethnic and class stratification” (Tzfadia 2006 Tzfadia, Erez. 2006. Public Housing as Control: Spatial Policy of Settling Immigrants in Israeli Development Towns. Housing Studies 21, no. 4: 523–537. doi: 10.1080/02673030600709058 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 523). Furthermore, Falah problematizes the “Judiazation” policy in relation to the Galilean Arab minority within the framework of Israeli democracy as they are Israeli citizens “theoretically entitled to equal rights” to Jews, while simultaneously being “perceived as belonging in national terms to the broader Palestinian people, with whom Israeli Jews are locked in struggle over the territory of Palestine” (Falah 1989 Falah, Ghazi. 1989. Israeli ‘Judaization’ Policy in Galilee and Its Impact on Local Arab Urbanization. Political Geography Quarterly 8, no. 3: 229–253. doi: 10.1016/0260-9827(89)90040-2 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 230).\nThe ethnographic component of this research was mostly carried out in and around the development towns of Kiryat Shemona and Maalot-Tarshiha, both located within ten kilometers of the Blue Line. The latter is a particularly interesting site as it is a mostly ethnically segregated but jointly administered conurbation comprised of the Arab town of Tarshiha and the Jewish DT of Maalot, built more recently alongside it (Shmueli and Kipnis 1998 Shmueli, Deborah, and Baruch Kipnis. 1998. Participatory Planning and Ethnic Interaction in Ma'alot–Tarshiha, a Jewish–Arab Community. Applied Geography 18, no. 3: 225–241. doi: 10.1016/S0143-6228(98)00016-2 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 227). Generally, the DTs featured calculated urban planning with communist-style concrete apartment blocks. Until quite recently these towns were viewed as highly undesirable places to live due to poor quality housing, a lack of jobs, and high levels of social deprivation, and to some extent still are due to the higher risk of political violence from across the border. However in the last few years, the stigma attached to the DTs has decreased due to the building of new neighborhoods with large single-family suburban style homes, increased government investment in business and infrastructure, and financial incentives such as subsidies and tax breaks to encourage families to move there (Yiftachel 1997 Yiftachel, Oren. 1997. Nation-Building or Ethnic Fragmentation? Frontier Settlement and Collective Identities in Israel. Space and Polity 1, no. 2: 149–169. doi: 10.1080/13562579708721761 [Taylor & Francis Online]   [Google Scholar] ).\nIn agreement with Gregory's notion of understanding of colonialism as a “cultural process … energized through signs, metaphors and narratives” (Gregory 2004 Gregory, Derek. 2004. The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine, and Iraq.\nMalden\n,\nMA\n: Blackwell Publishing.  [Google Scholar] , 8), Yiftachel defines the frontier in which the northern development towns are located as “the geographical, political or cultural margins of the collective” (Yiftachel 1997 Yiftachel, Oren. 1997. Nation-Building or Ethnic Fragmentation? Frontier Settlement and Collective Identities in Israel. Space and Polity 1, no. 2: 149–169. doi: 10.1080/13562579708721761 [Taylor & Francis Online]   [Google Scholar] , 151). He continues by suggesting that the settlement of frontiers is a powerful tactic employed by the dominant group to maintain its hegemony 1 1.  In the Israeli case, according to Yiftachel ( 1998 Yiftachel, Oren. 1998. Nation-Building and the Division of Space: Ashkenazi Domination in the Israeli ‘Ethnocracy’. Nationalism and Ethnic Politics 4, no. 3: 33–58. doi: 10.1080/13537119808428537 [Taylor & Francis Online]   [Google Scholar] ), this hegemonic elite is the Ashkenazi Jews. There are two main ethno-cultural branches of the Jewish people, Ashkenazi and Mizrahi, or Sephardi. Ashkenazi Jews were endemic to Northern and Eastern Europe, while Mizrahi Jews came from Southern Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and the Caucuses. Social and historical research on Israel shows a tendency of political domination, cultural elitism and discrimination by an Ashkenazi “elite” over Mizrahi Jews although conditions are becoming more egalitarian. View all notes :\nSignificantly, internal frontiers also play a central role in nation- and state-building. These are “alien” areas within the collective's boundaries into which the core attempts to expand, penetrate and increase its control. (Yiftachel 1997 Yiftachel, Oren. 1997. Nation-Building or Ethnic Fragmentation? Frontier Settlement and Collective Identities in Israel. Space and Polity 1, no. 2: 149–169. doi: 10.1080/13562579708721761 [Taylor & Francis Online]   [Google Scholar] , 151)\nYiftachel aptly points out that internal frontiers are marginal spaces with a weak relation to the centers of power and control located at the core and has repeatedly used the Galilee region as a case study for the “frontier” (Yiftachel 1997 Yiftachel, Oren. 1997. Nation-Building or Ethnic Fragmentation? Frontier Settlement and Collective Identities in Israel. Space and Polity 1, no. 2: 149–169. doi: 10.1080/13562579708721761 [Taylor & Francis Online]   [Google Scholar] , 1998 Yiftachel, Oren. 1998.

Ethnic Frontiers and Peripheries: Landscapes of Development and Inequality in Israel.\nBoulder\n,\nCO\n: Westview Press.  [Google Scholar] ). However, the way he views the processes at work on the border takes an inflexibly top-down view that denies the possibility of local agency and cultural transformation, which this article shows to be subtly but powerfully changing the periphery. Furthermore, the unidirectional flow of power dictated by the core/periphery model ignores the ways in which the local cultures can form organically without strict orchestration from the core, or even dialogically with the core, and how cultural and social processes can “rebound” from the margins to reconfigure the center.\nI witnessed a moment of such potential transformation during a previous visit to the area in August, 2011. At the time, nationwide social protests were taking place in solidarity with the “tent city” protests in Tel Aviv over domestic concerns such as the lack of affordable housing and the high cost of living in Israel. At the entrance to the Druze village of Hurfeish, about 2.8 miles from the Blue Line, protesters had erected a large tent over the square containing an equestrian statue of the Druze hero Sultan Al-Atrash. Along with local youths burning tires in a display of dissent, the protesters had hung a large Druze flag and homemade signs around the square with political slogans. One of these entreated “Gilad and Bibi come home,” a call for both the return of the hostage Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who had been held captive in Gaza for over five years at that point, and for Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu to leave office. 2 2.  Bibi is a commonly used nickname for Netanyahu in the press and in public discourse. View all notes Another sign called for more housing to be funded for Druze ex-soldiers.\nThis instance shows Druze identification with the goals of the national protest movement and its participation within Israeli civil society. It also simultaneously highlights a demand for recognition of the community's Druze identity as distinct and viable, as evidenced by the symbolic significance of placing a tent over the statue of a revered Druze leader and the high visibility of the large Druze flag to those entering the village from the busy public road that cuts through it. The voice of the Druze community is also given weight in public discourse by the fact that, other than the small Muslim Circassian community, they are the only ethnic minority in Israel that face mandatory conscription into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). 3 3.  The “common wisdom” in Israel is that Druze leaders in the 1950s requested conscription out of patriotic duty and to facilitate Druze integration into Israeli society. However, recent scholarship has suggested that this decision was contentious and resulted from factionalism among the Druze leadership along with an element of coercion by the state (Cohen 2010 Cohen, Hillel. 2010. Good Arabs : The Israeli Security Agencies and the Israeli Arabs, 1948–1967.\nBerkeley\n: University of California Press.  [Google Scholar] , 159–161). View all notes Hence the significance of the sign in support of Shalit, since he was a national symbol as an “everyman” for all young conscripts who risk sacrificing “a quiet, peaceful, dignified life” for the security of the state (Leibovitz 2011 Leibovitz, Liel. 2011. Moving On. Tablet Magazine. http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/80664/moving-on .  [Google Scholar] ).\nSecurity and threat at the border\nDaily life in the Galilee is in part defined by its geopolitical position in proximity to the borders of the “enemy” states of Lebanon and Syria. This closeness is perceived as a root cause of threat, particularly in the form of Katyusha rocket fire and cross-border terror attacks from Hezbollah, the Shiite political and militant group that controls southern Lebanon, and Palestinian militant factions in Lebanon. As a result, the area features prominently in the national security discourse and is materially securitized through architecture, military technologies and bodily practices.\nTwo diametric psychological operations work simultaneously at Israel's northern borders in relation to danger and security, fear and normalization. Fear reflects the deep anxiety inhabitants face about the possible threat of bodily harm from rockets, artillery, bombs and gunfire. Normalization is a “tactic” deployed by residents to make everyday life livable in the face of adversity (Certeau 1984 Certeau, Michel de. 1984. The Practice of Everyday Life.\nBerkeley\n: University of California Press.  [Google Scholar] : xix).\nMegoran presents the notion of danger as worthy of consideration at the local level in his work on Uzbekistan. He cites the dominant academic discussions of danger in the realist “international relations literature, where it is commonly discussed in terms of challenges to the ‘security’ or survival of a state” (Megoran 2005 Megoran, Nick. 2005. The Critical Geopolitics of Danger in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 23, no. 4: 555–580. doi: 10.1068/d56j [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 558). In contrast, the main position articulated by critical geopolitics is that danger should “be considered a subjective and politicized exercise rather than an objective assessment” (Megoran 2005 Megoran, Nick. 2005. The Critical Geopolitics of Danger in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 23, no. 4: 555–580. doi: 10.1068/d56j [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 559). Dalby argues that “the mobilization of ‘discourses of danger’” gives authority to the state “as the providers of protection, or ‘security’” (Dalby 1993 Dalby, Simon. 1993. The ‘Kiwi Disease’: Geopolitical Discourse in Aotearoa/New Zealand and the South Pacific. Political Geography 12, no. 5: 437–456. doi: 10.1016/0962-6298(93)90012-V [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 439). Furthermore, he suggests that “threats” are spatialized relative to their proximity to a given state, with closer threats being “portrayed” as more dangerous while those further away are constructed as “less dangerous.” However, Dalby qualifies that intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and the political and economic forces of globalization have “complicated” this model (Dalby 1993 Dalby, Simon. 1993. The ‘Kiwi Disease’: Geopolitical Discourse in Aotearoa/New Zealand and the South Pacific. Political Geography 12, no. 5: 437–456. doi: 10.1016/0962-6298(93)90012-V [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ).\nIn his work on the Finnish–Russian border, Paasi has theorized that the idea of threat to territorial sovereignty is “inextricably bound” with national “identity formation” (Paasi 1996; paraphrased from Megoran 2005, 559–560). As the previous section illustrates, identity in the northern Israeli borderland is too heterogeneous and complicated to suggest a monolithic national identity or positive identification with the state in binary opposition to Lebanon as a dangerous “Other,” particularly among Arabs and Druze. However, safety and security is demanded from the state from both the Jewish majority and minority groups through the language of citizens’ rights and state responsibility (Mossawa Center 2006 Mossawa Center. 2006. The Arab Citizens of Israel and the 2006 War in Lebanon: Reflections and Realities.\nHaifa\n: Mossawa Center. http://www.mossawa.org/files/files/File/Reports/2006/TheArabCitizensofIsraelandthe2006WarinLebanon.pdf .  [Google Scholar] ).\nThe landscape of Israel's border with Lebanon is proliferated by the materialities of security. The area contains a network of radar installations, military bases, fences, patrol roads, soldiers with guns, armoured vehicles, hidden air raid sirens and bomb shelters. Furthermore, the materialities and bodily practices of security even penetrate within the private sphere of the home. Water security is kept in mind when saving any unused drinking water or putting buckets in the shower to save the water that would be wasted while it is warming up to be used for cleaning or watering plants. Another example is that Israeli law requires the inclusion of a “bombproof” reinforced concrete room in every house.\nThe most overt security threat faced by civilians in the North is rocket fire from Hezbollah militants and other factions based in southern Lebanon. The bulk of the projectiles fired throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the 2006 war and occasionally after that conflict are the short-range 122 mm Grad “Katyusha” rockets based on a Soviet design with a maximum range of 25 km. The advantages of these rockets for militants are that they are inexpensive, easy to stockpile and conceal due to their relatively small size and they can be prepared and fired very quickly from mobile launchers, making it hard for the Israeli Air Force to identify and neutralize launch sites. Due to their “lack of a guidance system” Katyushas are extremely inaccurate and have the most impact when fired in volleys (Gardner 2006 Gardner, Frank. 2006. Hezbollah Missile Threat Assessed. BBC News. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/5242566.stm .  [Google Scholar] ).\nDiscourses about Katyushas are tied to their physical properties. A report by the American think-tank The Jamestown Foundation suggests that by “firing Katyusha-type rockets singly … Hezbollah has forgone the tactical use of this weapon for strategic purposes” instead using them as “political” weapons in “media warfare” as acts of “defiance” that “signal to the Arab world that Israel is not invincible” (McGregor 2006 McGregor, Andrew. 2006. Hezbollah's Rocket Strategy. Terrorism Monitor.\nWashington\n,\nDC\n: The Jamestown Foundation. http://www.jamestown.org/programs/gta/single/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=869&tx_ttnews[backPid]=181&no_cache=1 .  [Google Scholar] ). Hezbollah also combined rocket fire with “psychological operations” within Israel to influence public opinion towards its goals. It used the communications equipment of its Al-Manar network to broadcast television messages targeted at Israeli audiences “complete with Hebrew subtitles calling on them to go back to Europe and the United States” (McGregor 2006 McGregor, Andrew. 2006. Hezbollah's Rocket Strategy. Terrorism Monitor.\nWashington\n,\nDC\n: The Jamestown Foundation. http://www.jamestown.org/programs/gta/single/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=869&tx_ttnews[backPid]=181&no_cache=1 .  [Google Scholar] , 15). Schleifer argues that “these transmissions … [sought] to create in the Israeli mind a frightening connection between Al-Manar's ability to target their televisions sets and Hezbollah's ability to shell their homes” (McGregor 2006 Schleifer, Ron. 2006. Psychological Operations: A New Variation on an Age Old Art: Hezbollah versus Israel. Studies in Conflict & Terrorism 29, no. 1: 1–19. doi: 10.1080/10576100500351185 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 15). Hezbollah also cited its ability to continue firing rockets at Israel, despite heavy bombardment and a ground invasion by the well-equipped and highly trained IDF, as proof of its “victory” in the 2006 war. This ability had as much to do with the compactness, portability and operational efficiency of the rockets as it did the determination or martial prowess of the fighters who used them. These nonconventional uses of both missiles and communications technologies to circumvent the border fence and the impact for those on the other side support Elden's call to move towards a “volumetric” understanding of territory that “goes up and down” rather than “just exist[ing] as a surface” (Elden 2013 Elden, Stuart. 2013. Secure the Volume: Vertical Geopolitics and the Depth of Power. Political Geography 34, no. 1: 35–51. doi: 10.1016/j.polgeo.2012.12.009 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 49).\nBecause they are unguided, inaccurate by design and are launched at an area with a high Arab population, a moral condemnation was voiced by informants, and hinted at in newspaper reports, that they indiscriminately harm both Jews and Arabs. This accusation is intended to refute Hezbollah's public claim to represent broader Arab interests, in addition to Shiite ones, in the region against Israel. One informant recounted the story of three Arab youths from Tarshiha, who were killed when driving near the town. In response to another instance, a 2011 article on Ynet, the online outlet of centre-left Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, used the headline “Lebanese woman hit by Katyusha” for an article describing how a misfired rocket directed at Israel landed on an apartment block inside Lebanon to draw attention to the fact that rocket attacks also harm the antagonists’ own compatriots (Ynet News 2011 Ynet News. 2011. Lebanese Woman Hit by Katyusha. Ynet News. http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4160264,00.html .  [Google Scholar] ).\nAn editorial piece by a security analyst in the right-leaning English language daily The Jerusalem Post about the most recent rocket attack to hit Israel in late 2011, explicates the discursive use of weapons as a form of communication in the absence of verbal dialogue. The author cites Hezbollah's restraint considering its “capability to simultaneously launch hundreds of rockets as far south as the city of Dimona at nearly a moment's notice” to argue that rocket fire from Lebanon is always a calculated action permitted by Hezbollah and “its backers in Iran and Syria,” sometimes using Sunni and Palestinian militant groups as proxies (Nisman 2011 Nisman, Daniel. 2011. Northern Border: Rocket Attacks Are a Sign of the Times. The Jerusalem Post, Jerusalem. http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=247650 .  [Google Scholar] ). He also argues that these incidents are not isolated, but rather contingent on contemporaneous events in the Middle East, including those involving the Palestinians. A worded articulation of the most recent flare-up, including Israel's characteristic response of “symbolic artillery barrages in open areas,” is:\nthat the Iranians and Syrians wanted to warn the state of Israel that operations to undermine Iranian or Syrian aspirations will not go unchecked. Israel's limited response, as well, was meant to send a message that it will retaliate for any provocation, but yet does not seek a major conflict. (Nisman 2011 Nisman, Daniel. 2011. Northern Border: Rocket Attacks Are a Sign of the Times. The Jerusalem Post, Jerusalem. http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=247650 .  [Google Scholar] )\nThis analysis both exemplifies the power of weapons to articulate discourse, in lieu of speech acts, and the view of their use in the Israeli–Lebanese conflict as a clever form of gamesmanship in the realpolitik outlook of dominant Israeli security discourses.\nThe combined factors of the proximity of the northern border to Lebanon, and Hezbollah and allied militant groups’ predilection for Katyushas, gives the region a reputation as a home front under siege within Israeli public discourse and in the media. Civilian experiences play a prominent role in articles from two of three Israeli newspapers reporting on the same rocket attack discussed above. While both articles from The Jerusalem Post focused on the regional implications and focused on “elite” international relations discourses (Lappin and Katz 2011 Lappin, Yaakov, and Yaakov Katz. 2011. Lebanese Rockets – an Indirect Message? Jerusalem Post, Jerusalem. http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Article.aspx?id=247355 .  [Google Scholar] ; Nisman 2011 Nisman, Daniel. 2011. Northern Border: Rocket Attacks Are a Sign of the Times. The Jerusalem Post, Jerusalem. http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=247650 .  [Google Scholar] ), the articles from Ynet and the left-wing daily Haaretz both discussed the human concerns, although in slightly different ways.\nThe Haaretz article used a quote from a local civic official to highlight a “business as usual” attitude that valorized an Israeli cultural trait of “toughness” in the face of terror. It also added a critique of the retaliatory imperative of “elite” security actors by paraphrasing the same official as saying “Israel's defense establishment should carefully weigh its options following the rocket fire,” as well as advocating for the implementation of the Iron Dome rocket interception system in the North (Ashkenazi, Khoury, and Harel 2011 Ashkenazi, Eli, Jack Khoury, and Amos Harel. 2011. Al-Qaida Linked Group Claims Responsibility for Katyusha Fire against Israel. Haaretz. Tel Aviv. http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/al-qaida-linked-group-claims-responsibility-for-katyusha-fire-against-israel-1.398495 .  [Google Scholar] ). In contrast, Ynet spent the latter half of its article emphasizing the traumatic effect of the incident for local residents. One resident is quoted as saying “[my] entire village is in shock” and another is written about describing “a mushroom cloud billowing in the sky followed by the thick smell of gunpowder. ‘It was 20 meters from my house,’ he added” (Buchnik 2011 Buchnik, Maor. 2011. UNIFIL to Probe Katyusha Fire at Western Galilee. Ynet News. Tel Aviv. http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4154458,00.html .  [Google Scholar] ).\nThis section has demonstrated how danger is related to both proximity and national identity at Israel's northern border. The closeness of the area to Hezbollah's southern Lebanese heartland creates a sense of threat for border residents, while at the same time a “keep calm and carry on” attitude seeks to normalize this danger in order to perpetuate an image of stoicism and brave resilience that feature in Israeli narratives of national character. However, these two ways of thinking and acting in response to the specific aspect of danger cannot adequately account for the complexity of geographical imaginations at the border. The incompleteness of a border view solely predicated on threat can be partially explained by the fluidity and lack of absolute difference inherent to the borderland concept.\nA hostile imagination?\nThe borderland can be theorized as a “place of contact, confluence and hybridity” (Popescu 2012 Popescu, Gabriel. 2012. Bordering and Ordering the Twenty-First Century : Understanding Borders.\nLanham\n,\nMD\n: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. [Kindle Edition]  [Google Scholar] , 80), although caution should be used against suggesting that these identities are necessarily fluid and coherent. Saada-Ophir writes that “this new perspective presents the borderland as an evasive space of interwoven entities, emerging through ongoing negotiations between state policies, such as border patrols, checkpoints, and containment walls, and the agency of those residing there” (Saada-Ophir 2006 Saada-Ophir, Galit. 2006. Borderland Pop: Arab Jewish Musicians and the Politics of Performance. Cultural Anthropology 21, no. 2: 205–233. doi: 10.1525/can.2006.21.2.205 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 206–207). The “evasiveness” of the border can be evinced by the multiple, fragmented entities that are tactically performed in different ways in different contexts as means of “making do” (Certeau 1984 Certeau, Michel de. 1984. The Practice of Everyday Life.\nBerkeley\n: University of California Press.  [Google Scholar] , 29–30).\nDespite the material threat faced by the northern border's residents from sporadic bouts of rocket fire from Lebanon, this does not lead to a Manichaean imagination of Lebanon as a dangerous Other. Rather, both border residents and the Israeli political establishment tend to identify Hezbollah as a primary threat, rather than the Lebanese state. This is evidenced in the repeated discussion of “Hezbollah” as an antagonist rather than “Lebanon” in the newspaper discourse analysis conducted in the previous section. Furthermore, my informants discussed Hezbollah as a direct threat rather than Lebanon. For example, one informant described feeling threatened by a Hezbollah flag that was visible from a farm across the border fence. Another informant, Avi, a 25-year-old former conscript in the IDF who was stationed in the Shebaa Farms area along the border, described the danger of ambush from Hezbollah fighters as the main threat he faced, rather than Lebanese government forces.\nIn fact, my research suggests that one of the most prominent cultural imaginations at work concerning Lebanon is indifference. Residents of the areas I observed were more interested with going about their day-to-day business and were able to do so by ignoring danger from across the border. Furthermore, most of the people I spoke to did not view Lebanon or Lebanese people diametrically in malignant terms as “the enemy.” Moshe, a Jewish small business owner from Maalot in his 40s, epitomized this attitude when asked what he thought about Lebanese people (in the context of the conflict between Israel and Lebanon):\nI'm not worried. If I have to worry, they have to too. They're just like me. They don't want to put up with the same shit. It's the governments who are worried.\nMoshe's reply explicitly rejects the “elite” discourse of the state which classifies Lebanon as an “enemy.” His statement also conveys an empathy with the position of the supposed “Other” that contradicts the binary “geographical imagination” posited by Gregory.\nThe complexity of border identities is also evinced by the positive imaginations that work alongside the indifferent and “dangerous” cultural imaginations of Lebanon. During my research I was able to identify several recurring motifs in how Lebanon was imagined by my informants. One is that Lebanon is more cosmopolitan and “westernized” than other Middle Eastern countries. This is congruous with the well circulated aphorism in Europe that Beirut is “the Paris of the Middle East,” and implies that the Lebanese worldview is less threatening than other Middle Eastern countries, such as Saudi Arabia or Iran, where Islamic fundamentalism is perceived to be the dominant outlook. Tourism was another theme that came up in terms of future possibility. Avi, the informant described above, when asked what he thought about Lebanon, discussed wanting to visit Lebanon to go skiing. He elaborated by saying it was supposed to be a great location for the sport and that many Europeans had holiday homes in the Lebanese mountains. The positive futurity of his answer suggests that tourism could be deciphered as a metonym for peace between the two states.\nStokes notes that the “non-verbal domain” is a vital “cultural resource in the management of border lives” since it is where “people are often able to embrace notions of hybridity and plurality which are often unsayable” (Stokes 1998 Stokes, Martin. 1998. Imagining ‘the South’: Hybridity, Heterotopias and Arabesk on the Turkish-Syrian Border. In Border Identities: Nation and State at International Frontiers, ed. Thomas M. Wilson and Hastings Donnan, 263–288.\nCambridge\n: Cambridge University Press. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] , 264). Within this non-verbal domain the material and symbolic engagement that occurs through the consumption of food and drink can in a commodified setting can be “reshaped” to the “advantage” of marginal groups and that a “more complex view of commodification acknowledges the many ways in which objects become ‘entangled’ in a web of wider social relations and meanings” (Jackson 1999 Jackson, Peter. 1999. Commodity Cultures: The Traffic in Things. Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 24, no. 1: 95–108. doi: 10.1111/j.0020-2754.1999.00095.x [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 101).\nIn the Druze village of Hurfeish mentioned previously, which is a fifteen-minute drive from Maalot, the highly conspicuous symbols of flags are used publicly in commercial spaces to express a complicated projection of Druze identity. The main concentration of shops and restaurants are located along Route 89, the main thoroughfare that bisects the village. Israeli flags and a few five-coloured Druze flags are visible in front of many of the shops and houses near the highway and on the hills ascending from the highway. One of the village's main draws are the several restaurants serving the Druze specialty sambusek, a filled flatbread served with locally produced olives. In one such restaurant I ate at, there were pennants with Israeli flags strung from the ceiling. Another sambusek restaurant visible from the highway flew an Israeli flag flanked by two Druze flags on the outside signage, which also used as its logo a cedar tree, an iconographic metonym for Lebanon. The glass front of the restaurant, shown in Figure 2 , had an Israeli flag and a Lebanese flag on opposite sides. This indicates both the Druze assertion of their unique identity, as well as their claim for recognition as part of the greater Israeli. The inclusion of the Lebanese flag and the “cedar of Lebanon” in this arrangement also proclaims Hurfeish's Druze population's cultural ties to Lebanon. 4 4.  A caveat should be noted that Druze political views within Israel are in no way homogenous or unified. Druze MKs in the Knesset at the time of writing ranged across the political spectrum from the Arab interest left-wing Balad party to the centrist Kadima party to the ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party.

Road vehicles account for almost half of the energy used in all transport modes globally. Reducing energy use in vehicles is key to meeting the forecast increase in demand for transport, while improving energy security and mitigating climate change. Non-powertrain vehicle options may reduce fuel consumption by at least 15%. Electric motors are the significant powertrain option to reduce energy use in vehicles because they are more efficient than the internal combustion engine and can recover a portion of the vehicle kinetic energy during braking. Conventionally, batteries are used to meet both the power and energy demands of electric vehicles and their variants. However, batteries are well-suited to store energy, while ultra-capacitors and high-speed flywheels are better placed to meet the bidirectional, high power requirements of real-world driving. Combining technologies with complementary strengths can yield a lower cost and more efficient energy storage system. While pure and hybrid electric vehicles use less energy than internal combustion engine vehicles, their ability to mitigate climate change is a function of the emissions intensity of the processes used to generate their electricity.\nItem Type:\n""","0.42540616","""http://publications.eng.cam.ac.uk/681604/""",

Similar electric vehicle targets have been introduced in other countries. However, reducing energy consumption and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions in transport is a considerable challenge due to heavy reliance on fossil fuels. In fact, transport in the Republic of Ireland in 2009 accounted for 29% of non-emissions trading scheme greenhouse gas emissions, 32% of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, 21% of total greenhouse gas emissions and approximately 50% of energy-related non-emission trading scheme greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper the effect of electric vehicle charging on the operation of the single wholesale electricity market for the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland is analysed. The energy consumed, greenhouse gas emissions generated and changes to the wholesale price of electricity under peak and off-peak charging scenarios are quantified and discussed. Results from the study show that off-peak charging is more beneficial than peak charging.\nLinks\n""","1.2415924","""http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/an-analysis-of-the-effect-of-electric-vehicle-charging-on-the-operation-of-the-single-electricity-market(55546d45-53a3-47bf-a513-df92b534dedb).html""","[-5.934759,54.583863]"

We administered questionnaires (n = 815), skin prick tested children (n = 717) and measured specific serum IgE (n = 478) to inhalant and food allergens. Main outcomes were current rhinitis (CR) and current rhinoconjunctivitis (CRC).\nResults: The prevalence of CR and CRC was 26.1% and 12.1%, respectively. The risk of CR and CRC increased significantly with increasing IgE to grass, mite and cat; CRC was also associated with increasing IgE to dog and peanut. Similarly, increasing SPT-MWDs to inhalant allergens were significantly associated with CR and CRC. This association was also shown for grass within the group of atopic children. Perennial and seasonal rhinitis were associated with increasing IgE/SPT-MWD to mite and grass, respectively. Moderate/severe rhinitis was associated with increasing IgE/SPT-MWD to grass. In a multivariate analysis, increasing levels of IgE/SPT-MWD to grass were the strongest independent predictors of both CR (for IgE: OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.23–1.64, P < 0.001) and CRC (for IgE: 1.51, 1.30–1.76, P < 0.001).\nConclusion: The probability of CR/CRC increases with increasing specific IgE levels or SPT-MWD. With respect to allergic rhinitis, the absolute levels of specific IgE antibody or the size of SPT wheal offer more information than just the presence/absence of sensitization.\nAccepted for publication 26 June 2007\nRelated content\nArticles related to the one you are viewing\nCiting Literature\nNumber of times cited: 47\n1\nMarilena M.

"""Imperial_College_London""","""Environmental Health Perspectives – Air Pollution Exposure during Pregnancy and Childhood Autistic Traits in Four European Population-Based Cohort Studies: The ESCAPE Project""","""Supplemental Table of Contents PDF (132 KB)\nIntroduction\nAutism spectrum disorders (ASD) are lifelong developmental disabilities characterized by social interaction impairment, communication deficits, and repetitive behaviors ( van Engeland and Buitelaar 2008 ). The prevalence of ASD has increased in the past 20 years, reaching 1 in 86 children in Europe in 2007 ( Posada et al. 2007 ). Despite advances in genetic research, the causes of ASD remain unclear ( Betancur 2011 ). A possible etiologic role for environmental factors has been suggested, particularly during pregnancy ( Dietert et al. 2011 ).\nTwo recent case–control studies in California showed that ASD in children 2–6 years of age was associated with prenatal exposure to traffic-related air pollutants ( Becerra et al. 2013 ;  Volk et al. 2011 ,  2013 ), but the results of a twin study from Sweden did not confirm that finding ( Gong et al. 2014 ). Another case–control study among children of Nurses’ Health Study II participants reported an association between prenatal exposure to PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm) ( Raz et al. 2015 ) and other air pollutants such as diesel or metals at birth ( Roberts et al. 2013 ) and ASD. Two case–control studies were also carried out in the United States, one showing a significant association of ASD with higher ambient air concentrations of metals at birth ( Windham et al. 2006 ), and another showing null associations between several pollutants at birth and ASD after adjusting for confounders ( Kalkbrenner et al. 2010 ). Brain toxicity of urban air pollutants during development is well documented in animals, and possible biological pathways have been suggested ( Block et al. 2012 ).\nAutistic traits are defined as subclinical deficits in socialization, communication, and repetitive behaviors that do not meet formal criteria for an ASD diagnosis ( Constantino and Todd 2003 ). It has been shown that known genetic and environmental influences are consistent across the range of impairment of the continuous autistic trait, indicating an etiologic overlap between very extreme scores, mild impairment, and subthreshold autism-like behavior ( Robinson et al. 2011 ). To date, no study has examined the association of air pollution with the presence of autistic quantitative traits in the general population. In this study we aimed to assess whether prenatal air pollution exposure including nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and PM is associated with autistic traits in childhood in four European population-based birth/child cohort studies.\nMethods\nPopulation and study design. This study was part of the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE), in which the association between exposure to outdoor air pollution and health is being investigated within prospective cohort studies ( http://www.escapeproject.eu ). We included three European population-based birth cohorts: Generation R (the Netherlands) ( Jaddoe et al. 2012 ), GASPII (Gene and Environment: Prospective Study on Infancy in Italy) ( Porta et al. 2006 ), and INMA (INfancia y Medio Ambiente; Childhood and Environment; Spain, including three subcohorts) ( Guxens et al. 2012 ), and a European longitudinal child and adolescent twin study: CATSS (Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden) ( Anckarsäter et al. 2011 ) ( Table 1 ). Mother–child pairs were recruited from 1992 through 2008. A total of 8,079 children with available data on exposures, outcome, and potential confounders were included (62.2% of the children recruited at baseline). Informed consent was obtained from all participants in each cohort and ethical approval was obtained from the local authorized institutional review boards.\nTable 1 – Description of the participating birth cohort studies.\nView larger image (TIF File) \nAir pollution exposure. Air pollution concentrations at the participants’ birth home addresses were estimated for the whole pregnancy period of each woman by land-use regression models following a standardized procedure described elsewhere ( Beelen et al. 2013 ;  Eeftens et al. 2012a ) (see Supplemental Material, “Methods S1. Description of the air pollution assessment”). Briefly, air pollution monitoring campaigns were performed in the study areas between October 2008 and January 2011. In all areas, three 2-week measurements of NO2 and nitrogen oxides (NOx) were performed within 1 year ( Cyrys et al. 2013 ). In all cohorts except in the Spanish cohorts of Valencia and Gipuzkoa, simultaneous measurements of PM10 (PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm), PM2.5, PM with aerodynamic diameters between 2.5 and 10 μm (PMcoarse), and PM2.5 absorbance (determined as the reflectance of PM2.5 filters) were performed ( Eeftens et al. 2012b ) ( Table 1 ). We developed land-use regression models for each pollutant metric using all measurement sites and used them to estimate annual average air pollution concentration at the participants’ birth home addresses. We used a back-extrapolation procedure to estimate pregnancy-average concentrations from annual average concentration using routine background monitoring network sites ( Pedersen et al. 2013 ). Traffic intensity on the nearest road and total traffic load (intensity × length) on all major roads within a 100-m buffer were available for some cohorts.\nAutistic traits. Autistic traits were assessed in children using the Autism Spectrum Disorder module of the Autism—Tics, Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorders, and Other Comorbidities (A-TAC) inventory ( Anckarsäter et al. 2011 ) in the Swedish cohort at age 9 or 12 years; the Pervasive Developmental Problems (PDP) subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist for Toddlers (CBCL1½–5) ( Achenbach and Rescorla 2000 ) in the Dutch cohort at age 6 years and in the Italian cohort at age 4 years; an adapted 18-item version of the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) ( Constantino and Gruber 2005 ;  Román et al. 2013 ) in the Dutch cohort at age 6 years; and the Childhood Autism Spectrum Test (CAST) ( Baron-Cohen et al. 2009 ) in the Spanish cohorts at age 4–5 years ( Table 1 ; see also Supplemental Material, “Methods S2. Description of the autistic traits assessment” and Table S1). The A-TAC, the CBCL1½–5, and the adapted 18-item SRS were parent-reported questionnaires, whereas the CAST was a questionnaire administered to the parents by a psychologist. For all tests, higher scores indicated more autistic traits. We considered all scores as quantitative traits. We also used validated cut-offs to yield proxies for autistic traits within the borderline/clinical (borderline or clinical) range and within the clinical range only, specific for each test ( Larson et al. 2010 ;  Tick et al. 2007 ;  Williams et al. 2005 ), except for the adapted 18-item SRS, for which these cut-offs are not defined. Validation studies reported high sensitivity (0.85–0.99) for borderline/clinical cut-offs and high specificity (0.95–0.97) for clinical cut-offs (see Supplemental Material, “Methods S2. Description of the autistic traits assessment” and Table S1).\nPotential confounding variables. Potential confounding variables were defined a priori as similarly as possible across cohorts, given available information. Maternal characteristics were collected by questionnaires during pregnancy or at birth: age at delivery, educational level (≤ 9, 10–12, ≥ 12 years in the Swedish cohort; ≤ 11, 12–15, ≥ 16 years in the Spanish cohort; primary, secondary, or ≥ university in the Dutch and Italian cohorts), country of birth, prenatal smoking, and parity. Maternal height and prepregnancy weight were measured or self-reported in the first trimester of pregnancy or at birth. Prepregnancy body mass index (kilograms per meter squared) was calculated. Child’s sex and date of birth were obtained from hospital or national registries. We also collected child’s age at autistic trait assessment and information on the evaluator (parents, psychologist) of the autistic traits. Urbanicity at child’s birth address (urban, rural) was defined (urban classification: municipalities with > 40 inhabitants per hectare in the Swedish cohort; municipalities with > 2,000 inhabitants in the Dutch, Italian, and Spanish cohorts). Mothers reported on changes in residence (since birth until autistic trait assessment) through questionnaires.\nStatistical analyses. All analyses were performed following a consensus protocol. We used logistic regression models to assess the association between air pollution exposure and autistic traits within the borderline/clinical and within the clinical range. For both analyses we considered children with scores below the borderline cut-off as controls. Because few children were classified as having autistic traits within the clinical range in the Spanish cohorts of Gipuzkoa and Sabadell, we did not include them in that analysis. We used negative binomial regression models to assess the association between air pollution exposure and autistic traits as a quantitative score. Models for the Swedish cohort include a random intercept to take into account that children were clustered in twin pairs.\nFirst, models were adjusted for child’s age and sex (minimally adjusted models). When child’s age did not have a linear relationship with the autistic traits scales, we used the best transformation of the age found using fractional polynomials. Second, models were additionally adjusted for all covariates described above (fully adjusted models). Generalized additive models were used to assess the linearity of the relationship between each air pollutant and autistic trait scales by graphical examination and deviance comparison. Linear function provided a good fit in all cases. Spatial clustering of observations was explored by adding random cohort-level intercepts (Swedish cohort: small administrative units; Dutch cohort: neighborhood; Italian and Spanish cohorts: census area) to fully-adjusted models without the air pollution data. The inclusion of the spatial clustering component had a negligible impact on the Akaike Information Criterion. We used a two-stage approach to estimate the associations of air pollution exposure on autistic traits in children. First, associations were analyzed separately for each cohort. Second, cohort-specific effect estimates from the logistic regression models were combined using random-effects meta-analysis. We assessed heterogeneity in the estimates using the Q test and the I2 statistic. Because quantitative scales of the autistic trait tests used in different cohorts did not share a common metric, meta-analyses of cohort-specific effect estimates on the autistic traits as continuous variables were not possible.\nWe performed several sensitivity analyses: a) meta-analyses leaving out one cohort at a time to determine the influence of a particular cohort, b) meta-analyses including the cohorts with information on both NO2 and PM (89% of the children), c) meta-analyses using the 90th percentile as a cut-off regardless of the scale because borderline/clinical and clinical cut-offs were specific to the scale used in each cohort, d) meta-analyses stratified by type of evaluator of the autistic traits (psychologist, parents), e) meta-analyses assessing the non–back-extrapolated air pollution variables, f) meta-analyses including children who had a stable residence from birth until the autistic traits assessment, g) meta-analyses restricted to children of highly educated mothers and meta-analysis restricted to children of mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy in order to assess potential modifications of the air pollution effects by these factors, and h) meta-analyses stratified by child’s sex because some studies found different association in boys and girls. Power sample calculation can be found in the Supplemental Material, Table S2. Statistical tests of hypotheses were two-tailed with significance set at p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were conducted using STATA (version 12.1; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).\nResults\nBetween 3.2% and 12.3% of children were classified as having autistic traits within the borderline/clinical range, and between 0.7% and 3.6% were classified as having autistic traits within the clinical range ( Table 1 ). Children defined as having autistic traits within the borderline/clinical range or within the clinical range showed consistent associations with the assessed child and maternal characteristics across all cohorts ( Table 2 ). Children who had autistic traits within the borderline/clinical range and within the clinical range were mostly boys and had a higher proportion of mothers with low educational level and mothers who smoked during pregnancy compared with children without autistic traits ( Table 2 ).\nTable 2 – Distribution of the child and maternal characteristics.\nView larger image (TIF File) \nMedian air pollution levels ranged from 17.9 μg/m3 (the Swedish cohort) to 42.2 μg/m3 (the Italian cohort) for NO2, and from 8.4 μg/m3 (the Swedish cohort) to 22.4 μg/m3 (the Italian cohort) for PM2.5 ( Figure 1 ). Different correlation patterns between air pollution variables were found in the different cohorts (see Supplemental Material, Table S3). Overall, the correlation among air pollutants was strong (between 0.72 and 0.98), whereas the correlation between air pollutants and traffic variables was moderate or low (between 0.17 and 0.53).\nFigure 1 – Distribution of air pollutant levels during pregnancy: (A) NO2; (B) NOx; (C) PM10; (D) PM2.5; (E) PMcoarse; (F) PM2.5 absorbance. Air pollution levels were temporally adjusted to the exact pregnancy period. Boxes extend from the 25th to the 75th percentile, vertical bars represent the median, whiskers extend 1.5 times the length of the interquartile range above and below the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively, and outliers are represented as points. PM10, PM2.5, PMcoarse, and PM2.5absorbance were not available in the Spanish cohorts of Gipuzkoa and Valencia.\nView larger image (TIF File) \nNone of the air pollutants were associated with autistic traits within the borderline/clinical range in the minimally adjusted models [odds ratio (OR) = 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.87, 1.19 per 10-μg/m3 increase average NO2 levels] (see Supplemental Material, Table S4). ORs changed only slightly in the fully adjusted models [changes of OR ranged from 0% (PM10) to 10% (PM2.5)] ( Table 3 ). Fully adjusted associations of NO2 and children with autistic traits within the borderline/clinical range including all the potential confounding variables are shown in Supplemental Material, Table S5. As shown in  Figure 2 , in most cohorts the associations with the different pollutants were consistently close to one. However, for the Spanish cohorts of Valencia and Gipuzkoa, NO2 and NOx exposure tended to have a slightly higher odds of autistic traits within the borderline/clinical range ( Figure 2 ). Analysis with autistic traits within the clinical range ( Table 3 ) and with autistic traits as quantitative scores (see Supplemental Material, Table S6) did not reveal any association with air pollution exposure.\nTable 3 – Fully adjusted combined associationsa between air pollution during pregnancyb and autistic traits within the borderline/clinical range.\nView larger image (TIF File) \nWe observed a similar lack of association in all sensitivity analyses: a) when cohorts were excluded one by one (see Supplemental Material, Table S7), b) when meta-analyses were restricted to cohorts with information on both NO2 and PM (see Supplemental Material, Table S8), c) when we used the 90th percentile of each autistic traits scale (see Supplemental Material, Table S9), d) when we stratified the meta-analyses by the type of evaluator (psychologist, parents) (see Supplemental Material, Table S10), e) when we assessed the non–back-extrapolated air pollution variables (see Supplemental Material, Table S11), f) when meta-analyses were restricted to children with postnatal stable residence (see Supplemental Material, Table S12), g) when meta-analyses were restricted to children of highly educated mothers (see Supplemental Material, Table S12) and children of mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy (see Supplemental Material, Table S12), and h) when meta-analyses were stratified by child’s sex (see Supplemental Material, Table S13).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study we assessed the relationship between prenatal air pollution exposure including NO2 and PM and autistic traits in > 8,000 children of four European population-based birth/child cohorts. We found no evidence for an association between prenatal air pollution exposure and autistic traits in children 4–10 years of age. These results were consistent for all air pollutants assessed, across countries, using different cut-offs of autistic traits, examining autistic traits as continuous variables, and after adjusting for several socioeconomic status variables and urbanicity.\nThe strengths of our study were the large sample size in combination with the prospective and longitudinal study design, the use of a standardized and validated air pollution assessment in all countries, the assessment of exposure to a large number of air pollutants including NO2 and PM at the individual level, the assessment of autistic traits in childhood using standardized and validated neuropsychological tests, and the statistical analysis following a consensus protocol. Additionally, we adjusted for many socioeconomic and lifestyle variables known to be associated with air pollution exposure and/or autistic traits in children.\nThe main limitation of our study was that four different tests were used in the different cohorts to assess autistic traits. All four tests are valid tools for assessment of children’s behavior in epidemiological studies ( Constantino and Gruber 2005 ;  Larson et al. 2010 ;  Sikora et al. 2008 ;  Williams et al. 2005 ), though only two were developed to specifically address autistic traits (SRS and CAST). The other two (CBCL½–5 and A-TAC) have been most commonly used as screening tests for a broader range of behavioral profile and disorders including autistic traits. Although all tests include items corresponding to the three core features of ASD (social interaction deficits, communication deficits, and repetitive behaviors), each test includes a different number of items and gives a slightly different weight to each feature. These differences might imply that each instrument classifies children at risk for ASD in a slightly different way. However, children defined as having autistic traits within the borderline/clinical range or within the clinical range showed consistent associations with the assessed child and maternal characteristics across all cohorts ( Table 2 ). Moreover, we found consistent null association between prenatal air pollution exposure and autistic traits among cohorts regardless of the type of instrument, the age of assessment, the type of evaluator of the test, and the treatment of the scales using different cut-offs or using it as a quantitative trait. Another limitation of our study is related to the exposure assessment. Air pollution levels were back-extrapolated to the pregnancy period, and this could lead to a nondifferential misclassification of the exposure. Air pollution campaigns were performed when children were between 3 and 10 years of age, depending on the cohort. We used long-term routine monitoring data for the back-extrapolation to the exact pregnancy period for which we assumed that the spatial distribution of the sources and predictors of air pollution levels were stable with time. Previous research supports this by showing a stability of measured and modeled spatial contrast in air pollutants over a period of 10 and 12 years ( Cesaroni et al. 2012 ;  Eeftens et al. 2011 ). However, because monitoring data were not available for all pollutants in all cohorts, particularly for PM, we used background monitoring network sites of other pollutants in the cases of missing information. Nevertheless, we found that back-extrapolated and non–back-extrapolated results were essentially similar. Because correlation between whole pregnancy and trimester-specific air pollution concentrations was high in a previous ESCAPE study ( Pedersen et al. 2013 ), we did not attempt to calculate trimester-specific associations as these would not be expected to be different. Finally, paternal exposure to air pollution during the preconception phase may also play a role in the development of ASD, but this information was not available in our study.\nPrevious studies carried out in the United States found a consistently positive association between exposure to several air pollutants during pregnancy or during the first year of life and diagnosis of ASD ( Becerra et al. 2013 ;  Raz et al. 2015 ;  Roberts et al. 2013 ;  Volk et al. 2011 ,  2013 ;  Windham et al. 2006 ). Moreover, a study carried out in Taiwan found that postnatal exposure to NO2, ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide was associated with ASD in children from 3 to 9 years of age ( Jung et al. 2013 ). Results from previous studies seem contradictory to our findings. However, previous case–control studies selected children with a diagnosis of ASD, whereas in our study we studied children with autistic traits from population-based birth/child cohorts. A possible explanation for inconsistent findings could be that our study population does not represent the phenotypic extreme present in the case–control studies, because only a small number of children surpassed the threshold for ASD. We hypothesize that prenatal exposure to air pollution could be related to ASD but not associated with broad autistic traits in children. In our study we defined children with autistic traits within the clinical range using the clinical cut-off, which is shown to be specific for detecting children at risk for ASD, but results in small sample sizes. We found no indication of an association between prenatal air pollution exposure and autistic traits within the clinical range.\nResidual confounding could be another possible explanation of the discrepant findings between previous studies and our study. As in our study, most of the previous studies accounted for several potential confounding variables including maternal education, maternal age, prenatal maternal smoking, and urbanicity.  Becerra et al. (2013)  found an association between ASD and air pollution exposure only after adjusting for maternal educational level, whereas associations were similar between unadjusted and adjusted models in the other studies ( Volk et al. 2011 ,  2013 ). In our study, results were also materially unchanged after adjusting for confounders. Moreover, we observed similar results when we restricted our analyses to children of mothers with high educational levels or mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy. It is worth noting that children with diagnosis of ASD in some of the previous studies were more likely to come from high maternal socioeconomic backgrounds ( Becerra et al. 2013 ;  Kalkbrenner et al. 2010 ;  Windham et al. 2006 ), whereas children with autistic traits in all our cohort studies were more likely to have mothers with a low maternal socioeconomic status. This finding may reflect a systematic difference between the study of broad autistic traits and children with ASD diagnosis, or that the previous studies share a common bias, possibly a diagnostic bias related to socioeconomic status–related differences in access to care, that was not operating in the European cohorts ( Rai et al. 2012 ).\nAn alternative explanation of the contradictory findings could be differences in air pollution levels and sources. Air pollution levels at the extremes of the distributions in several of the previous studies are higher than those observed in our study, though exposure ranges do overlap [mean NO2 levels about 32–58 μg/m3 in California or Los Angeles county ( Becerra et al. 2013 ;  Volk et al. 2013 ) vs. 19–43 μg/m3 in our European cohorts; mean PM10 levels around 26–36 μg/m3 in California or Los Angeles county ( Becerra et al. 2013 ;  Volk et al. 2013 ) vs. 17–44 μg/m3 in our European cohorts; mean PM2.5 levels around 14–20 μg/m3 in California or Los Angeles ( Becerra et al. 2013 ;  Volk et al. 2013 ) county vs. 8–23 μg/m3 in our European cohorts]. In our study, NO2 and PM are markers of traffic air pollution, but also drive from sources such as space heating; small-scale traffic and population/household density variables were the most frequently used predictors in the land-use regression models ( Beelen et al. 2013 ;  Eeftens et al. 2012a ). In some previous studies associations with ASD were also observed with traffic indicators such as living near a freeway or modeled traffic-related air pollution exposure ( Volk et al. 2011 ,  2013 ). However, null association was observed in another study ( Gong et al. 2014 ) when air pollutant levels were estimated using dispersion models. Although NO2 or PM levels are similar, different exposure mixtures among study areas may result in different health effects. Based on experimental models, it has been hypothesized that PM-soluble components are one of the major suspected culprits of the neurological effects of air pollution, primarily metals, because they may translocate from the respiratory tract into the systemic circulation and reach the fetus and promote oxidative stress and inflammation ( Block et al. 2012 ). Further research including trace metal content of the PM, such as lead or manganese, is warranted to better understand the discrepant findings.\nIn conclusion, this study showed a null association between prenatal exposure to several air pollutants, including NO2 and PM, and autistic traits in children 4–10 years of age in four European population-based birth/child cohorts. Additional research including European studies of children with a diagnosis of ASD, a comparison of ASD manifestation and detection between the United States and Europe, and the study of the air pollutants mechanisms underlying the association with ASD is needed to further understand the different findings between previous studies and the present study.\nReferences\nAchenbach TM, Rescorla LA. 2000.

The only long term way to do this is via the electrification of powertrains combined with the production of low carbon electricity or hydrogen. Current assumptions and models, such as the IEA BLUE Map, demonstrate that this is technically possible, but assume growth in demand for transport services will only double by 2035 and triple by 2050, largely driven by growth in developing economies. However, another transport revolution, automated vehicles, could drive growth in transport services significantly further, which without electrification will have a large negative impact on efforts to curb transport related emissions. In contrast, it is shown in this paper that automated vehicles could significantly improve the economics of electric vehicles, and therefore make the electrification of powertrains more likely, which could help reduce emissions. Despite this uncertainty, little work has been done on understanding how these factors will affect each other, particularly the timing and uptake of automated vehicles and their effect on future transport related GHG emissions and economics, yet the impact on transport policy, infrastructure and society will be profound and should be of interest to policy makers, the automotive and energy industries, and society as a whole.\nDownload options Please wait...\nPublication details\nThe article was              received on 16 Jul 2014,              accepted on 11 Nov 2014  and            first published on 11 Nov 2014\nArticle type: Opinion\nAutomated vehicles and electrification of transport\nG.

The provision of ancillary services in the smart grid by electric vehicles is attractive to grid operators.

Likely aggregator revenues are insufficient to cover the additional battery degradation costs which would be borne by an existing electric vehicle owner. Moreover, aggregator revenues are insufficient to make electric vehicles competitive with conventional vehicles and encourage uptake by prospective consumers. Net annual costs and hourly compensation payments to electric vehicle owners were most sensitive to battery cost. The fleet provided firm fast reserve from 1900 h for 0.42 h, up to 2.7 h in the best cases. At best, likely aggregator revenue was 20 times less than the compensation required, up to 27,500 times at worst. The electric vehicle fleet may not be large enough to meet the firm fast reserve power and duration requirements until 2020. However, it may not be until 2030 that enough vehicles have been sold to provide this service cost-effectively. Even then, many more electric vehicles will be needed to meet the power level and duration requirements, both more often and for longer to enable participation in an all-day, everyday ancillary services market.\nItem Type:\n""","1.0","""http://publications.eng.cam.ac.uk/738432/""",

To achieve high regeneration efficiency and also guarantee vehicle's brake safety, the regenerative brake should be coordinated with the mechanical brake. Therefore, the regenerative braking control performance can be significantly affected by the structure of mechanical braking system and the brake blending control strategy.By-wire brake system, which mechanically decouples the brake pedal from the hydraulic brake circuits, can make the braking force modulation more flexible. Moreover, its inherent characteristic of ‘pedal-decouple’ makes it well suited for the implementation in the cooperative regenerative braking control of electrified vehicles.With the aims of regeneration efficiency and braking performance, a regenerative braking control algorithm for electrified vehicles equipped with a brake-by-wire system is researched in this paper. The layout of the adopted brake-by-wire system is introduced. The proposed regenerative braking control algorithm is illustrated. To validate the control performance of the algorithm, hardware-in-the-loop simulations are carried out. The simulation results show that, based on brake-by-wire system, the proposed control algorithm, coordinating regenerative brake and hydraulic brake well, can further improving the regeneration efficiency of electrified vehicle and guarantee the braking performance in the meantime.\nEvent:\n""","0.42619368","""http://papers.sae.org/2014-01-1791/""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

We investigated the effects of short-term exposure to diesel traffic in people with asthma in an urban, roadside environment.\nMethods\nWe recruited 60 adults with either mild or moderate asthma to participate in a randomized, crossover study. Each participant walked for 2 hours along a London street (Oxford Street) and, on a separate occasion, through a nearby park (Hyde Park). We performed detailed real-time exposure, physiological, and immunologic measurements.\nResults\nParticipants had significantly higher exposures to fine particles (<2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter), ultrafine particles, elemental carbon, and nitrogen dioxide on Oxford Street than in Hyde Park. Walking for 2 hours on Oxford Street induced asymptomatic but consistent reductions in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (up to 6.1%) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (up to 5.4%) that were significantly larger than the reductions in FEV1 and FVC after exposure in Hyde Park (P=0.04 and P=0.01, respectively, for the overall effect of exposure, and P<0.005 at some time points). The effects were greater in subjects with moderate asthma than in those with mild asthma. These changes were accompanied by increases in biomarkers of neutrophilic inflammation (sputum myeloperoxidase, 4.24 ng per milliliter after exposure in Hyde Park vs. 24.5 ng per milliliter after exposure on Oxford Street; P=0.05) and airway acidification (maximum decrease in pH, 0.04% after exposure in Hyde Park and 1.9% after exposure on Oxford Street; P=0.003). The changes were associated most consistently with exposures to ultrafine particles and elemental carbon.\nConclusions\nOur observations serve as a demonstration and explanation of the epidemiologic evidence that associates the degree of traffic exposure with lung function in asthma.\nIntroduction\nAir pollution from road traffic is a serious health hazard, and particulates from diesel exhaust have become cause for increasing concern. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated associations between ambient particulate matter and respiratory-associated morbidity and mortality; these effects may be greater among persons with preexisting respiratory disease, including asthma. 1,2\nDiesel engines emit relatively low concentrations of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, but as compared with gasoline engines of similar size, diesel engines can generate more than 100 times the number of particles per distance traveled 3 and are major contributors to atmospheric particulate pollution. In urban environments, almost 90% of traffic-generated particulate matter is from diesel exhaust. 4,5\nMany urban residents, including those with increased susceptibility to the effects of air pollution, have short-term exposure to diesel traffic during normal activities. Studies of humans in exposure chambers have shown that controlled exposure to diesel exhaust can provoke increased airway resistance 6,7 and bronchial inflammatory changes. 8-11 Such studies are limited by their artificial nature, however, and the small numbers of study participants have typically been healthy.\nWe explored the effects of roadside traffic exposure on people with mild or moderate asthma, of differing severity, on a busy city street where traffic is entirely diesel-powered. We tested the hypothesis that short-term, ambient exposures to diesel traffic would lead to a reduction in lung function and a worsening of symptoms, accompanied by increased inflammation in the lungs.\nMethods\nParticipants\nUsing advertising and volunteer databases, we recruited 60 adults with asthma, none of whom were smokers; 31 had mild asthma and 29 had moderate asthma, as defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma. 12 Each participant had intermittent wheezing and airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine; the concentration of methacholine required to provoke a 20% decrease (PC20) in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was <8 mg per milliliter. The participants were studied during periods of asthmatic stability, defined by the absence of exacerbations, respiratory infections, and treatment with oral corticosteroids for 4 weeks or more. During the study, the participants took their usual asthma medications.\nThe project was approved by the ethics committee at Brompton Hospital, London, and the institutional review board at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, New Jersey. Written informed consent was provided by all participants.\nStudy Design\nIn this randomized, crossover study, participants walked for 2 hours (10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.) along the western end of Oxford Street, London's busiest shopping street, where only diesel-powered buses and taxicabs are permitted, or through the traffic-free, western part of the nearby 142-hectare (about 350-acre) Hyde Park. Participants walked about 6 km during each exposure, at a steady pace on predefined paths, resting for 15 minutes every half hour. Exposure sessions, separated by more than 3 weeks, were confined to weekdays between November and March (2003 to 2005) to avoid pollen seasons; rainy days were also avoided. Equal numbers of participants were randomly assigned to each exposure sequence. The study had an estimated 90% power to detect a minimum difference in FEV1 response of 5.7% in each asthma-severity group between the two sites.\nClinical Measurements\nParticipants measured their peak expiratory flow on a mini–Wright meter and recorded asthma symptoms 1 week before and after each exposure session; during the week before each exposure, they wore a diffusion tube to measure individual exposure to nitrogen dioxide throughout the week. At Royal Brompton Hospital, baseline measurements of FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow at 25 to 75% of vital capacity (FEF25–75) were performed with the use of a spirometer (Vitalograph); the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) was recorded with the use of a chemiluminescence analyzer (Aerocrine). Exhaled breath condensate from tidal breathing was obtained with the use of a standardized breath-condensate collector (ECoScreen, Jaeger), and its pH was measured after de-aeration with argon.\nParticipants were driven for approximately 10 minutes to the exposure sites in a gasoline-powered car. On arrival and hourly during each session, we made further spirometric measurements; on completion of each session, we asked participants to record any asthmatic symptoms. After returning to the hospital, we repeated spirometric and FeNO measurements regularly for 5 hours and measured responsiveness to methacholine; participants recorded any asthma symptoms over the ensuing 12 hours. The next morning, we repeated measurements of lung function and FeNO and collected samples of sputum induced by inhalation of a 3% sodium chloride solution from an ultrasonic nebulizer. Total cell counts were performed on a homogenized sputum sample with the use of 0.1% dithiothreitol, and differential cell counts were performed on 400 nonsquamous cells on cytospin slides. Supernatants were kept at −80°C for analysis of interleukin-8, myeloperoxidase, and eosinophil cationic protein with the use of commercially available immunoassay kits (IL-8 DuoSet, R&D Systems; and TiterZyme and UniCAP, Pharmacia Diagnostics AB; respectively).\nExposure Measurements\nThroughout each exposure session, we measured number concentrations of ultrafine particles, using a real-time condensation particle counter (Model 3007, TSI) equipped with a ribbon laser light-scattering optical system (range, 0 to 100,000 particles per cubic centimeter; accuracy, ±20%). We collected fine particles smaller than 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) on quartz-fiber filters, using an air sampler (16 liters per minute). The filters were used first to determine PM2.5 mass concentration gravimetrically and were then analyzed for elemental carbon according to National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health guidelines (method 5040) (Sunset Laboratory). With a sampling pump, we collected nitrogen dioxide on C18 Sep-Pak cartridges coated with potassium hydroxide and triethanolamine and subsequently analyzed the sample using ion chromatography. 13 Temperature and relative humidity sensors, along with all air monitors, were located on a pushcart beside the participants.\nStatistical Analysis\nDescriptive summaries of exposure and health outcomes included means (±SD) for normally distributed variables and medians with ranges for other variables. Correlations between pollutants were examined.\nAssociations between exposure and health outcomes were examined through comparative analysis (Oxford Street vs. Hyde Park) and pollutant-specific, exposure-response analyses. A repeated-measures, mixed-effects linear regression model was constructed to estimate average values for health outcomes, with the use of an interaction term for the categorical variables of site and time to examine the effect of the exposure site on changes in lung-function or inflammatory biomarkers. 14 A random effect for individual participants accounted for similarities across sessions for each person. A spatial-power covariance structure was used to model correlations between the unequally spaced repeated measurements within each session with a decay in the strength of correlation, depending on the time between measurements. With the use of the Akaike information criterion, this structure proved to model the data adequately relative to an unstructured correlation matrix. Additional covariates, including temperature and relative humidity and, where necessary, age, sex, body-mass index, and race or ethnic group were entered as covariates. Type 3 F tests of the site–time interaction produced P values representing the overall significance of the effect of site on changes in responses over time; contrasts of means were used to examine differences between sites in changes from baseline to particular time points. To study potential effect modifiers, we tested interactions between them and site–time interaction and conducted stratified analyses.\nBecause pollutant concentrations varied within and between sites, we performed pollutant-specific, exposure-response analyses using mixed models, as described above. In these models, we regressed the percent change from baseline in each of the lung-function and inflammatory-biomarker variables against pollutant concentrations averaged over each exposure session. Separate, single-pollutant models for PM2.5, elemental carbon, ultrafine particles, and nitrogen dioxide were generated. Subsequently, we used two-pollutant models, in which two of the four pollutants were analyzed simultaneously.\nResults\nTable 1.\nTable 1. Baseline Characteristics of the Study Participants.\nAs anticipated, participants with mild asthma had a higher baseline FEV1 than those with moderate asthma. They were also less likely to report limited exercise tolerance or symptoms provoked by exercise or traffic fumes ( Table 1 ).\nTable 2.\nTable 2. Exposure Measurements for Oxford Street and Hyde Park and Lung Function before Exposure.\nMedian weekly nitrogen dioxide exposures were not significantly different before exposure at the two sites ( Table 2 ). Participants had significantly higher exposures to PM2.5, ultrafine particles, elemental carbon, and nitrogen dioxide on Oxford Street than in Hyde Park. Spearman's rank-correlation coefficients for exposures to the four pollutants were as follows: 0.58 for the correlation of nitrogen dioxide with both ultrafine particles and elemental carbon, 0.62 for the correlation of PM2.5 with ultrafine particles, and 0.84 for the correlation of ultrafine particles with elemental carbon. (Complete information is provided in Table A1 of the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org.)\nAverage daily peak expiratory flow, symptoms, and use of asthma medication did not differ significantly in the week before exposures at the two sites. Similarly, there were no significant differences between the sites in mean FEV1, FVC, or FEF25–75 at baseline in the hospital or on arrival at the site ( Table 2 ). On the whole, changes over time in mean FEV1 and FVC differed significantly between the sites (P=0.04 and P=0.01, respectively), but there were no significant differences between sites in the changes in FEF25–75. Mean FEV1 (percent of the predicted value) was lower after 1 hour of exposure at both sites. The subsequent decrement was greater and more sustained for Oxford Street, with a maximal decline at 2 hours (−6.1%, vs. −1.9% for Hyde Park; P<0.001). The differences between sites remained significant at every time point (P<0.05) until 22 hours after exposure. Among participants with moderate asthma, the decline in FEV1 was greater for Oxford Street than for Hyde Park, but the difference was not significant.\nFigure 1.\nFigure 1. Mean Percent Changes in FEV1and FVC during and after Exposure on Oxford Street and in Hyde Park.\nPercent changes from initial values in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) are shown for all the study participants (Panels A and B, respectively), those with mild asthma (Panels C and D, respectively), and those with moderate asthma (Panels E and F, respectively). Asterisks denote P<0.05 for the difference in values between Oxford Street and Hyde Park exposures. I bars represent 95% CI.\nThe pattern for mean FVC (percent of predicted value) was similar ( Figure 1 ), with a maximum drop after 2 hours (−5.4% for Oxford Street vs. −1.6% for Hyde Park, P<0.005). The differences in changes in FVC between the two sites were significant at each time point between 2 and 5 hours after the start of exposure (P<0.05) and were significantly greater among participants with moderate asthma than among those with mild asthma (P=0.008). There were no significant differences in the mean change in FEF25–75 (percent of predicted value) between sites or in the methacholine PC20 value 5 hours after exposure.\nChanges in respiratory symptoms during and after exposures were small. Participants with mild asthma reported more symptoms after exposures on Oxford Street (both immediately afterward and 5 hours afterward) than after exposures in Hyde Park, but the differences were not significant. The use of treatments for asthma relief over the 7-day period after exposure did not differ significantly between the two sites.\nFigure 2.\nFigure 2. Mean Changes in Exhaled Breath Condensate pH, Sputum Neutrophil Counts, Supernatant Interleukin-8, and Supernatant Myeloperoxidase before and after Exposure on Oxford Street and in Hyde Park.\nChanges in exhaled breath condensate pH are shown in Panel A for all participants, in Panel B for those with mild asthma, and in Panel C for those with moderate asthma. Changes in sputum neutrophil counts, supernatant interleukin-8, and supernatant myeloperoxidase are shown in Panels D, E, and F, respectively, for all subjects. With the use of mixed-effect models to test for overall changes in exhaled breath condensate pH over time, P=0.01 for all participants, P=0.27 for participants with mild asthma, and P=0.02 for participants with moderate asthma. T bars represent 95% CI.\nThere were no significant differences in the changes in mean FeNO between exposures on Oxford Street and those in Hyde Park. There were greater decreases in the pH of exhaled breath condensate after exposure on Oxford Street — 1.16%, as compared with 0.88% in Hyde Park at 3 hours, and −1.90% as compared with 0.04% in Hyde Park at 6 hours ( Figure 2 ). The changes were not significantly greater among participants with moderate asthma.\nThe sputum myeloperoxidase concentration at 24 hours was higher after exposure on Oxford Street (24.5 ng per milliliter) than after exposure in Hyde Park (4.2 ng per milliliter, P=0.01) ( Figure 2 ). Sputum neutrophil counts and interleukin-8 concentrations were strongly correlated with myeloperoxidase (P<0.001 for both comparisons), and each was higher after Oxford Street exposures; only in the case of sputum neutrophil counts (for all participants), however, was this difference significant. There were no significant differences in sputum eosinophil counts or eosinophil cationic protein levels. We found no consistent evidence of an interaction between these health outcomes and the other variables listed in Table 1 (and Table A2 in the Supplementary Appendix ).\nFigure 3.\nFigure 3. Point Estimates and 95% CI of the Percent Change in Health End Points per Incremental Change in Pollutant Components.\nChanges in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of vital capacity (FEF25–75), and the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) are shown according to incremental changes in the levels of ultrafine particles (Panel A), fine particles (Panel B), elemental carbon (Panel C), and nitrogen dioxide (Panel D).\nReductions in FEV1, FVC, FEF25–75, and exhaled breath condensate pH were associated with ultrafine-particle exposures at most time points ( Figure 3 ); these reductions were also associated, although less consistently, with elemental carbon exposures (for ultrafine particles, P=0.02, P=0.27, P=0.11, and P=0.03, respectively; for elemental carbon, P=0.04, P=0.11, P=0.32, and P=0.24, respectively). Elemental carbon exposures were also associated with increases in FeNO concentrations (P=0.06). For nitrogen dioxide, the associations were similar but less pronounced; for PM2.5, there were no consistent associations. Increased sputum myeloperoxidase concentrations were associated with ultrafine-particle exposure (P=0.03). There were no associations between sputum cell counts or interleukin-8 and any of the pollutant constituents. After adjustment for copollutants in the two-pollutant models, the effects of ultrafine particles and elemental carbon remained the most consistent and were significant (Table A3 in the Supplementary Appendix ).\nDiscussion\nWe examined the functional and inflammatory effects on asthma of real-life exposure to roadside diesel traffic. In adults with asthma, walking for 2 hours at a leisurely pace along a street where only diesel-powered vehicles were permitted resulted in a significant but essentially asymptomatic reduction in lung function. Although the changes were small, they were greater than those provoked by walking in a nearby park and were more pronounced among study participants whose asthma was more severe. These changes were accompanied by inflammatory changes in sputum and exhaled breath condensate.\nThe inflammatory response was predominantly neutrophilic, with raised levels of myeloperoxidase and interleukin-8 in sputum supernatants; we did not detect, even in participants with more severe asthma, an eosinophilic response characteristic of asthmatic inflammation. In association with the drop in FEV1, we found a twofold increase in exhaled-breath-condensate hydrogen ions after exposure on Oxford Street. Acute asthma may be accompanied by airway acidification, with an increase in hydrogen ions by a factor of more than 100, 15 perhaps reflecting inhibition of local epithelial proton pumps during airway inflammation. 16 Thus, intracellular acidosis related to the inflammatory process may be reflected in reduced airway pH. 17\nIt has been suggested that any harmful respiratory effects of acute exposure to diesel exhaust are attributable more to its particulate content than to its gaseous content. 18 In addition to coarse particles (2.5 to 10 μm in diameter), diesel exhaust contains, in far greater numbers, ultrafine particles (<0.1 μm in diameter). In our study, the most consistent relationships between changes in respiratory variables and specific pollutant concentrations were for ultrafine particles and elemental carbon, a finding consistent with growing evidence that the adverse respiratory effects of diesel-generated particles are attributable to those in the very small size range. 19-23 With their higher ratio of surface area to mass, ultrafine particles can adsorb greater fractions of potentially toxic substances onto their surface, and they are deposited more deeply and in greater numbers within the lung than are larger particles. Furthermore, the carbon core of elemental carbon particles is highly adsorptive. 24 Differences in the concentrations of ultrafine particles and elemental carbon between Oxford Street and Hyde Park were substantially larger than the differences in concentration between PM2.5 and particles less than 10 μm in diameter. However, our findings cannot be taken as a demonstration of a causal association with ultrafine particles and elemental carbon, since these may simply be a sensitive proxy for the entirety of a roadside diesel-traffic exposure, which is composed not only of the complex diesel exhaust mixture but also of resuspended coarse, thoracic particles (small enough to enter the thorax) from road dust and engine or tire debris, which we did not measure.\nPrevious studies of the direct effects of diesel exhaust on asthma in humans have been conducted under laboratory conditions, with fresh diesel fumes, from which gaseous constituents may have been removed (“scrubbed”), or reconstituted diesel exhaust material delivered to subjects in an exposure chamber. 6,7,11,25-27 The findings of these studies have not been entirely consistent, and none of them have demonstrated an effect on spirometric lung function, despite the use of much higher concentrations of diesel particles than those we measured on Oxford Street. The discrepancies between the findings of other studies and our own may be due to the complexity of the natural pollutant mixture we studied, with interactions between particulates and other pollutants, or to the possibility that reconstituted or scrubbed diesel exhaust mixtures substantially reduce the proportion of ultrafine particles. In addition, we studied people with more severe asthma. Svartengren et al., 28 in a realistic study of brief exposure to traffic pollution in a road tunnel, also failed to find any effect on FEV1 but reported more symptoms than we observed. Personal exposures to PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide were much higher in that study, but the study participants had milder asthma than did the participants in our study. On the other hand, the inflammatory responses we observed, particularly the increase in sputum neutrophils and myeloperoxidase, were similar in nature to those in studies of controlled, chamber exposures. 8,10,26,28\nOur primary motive was to understand the effects of typical exposures to an urban atmosphere dominated by diesel exhaust. To this end, we selected a setting where only diesel traffic was allowed and used a randomized, crossover design limited to the winter months to avoid confounding exposure to pollens, thereby removing or controlling for most important confounding factors. Nonetheless, we recognize some limitations of our study, including the impossibility of blinding participants and the inability to exclude the possibility of subjective responses, particularly with symptom reporting. However, the internal consistency of our findings and the changes in variables over which the participants had no control make it very improbable that our results arose entirely from a subjective bias. Another difficulty arises from potentially confounding exposures that we did not measure. For example, a walk on Oxford Street is likely to be a more stressful experience than a walk in a quiet park, and it is possible that some of the responses we measured were induced by factors associated with stress, particularly noise. 29 In addition, because we did not study a reference group of people without asthma, we cannot be sure that our findings are specific to people with asthma, although the more pronounced responses in the participants with more severe disease suggest that the findings are specific. Finally, we did not study exposure to gasoline-powered traffic and therefore cannot conclude that diesel traffic is more toxic than other types.\nOur observations serve as a direct demonstration and explanation of the epidemiologic evidence that associates exposure to diesel traffic with the severity of asthma and of the symptoms that many patients with asthma report after exposure to diesel exhaust. The changes in our primary end point (FEV1) were small and unaccompanied by clinically significant symptoms but would be more important in patients with more compromised lung function. Without further study, however, we do not believe that these findings should deter most patients with asthma from visiting or working in busy urban environments. Our design has considerable advantages over orthodox chamber studies and could readily be adapted to assess therapeutic strategies in the prophylaxis of traffic responses in asthma or other cardiorespiratory diseases.\nFunding and Disclosures\nSupported by the Health Effects Institute through a Research Agreement (02-9) with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.\nDr. Cullinan reports serving as a member of the Expert Advisory Panel for Air Quality Standards for the U.K. government.

These two scheduling problems are commonly formulated with non-smooth cost functions respectively considering various effects and constraints, such as the valve point effect, power balance and ramp rate limits. The expected increase in plug-in electric vehicles is likely to see a significant impact on the power system due to high charging power consumption and significant uncertainty in charging times. In this paper, multiple electric vehicle charging profiles are comparatively integrated into a 24-hour load demand in an economic and environment dispatch model. Self-learning teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO) is employed to solve the non-convex non-linear dispatch problems. Numerical results on well-known benchmark functions, as well as test systems with different scales of generation units show the significance of the new scheduling method.\nDocuments\nA self-learning TLBO based dynamic economic/environmental dispatch considering multiple plug-in electric vehicle loads\nRights statement: Copyright The Author(s) 2014.

Boyle, M.D.\net al.,\nfor the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT Study Groups *\nA complete list of the investigators in the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT studies is provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.\nAbstract\nBackground\nCystic fibrosis is a life-limiting disease that is caused by defective or deficient cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein activity. Phe508del is the most common CFTR mutation.\nMethods\nWe conducted two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that were designed to assess the effects of lumacaftor (VX-809), a CFTR corrector, in combination with ivacaftor (VX-770), a CFTR potentiator, in patients 12 years of age or older who had cystic fibrosis and were homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation. In both studies, patients were randomly assigned to receive either lumacaftor (600 mg once daily or 400 mg every 12 hours) in combination with ivacaftor (250 mg every 12 hours) or matched placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was the absolute change from baseline in the percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at week 24.\nResults\nA total of 1108 patients underwent randomization and received study drug. The mean baseline FEV1 was 61% of the predicted value. In both studies, there were significant improvements in the primary end point in both lumacaftor–ivacaftor dose groups; the difference between active treatment and placebo with respect to the mean absolute improvement in the percentage of predicted FEV1 ranged from 2.6 to 4.0 percentage points (P<0.001), which corresponded to a mean relative treatment difference of 4.3 to 6.7% (P<0.001). Pooled analyses showed that the rate of pulmonary exacerbations was 30 to 39% lower in the lumacaftor–ivacaftor groups than in the placebo group; the rate of events leading to hospitalization or the use of intravenous antibiotics was lower in the lumacaftor–ivacaftor groups as well. The incidence of adverse events was generally similar in the lumacaftor–ivacaftor and placebo groups. The rate of discontinuation due to an adverse event was 4.2% among patients who received lumacaftor–ivacaftor versus 1.6% among those who received placebo.\nConclusions\nThese data show that lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor provided a benefit for patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation. (Funded by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and others; TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT01807923 and NCT01807949 .)\nIntroduction\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that is associated with high rates of premature death. 1-4 It is a multisystem disease that is characterized by pancreatic insufficiency and chronic airway infections associated with loss of lung function, repeated pulmonary exacerbations, and, ultimately, respiratory failure. 5\nCystic fibrosis is caused by gene mutations that result in deficient or dysfunctional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, an anion channel that is normally present in the epithelial membrane. Phe508del (c.1521_1523delCTT; formerly F508del) is the most common CFTR mutation; approximately 45% of patients with cystic fibrosis are homozygous for this allele. 1 Cystic fibrosis is a progressive disease; despite advances in therapies designed to address the symptoms of the disease, the median predicted survival among patients who are homozygous for Phe508del in the United States is 37 years. 6 The Phe508del CFTR mutation causes a processing defect that severely reduces protein levels at the epithelial membrane; for the few channels that reach the cell surface, the mutation also disrupts channel opening; together, these effects lead to minimal CFTR chloride transport activity. 7-10 One approach to treating cystic fibrosis is to address the underlying cause of the disease by targeting the CFTR protein dysfunction. Restoring chloride transport to p.Phe508del CFTR (formerly F508del CFTR) is therefore thought to require at least two steps: correction of cellular misprocessing to increase the amount of functional mutated CFTR and potentiation to further increase channel opening.\nLumacaftor is an investigational CFTR corrector that has been shown in vitro to correct p.Phe508del CFTR misprocessing and increase the amount of cell surface–localized protein. 11 Ivacaftor is an approved CFTR potentiator that increases the open probability of CFTR channels (i.e., the fraction of time that the channels are open) in vitro and improves clinical outcomes in patients 6 years of age or older who have cystic fibrosis and at least one copy of most class III (gating) mutations. 12-17 In vitro studies have shown that ivacaftor also potentiates surface-localized p.Phe508del CFTR, 18 and the combination of lumacaftor with ivacaftor has been associated with a greater increase in chloride transport than has either agent alone. 11\nAlthough neither ivacaftor nor lumacaftor monotherapy has been shown to have meaningful clinical efficacy in patients who are homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation, 19,20 a phase 2 study suggested that the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor increased CFTR activity to a degree that may be sufficient to improve clinical outcomes in these patients. 21 Therefore, two phase 3 trials (TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT) were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different doses of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in patients with cystic fibrosis who were homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Oversight\nThe TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT trials were two phase 3, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies in which lumacaftor (VX-809, Vertex Pharmaceuticals) was orally administered in combination with ivacaftor (VX-770, Vertex Pharmaceuticals) for 24 weeks; the studies were conducted from April 2013 through April 2014. The study design and methods of data analysis were identical for the two studies, with the exception of the inclusion of ambulatory electrocardiography (TRAFFIC only) and adolescent pharmacokinetic assessments (TRANSPORT only) for a subgroup of patients. The studies were designed to evaluate the efficacy of lumacaftor–ivacaftor in patients with cystic fibrosis who were homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation; the evaluation of safety was a secondary objective. The protocols (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) were reviewed and approved by an ethics committee at each of the 187 participating centers; all patients provided written informed consent.\nPatients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1 ratio) to one of three study groups (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org): 600 mg of lumacaftor once daily in combination with 250 mg of ivacaftor every 12 hours (LUM [600 mg/day]–IVA), 400 mg of lumacaftor every 12 hours in combination with 250 mg of ivacaftor every 12 hours (LUM [400 mg every 12 hr]–IVA), or lumacaftor-matched placebo every 12 hours in combination with ivacaftor-matched placebo every 12 hours. All regimens were given for 24 weeks. Randomization was stratified according to age (<18 years vs. ≥18 years), sex, and pulmonary function (percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] at screening, <70 vs. ≥70).\nThe sponsor of the studies (Vertex Pharmaceuticals) designed the protocol in collaboration with the authors. Site investigators collected the data, which were analyzed by the sponsor. All the authors had full access to the study data after the study periods were complete and the data were unblinded. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of this report to the study protocols , which are available at NEJM.org.\nStudy Participants\nEligibility criteria included a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, homozygosity for the Phe508del CFTR mutation, an age of 12 years or older, a percentage of predicted FEV1 at the time of screening that was 40 to 90% of the predicted normal values, 22,23 and stable cystic fibrosis disease. Between the screening and baseline visits (≤4 weeks), fluctuation in FEV1 occurred in some cases and was documented; 81 patients had an FEV1 that fell to below 40% of the predicted value at baseline. Patients continued to take their prestudy medications.\nStudy Assessments\nAll assessments were prespecified in the study protocols and statistical analysis plans unless otherwise noted. The primary end point was the absolute change from baseline at week 24 in the percentage of predicted FEV1, calculated by averaging the mean absolute change at week 16 and the mean absolute change at week 24; this approach was used because we anticipated that it would reduce variability, as compared with using the point estimate at week 24 alone. Key secondary end points included the relative change from baseline in the percentage of predicted FEV1 (calculated by averaging the mean values for weeks 16 and 24), the absolute change from baseline at week 24 in body-mass index (BMI), the absolute change from baseline at week 24 in the patient-reported Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire–Revised (CFQ-R) respiratory domain score (scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a higher patient-reported quality of life with regard to respiratory status), 24 the percentage of patients with a relative increase from baseline of 5% or higher in the percentage of predicted FEV1 (calculated by averaging the mean values for weeks 16 and 24), and the number of pulmonary exacerbations through week 24. The time to the first pulmonary exacerbation was assessed, as was the absolute change in body weight. The safety of the study regimens was also evaluated. Subgroup analyses and additional assessments of exacerbation, including assessments of the numbers of patients requiring hospitalization and those requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics, were also performed.\nStatistical Analyses\nAll patients who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of study drug were included in the efficacy analysis, in which patients were analyzed as part of the study group to which they were randomly assigned (full analysis set). In the primary analysis, we evaluated the treatment difference in the percentage of predicted FEV1 at week 24, which was assessed as the difference between the treatment groups and the placebo group in the primary end point.\nThe safety set included all patients who received any amount of study drug; data were analyzed according to the patients’ actual study group (regardless of the group to which they had been randomly assigned). The reported adverse events are those that either developed or increased in severity at or after the time patients received the initial dose of study drug, up to 28 days after receipt of the last dose. Additional details regarding the statistical analysis, including the hierarchical testing procedure for the multiple end points and the criteria for the assessment of statistical significance, are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\nResults\nTable 3.\nTable 3. Adverse Events Associated with the Study Regimens.\nOverall, the proportion of patients reporting adverse events was similar across the lumacaftor–ivacaftor groups and the placebo group ( Table 3 ). Pooled across the studies, serious adverse events were reported in 28.6% of the patients in the placebo group and in 17.3 to 22.8% of the patients in the lumacaftor–ivacaftor groups. In all the groups, infective pulmonary exacerbation was the most common serious adverse event (occurring in 24.1% of the patients in the placebo group and in 13.0% of those in the pooled lumacaftor–ivacaftor groups). The proportion of patients who discontinued the study regimen because of an adverse event was higher in the lumacaftor–ivacaftor groups than in the placebo group (4.2% [31 of 738 patients] vs. 1.6% [6 of 370 patients]). Among the patients receiving lumacaftor–ivacaftor, the adverse events that led to discontinuation of the study regimen in two or more patients were elevation of the creatine kinase level (4 patients), hemoptysis (3), bronchospasm (2), dyspnea (2), pulmonary exacerbation (2), and rash (2). No deaths were reported.\nThe adverse events reported more frequently in the lumacaftor–ivacaftor groups were generally respiratory in nature. The majority were of mild-to-moderate severity and included dyspnea and chest tightness ( Table 3 , and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Two patients in the placebo group (one with dyspnea and one with chest discomfort) and four patients in the LUM (600 mg/day)–IVA group (two with dyspnea and two with bronchospasm) had adverse events of respiratory symptoms or reactive airways that were severe. In patients who had respiratory-symptom adverse events within 1 to 2 days after the initiation of therapy and who did not discontinue the study regimen, the events generally resolved within the first 2 to 3 weeks of therapy. Beyond the first week of therapy, the incidence of respiratory events was similar in the lumacaftor–ivacaftor and placebo groups. In addition, the pattern of adverse events according to the severity of lung disease at baseline was generally similar across the groups.\nElevations in levels of alanine or aspartate aminotransferase to more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range were observed in 5.1% of the patients in the placebo group and in 5.2% of those in the lumacaftor–ivacaftor groups (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Serious adverse events related to abnormal liver function were not observed in the placebo group and were reported for seven patients in the lumacaftor–ivacaftor groups. After discontinuation or interruption of lumacaftor–ivacaftor therapy, liver function in all patients improved substantially, and results of liver-function tests returned to baseline in the case of six patients. Details regarding these events, including concomitant elevations in bilirubin, are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\nDiscussion\nSignificant improvements in the percentage of predicted FEV1 were seen in all four lumacaftor–ivacaftor treatment groups in the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT studies. In both dose groups in each study, improvements in FEV1 were seen by day 15 and were sustained throughout the 24-week study period.\nLumacaftor–ivacaftor combination therapy resulted in improvements in multiple clinical end points, and the findings were generally consistent across dose groups and studies. Clinically important reductions in the rate of pulmonary exacerbations were also observed in association with lumacaftor–ivacaftor therapy. Through 24 weeks, the lumacaftor–ivacaftor groups had reductions in the rate of pulmonary exacerbations, with decreases in the numbers of events leading to hospitalization or intravenous antibiotic treatment. FEV1 and rates of pulmonary exacerbations are strong predictors of survival and thus remain important for the evaluation of new therapies for cystic fibrosis. 25\nSignificant improvements (i.e., increases) in BMI were observed in the TRANSPORT study and in the pooled analyses but not in the TRAFFIC study. Across both studies, BMI continued to increase during the study period in both lumacaftor–ivacaftor groups. Although the mechanisms for improvement in the nutritional status of patients with cystic fibrosis are not fully defined, the gains are hypothesized to reflect either better caloric absorption, possibly due to normalized intestinal pH, 17 or a reduction in energy expenditure resulting from amelioration of lung disease. 17,26 Numerical increases in the CFQ-R respiratory domain score favoring active treatment were seen in both dose groups in both studies; however, in the pooled analysis of that score, the treatment difference was significant only in the LUM (600 mg/day)–IVA group and did not meet the requirement for a minimum clinically important difference (4 points). 24 It is challenging to interpret these results, given the significant improvements in FEV1. The CFQ-R instrument is valuable for assessing patient-reported outcomes; however, there is precedent for a lack of correlation with FEV1. Studies of tobramycin showed no correlation between changes in CFQ-R and FEV1. 24 It is also worth noting that the CFQ-R minimum clinically important difference was established as a within-group change in patients who had markers of advanced disease, which complicates its application to other populations. 24\nThe TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT study cohorts were a population with well-managed cystic fibrosis, as evidenced by the minimal FEV1 deterioration in the placebo group and the high rates of the use of standard cystic fibrosis therapy. The magnitude of the change in FEV1 was significant and was in the range of the magnitudes of change seen in studies of other cystic fibrosis therapeutics. 27-31 The changes due to treatment in the percentage of predicted FEV1 were largely consistent across studies, dose groups, and all subgroups analyzed, including subgroups defined according to age, baseline FEV1 (<40 vs. ≥40), and status with respect to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Improvements in FEV1 and BMI and reductions in exacerbations were observed while patients continued to use their prescribed cystic fibrosis therapies; lumacaftor–ivacaftor is therefore expected to provide a clinically meaningful benefit in addition to the standard of care. The determination of the potential for lumacaftor–ivacaftor–mediated CFTR modulation to modify the course of disease will require additional analyses and longer-term data.\nAlthough the improvements in FEV1 associated with lumacaftor–ivacaftor were significant and consistent with in vitro 11 and phase 2 sweat chloride and FEV1 results, 21 the effect of lumacaftor–ivacaftor on sweat chloride and FEV1 was smaller than that observed in patients with the Gly551Asp mutation who were treated with ivacaftor monotherapy. 13,14 Whereas CFTR with the p.Gly551Asp mutation has a gating defect but is found at the cell surface, CFTR with the p.Phe508del mutation has multiple defects, which makes addressing the underlying cause of disease in patients homozygous for this mutation more complex. The most important of these defects is a substantial reduction in processing and transport to the cell surface, plus a reduced stability and channel gating of the few surface-localized proteins. These multiple defects make restoring p.Phe508del CFTR activity and subsequent observation of a clinical benefit more challenging than addressing the p.Gly551Asp gating defect. The smaller changes in sweat chloride and FEV1 seen in association with lumacaftor–ivacaftor therapy in patients homozygous for Phe508del, as compared with the changes seen in association with ivacaftor monotherapy in patients with Gly551Asp, was predicted in vitro and may be due in part to the fact that lumacaftor only partially rescues the p.Phe508del CFTR processing defect, 11 which results in fewer p.Phe508del CFTR channels at the cell surface than are seen with p.Gly551Asp CFTR.\nTwo in vitro studies have suggested that treatment (for ≤48 hours) with potentiators, including ivacaftor, may reduce the stability and expression of corrected p.Phe508del. 32,33 Although it is possible that ivacaftor affects the steady-state levels of corrected p.Phe508del CFTR in vitro, the results of the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT studies, which included more than 1100 patients, suggest that lumacaftor–ivacaftor provides a clinical benefit that is greater than that previously observed with either agent alone. 20,21 Moreover, the clinical benefit was sustained for the entire duration of the studies. Nevertheless, the differences between the results of treatment with lumacaftor–ivacaftor in patients with the Phe508del mutation and treatment with ivacaftor in patients with the Gly551Asp mutation point to the need for continued development of CFTR modulators that will further improve on the meaningful FEV1 benefits observed in the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT studies.\nLumacaftor–ivacaftor therapy at both dosing regimens generally had an acceptable side-effect profile. The proportion of patients who discontinued the study regimen for reasons related to an adverse event was higher among those who received lumacaftor–ivacaftor than among those who received placebo, and dyspnea and chest tightness were reported more frequently in the active-treatment groups. In a phase 2 study, treatment with lumacaftor monotherapy was associated with an initial increased risk of dyspnea or chest tightness, although these symptoms were uncommon after the addition of ivacaftor to lumacaftor. 21 Elevated levels of liver enzymes were observed in a similar number of patients in the active-treatment groups and the placebo group; however, serious adverse events related to elevation of liver enzymes were reported only in the active-treatment group.\nThe TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT studies included the same two doses of lumacaftor so that we could ascertain whether there was a dose response for the CFTR corrector. Pooled across the two studies, the dose regimens appeared to have similar efficacy and safety profiles, with no clear differentiation except with respect to pulmonary exacerbation–related outcomes, which consistently favored the LUM (400 mg every 12 hr)–IVA group.\nIn conclusion, in the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT studies, lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor improved FEV1 and reduced the rate of pulmonary exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis who were homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation. Lumacaftor–ivacaftor therapy generally had an acceptable side-effect profile, with more than 93% of patients completing the assigned therapy regimen. These data show that the combination of a CFTR corrector and potentiator, designed to address the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis by targeting CFTR, can benefit patients who are homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation and represents a treatment milestone for the 45% of patients with cystic fibrosis who are homozygous for this mutation.\nFunding and Disclosures\nSupported by Vertex Pharmaceuticals; a program grant from the Children’s Hospital Foundation, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia (to Dr. Wainwright); the Northern Ireland Clinical Research Network (Respiratory Health) in Belfast Health and Social Care Trust (to Dr. Elborn); grants from the Institute of Translational Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health (NIH) (UL1TR000423) and the Cystic Fibrosis Translational Research Center, NIH (P30DK089507, both to Dr. Ramsey); the National Institute for Health Research Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit at the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust and Imperial College London (to Dr. Davies); the South Carolina Clinical and Translational Research Institute, Medical University of South Carolina (UL1TR000062 to Dr. Flume); the Clinical and Translational Science Collaborative of Cleveland (UL1TR000439), a grant from the Cystic Fibrosis Core Center (DK027651), and a grant from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Development Network to Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine (all to Dr. Konstan); grants from the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (UL1RR025741) and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Development Network (MCCOLL14YO) (both to Dr. McColley); grants from the UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science (UL1TR000165), the UAB Cystic Fibrosis Research Center (DK072482), and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (all to Dr. Rowe); and the Johns Hopkins Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, which is funded in part by a grant from the NIH (UL1TR001079, to Dr. Boyle).\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nDr. Wainwright reports receiving consulting fees from Medscape and Vertex, lecture fees and travel support from Vertex and Novartis, grant support from Vertex, GlaxoSmithKline, and Novo Nordisk, and fees on a per patient basis as principal investigator of a clinical study from Boehringer Ingelheim.

To lower the investment in the off-board charging station facilities, a multi-functional switched reluctance motor topology is proposed on the basis of the traditional asymmetrical half-bridge converter. The SRM phase windings are employed as input filter inductors and centre-tapped windings are also developed to form symmetrical inductors for three-phase grid supply. Owing to the varying rotor position, phase inductors are unequal between one another. A hysteresis control scheme is therefore developed for grid-connection operation. In addition to AC supplies, the proposed topology can also supports the DC-source charging. A new current sharing strategy is employed to diminish the influence of the unequal winding inductances. The simulation and experimental tests are carried out to verify the proposed topology and control methods. Since this work eliminates the need for building charging station infrastructure, its potential economic impact on the automotive market can be significant.\n""","10.282589","""https://research.aston.ac.uk/portal/en/researchoutput/windingcentretapped-switched-reluctance-motor-drive-for-multisource-charging-in-electric-vehicle-applications(b239fa81-1834-4d44-801a-f5aa0c868f56).html""","[-1.888803,52.487018]"

A questionnaire designed to evaluate older people's awareness of their sensory abilities with regard to road use was administered to 80 individuals aged from 50 to 79 years, who were also given eyesight and hearing tests. Despite marked declines in their objective sensory efficiency, people in their 70s did not rate their sensory abilities as poor any more than did people in their 50s. Individuals of any age who did subjectively perceive declines in their sensory abilities also reported that they had made very sensible adjustments in their road-use behaviour, for example, avoiding complex junctions. Those individuals who reported taking such precautions also reported fewer recent accidents. One month after completing the questionnaire, and being given the results of their eyesight and hearing tests, two-thirds of individuals reported that they had made important changes in their behaviour on the roads. Many now avoided or took particular care in dangerous situations, and some had started to wear prescribed spectacles more appropriately. The implications of older people's lack of awareness of changes in their sensory abilities to their safety on the roads, and in general, are discussed. Factors causing the age-related mismatch between actual and subjectively perceived sensory abilities are discussed.\nGeneral Accident Insurance Company.

However, the introduction of EVs poses major challenges for power system operation. With increasing penetration of EVs, uncontrolled coincident charging may overload the grid and substantially increase peak power requirements. Developing smart grid technologies and appropriate charging strategies to support the role out of EVs is therefore a high priority. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of distributed additive increase and multiplicative decrease (AIMD) charging algorithms, as proposed by Stu¨dli et al. in 2012, at mitigating the impact of domestic charging of EVs on low-voltage distribution networks. In particular, a number of enhancements to the basic AIMD implementation are introduced to enable local power system infrastructure and voltage level constraints to be taken into account and to reduce peak power requirements. The enhanced AIMD EV charging strategies are evaluated using power system simulations for a typical low-voltage residential feeder network in Ireland. Results show that by using the proposed AIMD-based smart charging algorithms, 50% EV penetration can be accommodated, compared with only 10% with uncontrolled charging, without exceeding network infrastructure constraints.\nDocuments\nRights statement: © 2013 The Authors\nAccepted author manuscript, 563 KB, PDF-document\nDOI\nResearch output: Chapter in Book/Report/Conference proceeding › Conference contribution\nFingerprint\nT: +44 (0)28 9024 5133\nEmergency T: +44 (0)28 9097 2222\n© Queen's University Belfast 2017,\n""","0.2025262","""http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/enhanced-aimd-based-decentralized-residential-charging-of-evs(cc48559a-c1c7-4001-879d-2a8527892757).html""","[-5.934759,54.583863]"

The control of the electric drive is based on an algebraic mapping of the accelerator pedal position, the battery state-of-charge (SOC), and the vehicle velocity into a motor controller input torque command. This mapping is developed using a sequential linearization control (SLC) methodology. The internal combustion engine (ICE) control uses a modified accelerator pedal to throttle plate angle using an adjustable gain parameter that, in turn, determines the sustained battery SOC. Searches over an admissible control space or the use of pre-defined look-up tables are thus avoided. Actual on-road results for a Ford Explorer with a through-the-road (TTR) hybrid powertrain using this control methodology are presented. In addition, Matlab-based simulation results for PHEVs and HEVs using this single control algorithm are presented employing a model of the Explorer. These results show the gasoline consumption and SOC over 48 repeated cycles of three common driving schedules.

This study explored a theoretical model of aggressive expression and crash-related outcomes using self-report data collected, using an online questionnaire, from drivers in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The proposed model tested whether the personality traits of boredom proneness, sensation seeking, and impulsivity, coupled with trait driving anger, predicted aggressive driving; and whether aggressive driving predicted crash-related outcomes (loss of concentration and control, near misses, and moving violations). The structural model was confirmed, with aggressive expressions of anger being found to mediate the relationships driving anger and impulsivity had with the crash-related outcomes. Multigroup invariance analysis showed that the model remained invariant across drivers from the United Kingdom and Ireland, suggesting that the contributing factors for aggressive expression and crash involvement are similar across both countries. When self-reported crash-related conditions were compared between drivers in the United Kingdom and Ireland, drivers in the United Kingdom reported more aggressive driving, more minor crashes, more incidents of road rage, and more frequent losses of concentration and vehicle control.\n""","0.017748872","""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/risa.12379/abstract?systemMessage=Please+be+advised+that+we+experienced+an+unexpected+issue+that+occurred+on+Saturday+and+Sunday+January+20th+and+21st+that+caused+the+site+to+be+down+for+an+extended+period+of+time+and+affected+the+ability+of+users+to+access+content+on+Wiley+Online+Library.+This+issue+has+now+been+fully+resolved.++We+apologize+for+any+inconvenience+this+may+have+caused+and+are+working+to+ensure+that+we+can+alert+you+immediately+of+any+unplanned+periods+of+downtime+or+disruption+in+the+future.""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

We examined whether externalizing and internalizing behaviors expressed in childhood predict injuries in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.\nMethods: The participants were from the 1958 British birth cohort (n = 11,537). Problem behaviors were assessed by teachers at ages 7 and 11. Injuries were reported by the participants’ parents (at ages 7, 11, 16) and by the participants (at ages 23, 33, 42, and 46). Data on injury severity were available at ages 23 and 33, and on types of injuries at ages 23, 33, and 42. Measures of childhood family environment included father’s social class, family size, and family difficulties. Adult psychological distress, treated as a potential mediating factor, was assessed at ages 23, 33, and 42.\nResults: Externalizing behavior predicted increased injury risk: one SD increase in externalizing score was associated with 10–19% increase in the rate of injuries in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. In contrast, internalizing behavior decreased injury rate by 3–9% in adolescence and adulthood. Externalizing behavior was associated with various types of injuries, including injuries in traffic, at home, at work, and from violent assaults, while internalizing behavior predicted decreased injury risk particularly in sports, in traffic, and at home. These associations were largely independent of childhood family environment and adult psychological distress.\nConclusions: The findings suggest that childhood problem behaviors predict injury risk over the life course from childhood to midlife, with externalizing behaviors increasing and internalizing behaviors decreasing this risk.\nManuscript accepted 15 April 2009\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Predicting the number of injuries at different ages by childhood problem behaviors and adult psychological distress.

Research into this area is generally classed as vehicle-to-grid research. In theory, the energy available from electric vehicles could be directly correlated to the vehicle's state of charge (SoC) and battery capacity during the time the car is parked and plugged in. However, not all the energy in the vehicle may be used, as some capacity is required by the driver for their next journey. As such, this paper uses data captured as part of a large scale electric vehicle trial to investigate the effect of three different types of driver routine on vehicle-to-grid availability. Each driver's behaviour is analysed to assess the energy that is available for STOR, with follow on journey requirements also considered.\nDocuments\nImpact of driver behaviour on availability of electric vehicle stored energy for STOR\nRights statement: © 2014 IEEE.

Experimental and observational studies point to a link between inflammatory processes and the development of atherosclerosis (i.e., atherogenesis) as one of the potential pathways ( Libby et al. 2002 ). The hypothesis that air pollution contributes to atherogenesis through vascular damage due to oxidative stress and systemic inflammation has been supported by animal models ( Araujo et al. 2008 ; Sun et al. 2005 ; Suwa et al. 2002 ).\nSeveral epidemiological studies have addressed this hypothesis using measurements of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). Cross-sectional measurements of CIMT are an established marker of preclinical stages of atherosclerosis ( Lorenz et al. 2012 ). CIMT is a particularly useful marker to investigate the atherogenic role of ambient air pollution, because it is not sensitive to short-term influences ( Künzli et al. 2011 ). Instead of the binary nature of cardiovascular events, CIMT describes the preclinical and clinical degree of the atherogenic state on a continuous scale. This is of relevance both from a biological perspective to investigate the etiology of the long-term process of atherogenesis and in the context of primary prevention.\nSo far, only three longitudinal studies ( Adar et al. 2013 ; Künzli et al. 2010 ; Wilker et al. 2013 ) in the United States have used CIMT measurements to test the hypothesis of an accelerated progression of CIMT among those with higher cumulative exposure to air pollution and have reported positive associations. These results suggest that chronic exposure to air pollution may accelerate injury to the vasculature. This may lead to a substantial shift in the age of the population at risk of suffering a cardiovascular outcome and may explain stronger associations of mortality based on long-term studies compared with time-series studies ( Künzli et al. 2011 ). A cross-sectional analysis in an adult population should reflect a differential atherogenic progression by an association between measured CIMT and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution.\nThe first cross-sectional study that tested this hypothesis used data from 798 participants in two clinical trials in Southern California and reported a 4.2% [95% confidence interval (CI): –0.2%, 8.9%] larger CIMT with a 10-μm/m3 increase in chronic exposure to PM2.5 ( Künzli et al. 2005 ). Several others have also used CIMT data to explore this association ( Adar et al. 2013 ; Bauer et al. 2010 ; Diez Roux et al. 2008 ; Erdogmus et al. 2006 ; Iannuzzi et al. 2010 ; Lenters et al. 2010 ; Rivera et al. 2013 ; Tonne et al. 2012 ; Wilker et al. 2013 ). However, the size and direction of associations have varied across studies. In addition to differences in susceptibility or the specific composition or extent of exposures, these inconsistencies might also be a consequence of differences in population measurement of CIMT, statistical models, adjustment sets, or exposure assessment.\nThe ESCAPE project (European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects) made unprecedented efforts to standardize the selection, modeling, and assignment of markers of exposure to ambient air pollution, as well as health-related statistical protocols, in a total of 30 European cohorts. Recently published results of prospective analyses of several of these cohorts suggested that particulate matter air pollution contributes to the incidence of coronary events and lung cancer in Europe ( Cesaroni et al. 2014 ; Raaschou-Nielsen et al. 2013 ). As part of the ESCAPE collaboration, we brought together four established cohorts with available CIMT measurements in adults. The objective of this analysis was to investigate the cross-sectional association between CIMT and a set of markers of long term exposure to ambient air pollution.\nMethods\nStudy population and CIMT data collection. Data from four ongoing European cohort studies were used. IMPROVE-Stockholm (Stockholm, Sweden) is based on 60-year-old adults at recruitment with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg; Augsburg, Germany), Heinz Nixdorf Recall (HNR; Ruhr Area, Germany), and REGICOR (Registre Gironí del COR; Girona region, Spain) are population-based cohorts (ages 25–75 years at baseline). CIMT was measured at least at one point in time between 1997 and 2009. B-mode ultrasound was used for CIMT measurement in all studies although sonographic protocols differed across studies. Details have been published elsewhere ( Baldassarre et al. 2010 ; Bauer et al. 2009 ; de Groot et al. 2008 ; Kowall et al. 2012 ; Rivera et al. 2013 ). In brief, in all cohorts, images were obtained by trained sonographers of segments of the left and right common carotid artery at the far artery wall approximately 10 mm proximal to the bulb. In IMPROVE-Stockholm and REGICOR, additional scans were obtained of the carotid bulb, and of the internal carotid 10 mm distal to the flow divider. Although only one image with 45° transducer angle was taken per location for REGICOR and HNR, images at different angles were taken at each location in the other cohorts. CIMT measurement was conducted manually in HNR, in which a maximum of 10 manual CIMT measurements per subject and side were conducted at 0.1-cm intervals over a 1-cm segment. Manual tracing was conducted in REGICOR, but a dedicated scan application protocol was used for CIMT measurements in any given 1 cm of the artery segment. Automatic tracing and measurements were conducted in IMPROVE-Stockholm and KORA. CIMT measurements in HNR were conducted in plaque-free areas only, whereas there was no specific protocol applied regarding plaques in other cohorts (i.e., measurements may include plaques). Only in IMPROVE-Stockholm was the presence of plaques additionally recorded. Cohort population characteristics and CIMT measurements are summarized in Supplemental Material, “Description of cohorts and Carotid-Intima Media Thickness data collection.” For comparability with past studies, and to address differences in CIMT measurement protocols, we used the mean of all IMT measurements of the left and/or right common carotid (CCA) far wall made 10 mm proximal to the bulb as the common outcome for the present analysis.\nThe four cohorts operate under approval of their respective ethical committees, and all participants gave written informed consent at time of original cohort enrollment.\nExposure assessment. We made use of all standard markers of exposure to ambient air pollution developed by the standardized land use regression models (LUR) of ESCAPE ( Cyrys et al. 2012 ; Eeftens et al. 2012 ). This included different fractions of the particulate matter mass concentrations, PM2.5 and PM10 (PM with diameter ≤ 2.5 and ≤ 10 μm), the coarse fraction of PM (PMcoarse), absorbance of PM2.5 (PM2.5abs), estimates of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Two markers of local traffic density were also collected under a standard protocol. Estimates of background levels of NOx, and NO2 were also available.\nDetails of standardized ESCAPE protocols and methods used to develop exposure models and traffic markers for each of the four study areas are given elsewhere ( Beelen et al. 2013 ; Eeftens et al. 2012 ). In brief, particulate matter (PM), NOx, and NO2 were measured over 2-week periods during three different seasons in 2008–2009 in all four study areas. Measurements were made at about 20 sites for PM and 40 sites for NOx and NO2 for the IMPROVE-Stockholm, HNR, and KORA study areas, and at twice as many sites for the REGICOR study area. PM2.5 and PM10 were collected on preweighed Teflon filters, and PMcoarse was obtained as their difference. PM2.5abs was measured on PM2.5 filters. Each monitoring site was further characterized by a set of potential geographical predictors. LUR models independently developed at each area were used to explain spatial variation at each measurement site, and the regression models obtained were then used to predict exposure concentrations at each cohort participant’s baseline home address. NO2 background LUR models were developed using a similar approach, but the LUR models were based only on regional and urban background sites and background predictors. The performance of the ESCAPE model was routinely tested across all ESCAPE cohorts ( Beelen et al. 2013 ; Eeftens et al. 2012 ). This was done by first comparing the explained variance between measured and predicted values obtained in the final model at all measured sites (model R2) and then by comparing measured values and predicted values at all measured sites for a model that was developed by excluding one measurement location at a time [leave-one-out-cross validation (LOOCV) R2].\nThe traffic indicators used in ESCAPE are traffic intensity on the nearest road (vehicles × day–1) and traffic load on major roads in a 100-m buffer, defined as the sum of traffic intensity multiplied by the length of all major road segments (vehicles × meters × day–1). Individual indicators of exposure to traffic were derived from the most recent road networks for Europe and from locally available traffic intensity data (for detailed description, see Supplemental Material, “Exposure assessment methods”).\nStatistical analysis. We used linear regression to estimate associations between the natural logarithm of CIMT and individually assigned measures of exposure. To independently estimate the effects of living near traffic, we adjusted analyses of traffic indicators for background NO2 with associations estimated using exposures modeled as both continuous and categorical variables to facilitate interpretation.\nThree predefined adjustment models were used for the main analysis, including a crude model (M1) and a model adjusted by age and sex only (M2). The third model (M3) was adjusted for sex, age and age squared, smoking status (current, former, never/occasional), cigarette pack-years and pack-years squared, education level (low, middle, high), occupational status (employed/self-employed, unemployed, homemaker/housewife, retired), and body mass index (BMI and BMI squared). Covariate definitions were standardized across cohorts to the extent possible. Except for IMPROVE-Stockholm based on two more individuals in M1 and M2 than in M3, for other cohorts, models M1 to M3 were restricted to individuals with complete data for all covariates included in model M3.\nFor model M3, subgroup analysis was conducted using a set of predetermined variables, namely sex, age (< 60 or ≥ 60 years), BMI (< 30 or ≥ 30 kg/m2), education (low, middle, or high), smoking status (current, former, or never/occasional), having either diabetes, impaired fasting glucose (treatment with insulin, oral hypoglycemic drugs or fasting blood glucose > 110 mg/dL) (yes/no), use of antihypertensive medication (yes/no), and use of statins (yes/no). We also hypothesized that clusters of cardiovascular risk factors could interact with exposure to air pollution in complex ways. Therefore, we calculated the Framingham risk score (FRS) for developing a general cardiovascular disease in a 10-year period ( Wilson et al. 1998 ) for each participant and evaluated for effect modification across three predefined levels of risk (low risk, < 10%; moderate risk, 10–20%; and high risk, > 20%). This stratification was also used to facilitate comparison between the older, high-risk IMPROVE-Stockholm cohort and the three younger population-based cohorts, because we assumed that differences among the populations would be less pronounced within strata defined by FRS categories. We further evaluated differences in effects between long-term residents and short-term residents. Long-term residents were defined as subjects living at the same address ≥ 10 years. For the HNR study, residential history was not available for all participants, and 5 years was the longest available cut-off. Thus HNR was excluded from this sub-analysis.\nThree additional stepwise adjustment models were developed for sensitivity analyses. First, we additionally adjusted model M3 by physical activity (categorized as low, middle, or high, or according to metabolic equivalents, depending on availability), alcohol intake (categories of drinks per week), and wine consumption (model M4a). Model M4a was further adjusted for continuous levels of systolic blood pressure and high- and low-density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL) (model M4b). Model 5 was adjusted for covariates in model M4b plus antihypertensive and statin medication use (M5). All covariates were defined a priori.\nWe additionally assessed the sensitivity of results by using estimates of air pollution back-extrapolated to the year of the CIMT measurements; adjusting for long-term noise exposure in 5-dB categories of day-evening-night noise (Lden) or night noise (Lnight); and by accounting for potential clustering by area because individuals living in the same areas may share similar characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic and environmental). ESCAPE exposure concentrations were developed with data collected between 2008 and 2009 that do not correspond to the year of CIMT measurement at each cohort. To adjust for possible differences in air pollution levels between time points and given the lack of historic LUR models to reconstruct historic spatial trends, individual exposures were back-extrapolated as follows: In each study region, available historic annual means (NO2, NOx, and PM10 only) from fixed-site monitoring stations were used to calculate the ratio between the average annual concentrations for the period of interest in the past and the period of the ESCAPE measurement. Individual ESCAPE exposure for each study participant was then multiplied by this ratio. Detail of the back-extrapolated approach followed in ESCAPE has been described elsewhere ( Cesaroni et al. 2012 ). Although this approach was meant to capture the long-term general changes in urban background pollution, it did not account for potential spatial within-city individual exposure changes. Exposure to ambient noise was obtained from the first round of noise mapping developed in the European Union (EU) in 2007 following the 2002 EU directive that required that all member states produce every fifth year a noise map for major roads, major railways, and major airports and for larger agglomeration ( European Commission 2002 ). To control clustering by area, a maximum-likelihood random-effects model was used. Area level was represented by an indicator of the neighborhood for IMPROVE-Stockholm and HNR, an indicator of municipality for REGICOR, and by a 5 × 5 km grid indicator for KORA.\nCohort-specific results were meta-analyzed for both fixed and random-effects and reported in forest plots. The heterogeneity of effect estimates among studies was evaluated with the I2 statistic ( Higgins and Thompson 2002 ). In the absence of heterogeneity, results from fixed-effects models are reported when describing the results. In the case of significant heterogeneity (p < 0.1 or I2 > 50%), random effects are reported instead ( DerSimonian and Laird 1986 ). Because the meta-analyses were based on only four individual studies, we did not attempt to evaluate the influence of specific study characteristics on the summary estimates. Subgroup-specific estimates were also meta-analyzed. Differences in stratum-specific effect estimates were qualitatively evaluated, without any formal test of the interactions.\nIn an expanded meta-analysis, ESCAPE estimates for PM2.5 were combined with estimates from other published cross-sectional studies that also used CIMT as outcome. We used a previous review to identify relevant studies ( Rivera et al. 2013 ) and also searched PubMed ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed ) to identify any additional studies published online before 2 September 2013. Different combinations of the key words “intima media thickness,” “air pollution,” “fine particulate air pollution,” “progression,” and ”atherosclerosis” were used in the search strategy.\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using Stata (version 12.1; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Results are presented for a preselected set of exposure contrasts that cover the variability of exposures observed across the ESCAPE project. The exposure contrasts for descriptive and categorical association analyses of traffic indicators were chosen to facilitate the interpretation of results throughout the ESCAPE project. For example, for traffic intensity at the nearest road, we used a 5,000 vehicle per day contrast, which is approximately equal to the traffic density of many urban roads in Europe, and thus represents the effect of a doubling of the traffic intensity on a typical major road. The default alpha level for statistical significance was assumed as 0.05.\nResults\nA total of 9,183 individuals were included in our study (based on a complete case analysis for model M3). Depending on the cohort, this represented 78–87% of the total cohort participants with both valid CIMT and air pollution measurements. A summary of common individual characteristics is provided in Table 1 . Mean CIMT ranged from 0.68 mm (in HNR) to 0.85 mm (in IMPROVE-Stockholm and KORA). Because of selection for higher cardiovascular risk, IMPROVE-Stockholm participants were older and more likely to be diabetic, and had lower levels of HDL and higher blood pressure on average than participants in the other cohorts. In addition, although participants from IMPROVE-Stockholm were less likely to be current smokers, they were more likely to be former smokers. Reported use of lipid-lowering medication was considerably more prevalent in REGICOR than in any other cohort. Educational levels differed considerably across cohorts. For example, 8% of participants were classified as having low education in KORA compared with 51.4% in REGICOR.\nTable 1 – Distribution of CIMT and selected baseline individual characteristics in the four cohort studies contributing to this ESCAPE analysis.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nThe distribution of air pollution exposures by cohort is presented in Table 2 . Mean levels of PM2.5 varied between 7.2 and 18.4 μg/m3, between 0.6 and 2.1 10–5/m for PM2.5abs, between 14.7 and 30.8 μg/m3 for PM10, between 6.2 and 15.6 μg/m3 for PMcoarse, between 10.4 and 32.5 μg/m3 for NO2, and between 18.1 and 56.1 μg/m3 for NOx. The lowest mean levels of pollutant exposures, except for PMcoarse, were estimated for participants in IMPROVE-Stockholm. Apart from PM2.5, mean exposures, including the traffic indicators, were highest in REGICOR ( Table 2 ). For REGICOR, < 57% of individuals lived in the lowest categories of traffic intensity and traffic load, whereas this percentage was > 65% for the other cohorts (see Supplemental Material, Table S1). With a few exceptions, exposure contrasts, indicated by the interquartile ranges (IQRs), were very small for PM in all cohorts (e.g., for PM2.5 the IQR ranges between 1.1 and 1.7 μg/m3) but rather large for NO2 or NOx (e.g., for NO2 the IQR ranges between 3.7 and 17.8 μg/m3) ( Table 2 ).\nTable 2 – Summary of cohort-specific individually assigned air pollutant and traffic exposure indicators\nView larger image (TIF File)\nPatterns of correlations between pollutants varied considerably across cohorts (see Supplemental Material, Table S2). For example the Spearman correlation coefficient (r) between PM2.5 and NO2 was around 0.6 in IMPROVE-Stockholm, HNR, and REGICOR, but only 0.38 in KORA. Similarly, a low r was observed between PM2.5 and PM2.5abs in this cohort (0.44), although it was > 0.8 in others. Correlation coefficients between pollutants and traffic indicators were low to moderate (0.08–0.62). Previously published R2 for model validation ranged across pollutants from 62% to 90% and from 51% to 87% for LOOCV R2 (see Supplemental Material, Table S2). The difference between model R2 and LOOCV R2 never exceeded 19% (percent point), below the 20% threshold usually interpreted as indication of potential model bias ( Eeftens et al. 2012 ).\nIn cohort-specific analyses of long-term air pollution exposures and CIMT, there were no statistically significant positive associations based on adjusted models (models M2–M5) except for positive associations with PM2.5 in KORA and PM2.5abs in REGICOR (both for model M2 only) (see Supplemental Material, Figure S1). In IMPROVE-Stockholm, a pattern of inverse associations was seen across all exposures, reaching statistical significance for PM10, PMcoarse, NO2, and NOx (see Supplemental Material, Figure S1A). Associations between traffic load and/or intensity were inconsistent between HNR and KORA and IMPROVE-Stockholm and REGICOR (see Supplemental Material, Figure S1E,F). Only for the latter cohorts did estimates with traffic load reach statistical significance in model M3. For all pollutants, in general, results were robust to the different adjustment sets, although models M4a, M4b, and M5 were based on fewer participants because of missing covariate data.\nMeta-analytic model M3 estimates of the association between CIMT and air pollution levels using ESCAPE cohort-specific estimates are presented in Figure 1A . Summary estimates across the four cohorts (n = 9,183) were positive but not statistically significant for PM2.5 and PM2.5abs. The combined fixed-effects estimates indicated a 0.72% (95% CI: –0.65%, 2.1%) increase in CIMT (geometric mean) per 5-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 and a 0.42% (95% CI: –0.46%, 1.30%) increase per 10–5/m increase in PM2.5abs. Summary estimates for the other pollutants (PMcoarse, PM10, NO2, and NOx) were inverse but not statistically significant, though there was significant heterogeneity across the studies (I2 > 50% or p < 0.1) in associations with all four pollutants. Estimates from combined analyses without IMPROVE-Stockholm, that showed a pattern of inverse significant results for these pollutants, did not change (result not shown) except for PMcoarse, for which direction of effects changed although remained non-statistically significant (0.37%; 95% CI: –1.49%, 2.26%).\nFigure 1 – Forest plot of the percent difference in CIMT (geometric mean with 95% CIs) for model M3 for (A) ESCAPE air pollutants per standard contrast of exposure as indicated in the figure, and (B) ESCAPE continuous traffic indicators. Traffic intensity: at the nearest road per contrast of exposure of 5,000 vehicles (veh) × day–1. Traffic load: within 100 m on major roads per contrast of exposure of 4,000,000 vehicles (veh) × day–1 × m–1. Fixed (I-V subtotal) and random effects [D+L (DerSimonian and Laird method)] are shown. I2: variation in estimated effects attributable to heterogeneity with percent weight I-V (inverse variance) as relative percent weight of each cohort (blue boxes). For IMPROVE-Stockholm, the arrow indicates direction of the effect estimate. Model M3 was adjusted for sex, age (centered on the sample mean), age2, smoking status (3 categories), smoking pack-years (centered), smoking pack-years2, education level (3 categories), occupation status (4 categories), BMI (centered), BMI2, indicator of city residence when applies.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nWe found positive but not statistically significant associations for traffic indicators ( Figure 1B ). For example, when considered on a continuous scale, we found a fixed-effects estimate of 0.29% (95% CI: –0.17%, 0.74%) higher CIMT (geometric mean) per 5,000 vehicles × day–1 in traffic intensity (over three cohorts only) and a 1.1% (95% CI: –0.56%, 2.7%) increase per 4,000,000 vehicles × day–1 × m–1 of traffic load (reported as random-effects because of significant heterogeneity). Estimates by categories of traffic markers were similarly positive but with some inconsistency across categories given the inhomogeneous distribution of traffic counts between cohorts. For example, for traffic load estimates were only generated for the third and fourth categories, and categorical associations for traffic intensity were positive for the second and fourth categories but null for the third (see Supplemental Material, Table S3).\nMeta-analytic estimates did not differ materially when adjusted for a random effect for neighborhood or when adjusted for noise (Lden or Lnight; results not shown for the latter) (see Supplemental Material, Table S4). Results remained similar when correcting exposures for historical trends (available only for NO2, NOx, and PM10).\nSubgroup-specific meta-analytic results are illustrated in Supplemental Material, Figure S2, for three selected pollutants. Some differences in magnitude of stratum-specific associations are worth mentioning: Associations appeared to be stronger in current smokers than in former smokers or nonsmokers (all pollutants); for NOx, all subgroup meta-analysis remained inversely non-statistically significant; for PM2.5, effects remained positive only for younger people, non-obese, non-diabetics, those with intermediate/higher education level, those using statin medication, and those with an intermediate FRS. Sex and use of hypertensive medication did not materially modify the direction of the main effects, and inverse association was observed for both long-term and short-term residents. For PM2.5abs inverse associations for males and those with low FRS were observed. Effects remained positive for both long-term and short-term residents.\nWe identified three studies reporting on a cross-sectional association between CIMT and PM2.5 suitable to be included in an extended meta-analysis. Two studies were conducted on populations > 40 years of age ( Adar et al. 2013 ; Künzli et al. 2010 ), whereas the other study population was approximately 25 years of age on average ( Lenters et al. 2010 ). Previously published results of HNR ( Bauer et al. 2010 ) were not retained, because this cohort was included in the primary ESCAPE analysis. We used the most recent cross-sectional results reported for the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution (MESA) population ( Adar et al. 2013 ). Given the very young age, we discarded one cross-sectional study of nonsmoking high-school students in the United States ( Breton et al. 2012 ). Exposure assessment in a study by Lenters et al. (2010) was based on a similar LUR approach used in ESCAPE; Künzli et al. (2010) used a geostatistical model to derive exposure assessment. MESA was based on a spatiotemporal model that also incorporated a component of LUR to predict concentrations at locations and times where measurements were not available ( Cohen et al. 2009 ). In the study by Künzli et al. (2010) and the MESA study, only measurements from the right common carotid were examined. Using results from models similar to our model M3, the extended meta-analytic estimate indicated a 0.78% (95% CI: –0.18%, 1.75%, p = 0.11) difference in CIMT per 5-μg/m3 contrast in PM2.5 ( Figure 2 ). For the population-weighted mean CIMT of 0.743 mm across the four ESCAPE cohorts, this result would correspond to a mean difference in CIMT of 5.8 μm with a 5-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5. No evidence for heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 0% or p = 0.557).\nFigure 2 – Forest plot of the percent difference in CIMT (geometric mean with 95% CIs) per 5 μg/m3 PM2.5 using the four ESCAPE cohort and previously published results.

(2013) : sex, age ethnicity, education, neighborhood socioeconomic score, adiposity, pack-years at baseline, and time-varying smoking status ( Table 2 ).\nView larger image (TIF File)\nDiscussion\nIn a meta-analyses of four cross-sectional European studies, we found positive but not statistically significant associations between CIMT and long-term estimates of residential exposure to several markers of air pollution, namely PM2.5, PM2.5abs, traffic load within 100 m of home, and traffic intensity at the nearest road. In contrast, inverse non-statistically significant associations were estimated for NO2, NOx, PM10, and PMcoarse. It is a major strength of ESCAPE that fully standardized sets of exposure metrics were derived to allow comparability across cohorts that otherwise present substantial population heterogeneity. Other strengths of this study include assessment of a comprehensive set of pollutants, cohorts covering a wide range of exposures, large numbers of participants, common information about potential confounders, and comparability of health analysis methods.\nExcept for IMPROVE-Stockholm, our cohort-specific and combined ESCAPE estimates for PM2.5 were within the range of other cross-sectional studies. A 5-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 2.1% (95% CI: –0.1%, 4.4%) higher CIMT among older adults in Los Angeles, California ( Künzli et al. 2005 ). A 0.47% (95% CI: –3.0%, 3.94%) increase of CIMT per 5-μg/m3 PM2.5 contrast was reported in the population-based study Atherosclerosis Risk in Young Adults, conducted in the Netherlands ( Lenters et al. 2010 ). In Germany, associations between PM2.5 and CIMT were slightly larger (4.1% increase; 95% CI: 1.7%, 6.5%, per 4.2 μg/m3 PM2.5), based on an earlier analysis of the HNR study using a different exposure model ( Bauer et al. 2010 ). In MESA, a 5-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 within cities was associated with a 0.2% (95% CI: –1.7%, 2.1%) increase in CIMT based on a model similar to our model M3. When these existing cross-sectional studies—except HNR, to avoid including the same study population twice—and our ESCAPE estimates were combined, the estimated difference in CIMT with a 5-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was < 1%.\nIn addition to PM2.5, our ESCAPE summary estimates were positive only for the set of standardized traffic indicators and PM2.5abs. The literature does not provide comparable estimates to expand the meta-analysis to these markers. PM2.5abs is considered a better marker of traffic-related particles than PM2.5, partly because of its larger spatial heterogeneity. Only one other study has used this indicator to evaluate the association between CIMT and long-term exposure to air pollution ( Wilker et al. 2013 ). Despite a very different population (elderly men only), this study conducted in the greater Boston, Massachusetts, area reported that a spatially resolved estimate of the home outdoor 1-year average black carbon concentration was associated with a 1.1% higher CIMT (95% CI: 0.4%, 1.4%) per 0.26-μg/m3 increase of this pollutant. Our results for PM10 were fairly inconsistent with those from a study based on 2,348 participants of the Whitehall II cohort of British civil servants and from a past HNR study ( Bauer et al. 2010 ; Tonne et al. 2012 ). Whitehall II reported a 5% difference (95% CI: 1.9%, 8.3%) for an IQR increase of 5.2 μg/m3 PM10. HNR reported a positive though not statistically significant association with PM10 (1.8% change; 95% CI: 0.6%, 4.3%, per 6.7 μg/m3 PM10).\nOur effect estimates were robust to several tests. The internal validation was good for the exposure models developed for our four cohorts. Adding covariates that may be on the causal pathway linking air pollution with atherosclerosis, such as blood pressure or medication to control blood pressure, did not substantially attenuate the coefficients. Associations also were not confounded by noise. Estimates were robust to adjustment for potential clustering by area, although the indicators used in the different cohorts represented different spatial dimensions, and residual confounding by area cannot be ruled out. We had no true long-term estimates of exposure, so the analyses rely on the assumption that current levels, as estimated in ESCAPE during 2008–2009, reflect long-term exposures before the CIMT measurement. However, the similarity of associations among long-term residents compared with those who moved residence (see Supplemental Material, Figure S2) suggests limited sensitivity. Studies investigating the validity of LUR-modeled exposures also suggest that the ESCAPE-modeled exposure reflects the spatial contrasts reasonably well over years ( Cesaroni et al. 2012 ).\nIt has been hypothesized that long-term air pollution exposure could act through a pathophysiological pathway that leads to endothelial dysfunction and subclinical atherosclerosis ( Brook and Rajagopalan 2010 ). In a study in Los Angeles, CIMT progression was estimated to be accelerated by 0.6 μm/year (95% CI: –0.1, 1.4 μm/year) per 2.5 μg/m3 PM2.5 ( Künzli et al. 2010 ). For the participants of the MESA population conducted in six cities across the United States, a 5.0-μm/year (95% CI: 2.6, 7.4 μm/year) faster progression of CIMT per 2.5 μg/m3 PM2.5 was estimated ( Adar et al. 2013 ). Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause for many cardiovascular outcomes. If air pollution accelerates atherosclerosis, the burden of air pollution may be larger than anticipated. By extension, a reduction of long-term exposure to air pollution may result in delays or reduction of this burden ( Künzli et al. 2011 ). It is possible that CIMT does not reflect the differential lifelong processes of atherosclerosis in different vascular beds and especially plaque formation in the carotid artery, which is more strongly related with clinical endpoints ( Lorenz et al. 2012 ). Development of atherosclerosis, together with interactions with other biological pathways or added susceptibility to acute air pollution triggers, could help explain such large risk as well ( Brook and Rajagopalan 2010 ).\nOur study presents weaknesses which may in part explain the null findings. The cross-sectionally assessed CIMT may be the result of all cumulative past atherogenic and atheroprotective exposures, including but not limited to air pollution ( Künzli et al. 2011 ). In addition, because exposure contrasts were rather limited within studies for most markers of exposure, statistical power to detect significant effects in such settings may be limited. The protocols and methods to measure CIMT differed across cohorts, though all studies tested the internal validity of their CIMT measurement methods and protocols. For example, high intra- and interobserved repeatability measures have been reported ( Baldassarre et al. 2007 ; Bauer et al. 2009 ; Kowall et al. 2012 ; Rivera et al. 2013 ). Our study design did not permit comparisons of validity across studies. However, the standardized analytical approach followed in ESCAPE aimed to minimize the possibility that large systematic bias has occurred.\nThe four studies had different designs and protocols for covariate assessments, thus, there were only limited options to more precisely operationalize some of these covariates in ways that would still be consistent across the studies. For example, socioeconomic status could only be represented by three levels of education and unspecific occupational status in the minimum adjusted model (model M3).\nCurrent smokers had stronger risk estimates, especially with PM2.5 exposure. Others have hypothesized that the difference in the precision of CIMTs measurements or competing risks for CIMT progression in some susceptible populations can bias results ( Adar et al. 2013 ; Rivera et al. 2013 ). The stratification by the FRS showed that when populations were made similar across cohorts, no modification existed. Thus modification by susceptibility factors such as smoking status could be interpreted here as an indication of some difference by location and may in part relate to the exposure modeling approach.\nFinally, nonsystematic exposure misclassification is a potential cause of bias toward null findings. Two of our cohorts previously published estimates of cross-sectional associations between CIMT and pollution based on other exposure models, but using data from most of the same subjects ( Bauer et al. 2010 ; Rivera et al. 2013 ). In REGICOR, individual exposure to NO2 was estimated as the 10-year time-weighted average of assigned home outdoor concentrations. The local REGICOR LUR model was based on 562 NO2 measurements in Girona and the 10 surrounding communities where participants lived ( Rivera et al. 2013 ). The difference in number of sampling sites between REGICOR LUR and ESCAPE LUR was attributable to the conceptual differences in the modeling designs. Although REGICOR was aimed at capturing the small-scale variation between residential addresses of cohort members in a Mediterranean city with narrow street canyons, ESCAPE was aimed at capturing exposure to main emission sources in a standardized manner all across regions in Europe. Comparison of performance between the REGICOR and the ESCAPE LUR models has been evaluated elsewhere ( de Nazelle et al. 2013 ). This study showed that models performed relatively similarly well at predicting their own measured concentrations, but the ESCAPE model increasingly overpredicted the measurements of independent data sets at higher NO2 levels. We found that for the same contrast of 10 μg/m3 in exposure to NO2, Rivera et al. (2013) reported a 0.22% (95% CI: –2.24%, 2.74%) coefficient for CIMT compared with –0.18% (95% CI: –0.89%, 0.53%) in our study. It has also been shown that the number of predictors tested to develop the LUR and the number of measurements influence the model performance ( Basagaña et al. 2012 , 2013 ; Wang et al. 2012 , 2013 ). This may have also contributed to some nondifferential biases in the ESCAPE model. In HNR, past individual exposure to PM2.5 was the average of daily concentrations of the 365 days before the examination day ( Bauer et al. 2010 ). PM2.5 individual exposures were predicted by a chemistry transport model coupled with daily data from monitoring stations (European Air Pollution Dispersion Model; EURAD-CTM). Again, the concepts of the exposure models differed between ESCAPE and the original HNR study, for which the EURAD-CTM exposure modeling was aimed at capturing urban background particulate matter concentrations (1-km2 grid). Estimates reported by Bauer et al. (2010) correspond to a 4.9% (95% CI: 2.0%, 7.7%) difference in CIMT per 5 μg/m3 PM2.5, whereas our estimate was 0.57% (95% CI: –1.95%, 3.14%) for the same exposure contrast. There remains a need to better understand bias from the different exposure models and implications for interpreting and comparing findings from epidemiological studies.\nIn a meta-analysis of four new cross-sectional European studies developed under standardized exposure and analytical protocols, we found no significant associations between CIMT and long-term estimates of residential exposure to eight predefined markers of air pollution, namely PM2.5, PM2.5abs, traffic load within 100 m of home, and traffic intensity at the nearest road. This contrasts with the strong experimental evidence for an atherogenic role of ambient particulate matter ( Araujo and Nel 2009 ; Sun et al. 2005 ; Suwa et al. 2002 ). Our meta-analytic estimate across all published studies for CIMT and PM2.5 was suggestive but not statistically significant. Given the public health relevance of atherosclerosis, further studies are needed to clarify the quantitative association between markers of atherogenesis and long-term exposure to air pollution and both the cross-sectional level and the longitudinal progression of atherosclerosis.\nEditor’s Note: After Advance Publication of this article, Perez et al. added Maria Foraster as a coauthor and corrected the misspelling of the name of coauthor Damiano Baldassare to Damiano Baldassarre.

A retrospective review of a pediatric autopsy database at a specialist center over a 16-year period was undertaken to identify any infant deaths (aged < 1 year), in whom death occurred while seated in a car safety seat. Fourteen car seat-associated deaths were identified from a total of 1,465 coronial infant autopsies (0.96 %). Four involved infants were being appropriately transported in the car seat, all of whom had a medical underlying cause of death (one infection and three congenital heart disease). The majority (10 cases; 70 %) occurred while car seats were being inappropriately used, outside of the car, including as an alternative to a cot or high-chair. Five of these infants died of explained causes, but four deaths remained unexplained after autopsy, and in one no cause of death was available. There were no cases of previously healthy infants dying unexpectedly in a car seat when it was being used appropriately, and in this series there were no cases of traumatic death associated with car seats, either during road traffic accidents, or from falling or being suspended from a car seat. Infant deaths in car seats are rare. These data support the recommendation that car seats be used only for transport and not as alternatives for cots or high-chairs. More research is required to investigate the effect of travel in car seats on infants with underlying conditions. There appears to be no increased risk of unexpected deaths of healthy infants transported appropriately in car seats. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.\nPublication data is maintained in RPS.

Being introduced into the dynamic chassis control of electrified vehicles, the electric motor torque can be used not only for driving and regenerative braking during normal operating conditions, but also offers a great potential to improve the dynamic control performance of the anti-lock braking under emergency deceleration situations.This paper presents a robust control algorithm for anti-lock braking of a front-wheel-drive electric vehicle equipped with an axle motor. The hydraulic and regenerative braking system of the electric vehicle is modeled as a LPV (linear parameter varying) system. The nonlinearities of the control system are considered as uncertain parameters of a linear fractional transformation. A static-state feedback control algorithm which is robust against the uncertainties is designed to achieve the maximum braking capability of the vehicle. To validate the control performance of the proposed algorithm, simulations are carried out. Based on the simulation results, the proposed anti-lock braking control algorithm can achieve the good robustness and control performance under different road adhesion coefficients, guaranteeing the brake stability of the electric vehicle.\nEvent:\n""","1.0","""http://papers.sae.org/2014-01-0140/""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"
"""Imperial_College_London""","""Respiratory Effects of Exposure to Diesel Traffic in Persons with Asthma | NEJM""","""Respiratory Effects of Exposure to Diesel Traffic in Persons with Asthma\nJames McCreanor, M.R.C.P.,\nAbstract\nBackground\nAir pollution from road traffic is a serious health hazard, and people with preexisting respiratory disease may be at increased risk. We investigated the effects of short-term exposure to diesel traffic in people with asthma in an urban, roadside environment.\nMethods\nWe recruited 60 adults with either mild or moderate asthma to participate in a randomized, crossover study. Each participant walked for 2 hours along a London street (Oxford Street) and, on a separate occasion, through a nearby park (Hyde Park). We performed detailed real-time exposure, physiological, and immunologic measurements.\nResults\nParticipants had significantly higher exposures to fine particles (<2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter), ultrafine particles, elemental carbon, and nitrogen dioxide on Oxford Street than in Hyde Park. Walking for 2 hours on Oxford Street induced asymptomatic but consistent reductions in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (up to 6.1%) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (up to 5.4%) that were significantly larger than the reductions in FEV1 and FVC after exposure in Hyde Park (P=0.04 and P=0.01, respectively, for the overall effect of exposure, and P<0.005 at some time points). The effects were greater in subjects with moderate asthma than in those with mild asthma. These changes were accompanied by increases in biomarkers of neutrophilic inflammation (sputum myeloperoxidase, 4.24 ng per milliliter after exposure in Hyde Park vs. 24.5 ng per milliliter after exposure on Oxford Street; P=0.05) and airway acidification (maximum decrease in pH, 0.04% after exposure in Hyde Park and 1.9% after exposure on Oxford Street; P=0.003). The changes were associated most consistently with exposures to ultrafine particles and elemental carbon.\nConclusions\nOur observations serve as a demonstration and explanation of the epidemiologic evidence that associates the degree of traffic exposure with lung function in asthma.\nIntroduction\nAir pollution from road traffic is a serious health hazard, and particulates from diesel exhaust have become cause for increasing concern. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated associations between ambient particulate matter and respiratory-associated morbidity and mortality; these effects may be greater among persons with preexisting respiratory disease, including asthma. 1,2\nDiesel engines emit relatively low concentrations of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, but as compared with gasoline engines of similar size, diesel engines can generate more than 100 times the number of particles per distance traveled 3 and are major contributors to atmospheric particulate pollution. In urban environments, almost 90% of traffic-generated particulate matter is from diesel exhaust. 4,5\nMany urban residents, including those with increased susceptibility to the effects of air pollution, have short-term exposure to diesel traffic during normal activities. Studies of humans in exposure chambers have shown that controlled exposure to diesel exhaust can provoke increased airway resistance 6,7 and bronchial inflammatory changes. 8-11 Such studies are limited by their artificial nature, however, and the small numbers of study participants have typically been healthy.\nWe explored the effects of roadside traffic exposure on people with mild or moderate asthma, of differing severity, on a busy city street where traffic is entirely diesel-powered. We tested the hypothesis that short-term, ambient exposures to diesel traffic would lead to a reduction in lung function and a worsening of symptoms, accompanied by increased inflammation in the lungs.\nMethods\nParticipants\nUsing advertising and volunteer databases, we recruited 60 adults with asthma, none of whom were smokers; 31 had mild asthma and 29 had moderate asthma, as defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma. 12 Each participant had intermittent wheezing and airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine; the concentration of methacholine required to provoke a 20% decrease (PC20) in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was <8 mg per milliliter. The participants were studied during periods of asthmatic stability, defined by the absence of exacerbations, respiratory infections, and treatment with oral corticosteroids for 4 weeks or more. During the study, the participants took their usual asthma medications.\nThe project was approved by the ethics committee at Brompton Hospital, London, and the institutional review board at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, New Jersey. Written informed consent was provided by all participants.\nStudy Design\nIn this randomized, crossover study, participants walked for 2 hours (10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.) along the western end of Oxford Street, London's busiest shopping street, where only diesel-powered buses and taxicabs are permitted, or through the traffic-free, western part of the nearby 142-hectare (about 350-acre) Hyde Park. Participants walked about 6 km during each exposure, at a steady pace on predefined paths, resting for 15 minutes every half hour. Exposure sessions, separated by more than 3 weeks, were confined to weekdays between November and March (2003 to 2005) to avoid pollen seasons; rainy days were also avoided. Equal numbers of participants were randomly assigned to each exposure sequence. The study had an estimated 90% power to detect a minimum difference in FEV1 response of 5.7% in each asthma-severity group between the two sites.\nClinical Measurements\nParticipants measured their peak expiratory flow on a mini–Wright meter and recorded asthma symptoms 1 week before and after each exposure session; during the week before each exposure, they wore a diffusion tube to measure individual exposure to nitrogen dioxide throughout the week. At Royal Brompton Hospital, baseline measurements of FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow at 25 to 75% of vital capacity (FEF25–75) were performed with the use of a spirometer (Vitalograph); the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) was recorded with the use of a chemiluminescence analyzer (Aerocrine). Exhaled breath condensate from tidal breathing was obtained with the use of a standardized breath-condensate collector (ECoScreen, Jaeger), and its pH was measured after de-aeration with argon.\nParticipants were driven for approximately 10 minutes to the exposure sites in a gasoline-powered car. On arrival and hourly during each session, we made further spirometric measurements; on completion of each session, we asked participants to record any asthmatic symptoms. After returning to the hospital, we repeated spirometric and FeNO measurements regularly for 5 hours and measured responsiveness to methacholine; participants recorded any asthma symptoms over the ensuing 12 hours. The next morning, we repeated measurements of lung function and FeNO and collected samples of sputum induced by inhalation of a 3% sodium chloride solution from an ultrasonic nebulizer. Total cell counts were performed on a homogenized sputum sample with the use of 0.1% dithiothreitol, and differential cell counts were performed on 400 nonsquamous cells on cytospin slides. Supernatants were kept at −80°C for analysis of interleukin-8, myeloperoxidase, and eosinophil cationic protein with the use of commercially available immunoassay kits (IL-8 DuoSet, R&D Systems; and TiterZyme and UniCAP, Pharmacia Diagnostics AB; respectively).\nExposure Measurements\nThroughout each exposure session, we measured number concentrations of ultrafine particles, using a real-time condensation particle counter (Model 3007, TSI) equipped with a ribbon laser light-scattering optical system (range, 0 to 100,000 particles per cubic centimeter; accuracy, ±20%). We collected fine particles smaller than 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) on quartz-fiber filters, using an air sampler (16 liters per minute). The filters were used first to determine PM2.5 mass concentration gravimetrically and were then analyzed for elemental carbon according to National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health guidelines (method 5040) (Sunset Laboratory). With a sampling pump, we collected nitrogen dioxide on C18 Sep-Pak cartridges coated with potassium hydroxide and triethanolamine and subsequently analyzed the sample using ion chromatography. 13 Temperature and relative humidity sensors, along with all air monitors, were located on a pushcart beside the participants.\nStatistical Analysis\nDescriptive summaries of exposure and health outcomes included means (±SD) for normally distributed variables and medians with ranges for other variables. Correlations between pollutants were examined.\nAssociations between exposure and health outcomes were examined through comparative analysis (Oxford Street vs. Hyde Park) and pollutant-specific, exposure-response analyses. A repeated-measures, mixed-effects linear regression model was constructed to estimate average values for health outcomes, with the use of an interaction term for the categorical variables of site and time to examine the effect of the exposure site on changes in lung-function or inflammatory biomarkers. 14 A random effect for individual participants accounted for similarities across sessions for each person. A spatial-power covariance structure was used to model correlations between the unequally spaced repeated measurements within each session with a decay in the strength of correlation, depending on the time between measurements. With the use of the Akaike information criterion, this structure proved to model the data adequately relative to an unstructured correlation matrix. Additional covariates, including temperature and relative humidity and, where necessary, age, sex, body-mass index, and race or ethnic group were entered as covariates. Type 3 F tests of the site–time interaction produced P values representing the overall significance of the effect of site on changes in responses over time; contrasts of means were used to examine differences between sites in changes from baseline to particular time points. To study potential effect modifiers, we tested interactions between them and site–time interaction and conducted stratified analyses.\nBecause pollutant concentrations varied within and between sites, we performed pollutant-specific, exposure-response analyses using mixed models, as described above. In these models, we regressed the percent change from baseline in each of the lung-function and inflammatory-biomarker variables against pollutant concentrations averaged over each exposure session. Separate, single-pollutant models for PM2.5, elemental carbon, ultrafine particles, and nitrogen dioxide were generated. Subsequently, we used two-pollutant models, in which two of the four pollutants were analyzed simultaneously.\nResults\nTable 1.\nTable 1. Baseline Characteristics of the Study Participants.\nAs anticipated, participants with mild asthma had a higher baseline FEV1 than those with moderate asthma. They were also less likely to report limited exercise tolerance or symptoms provoked by exercise or traffic fumes ( Table 1 ).\nTable 2.\nTable 2. Exposure Measurements for Oxford Street and Hyde Park and Lung Function before Exposure.\nMedian weekly nitrogen dioxide exposures were not significantly different before exposure at the two sites ( Table 2 ). Participants had significantly higher exposures to PM2.5, ultrafine particles, elemental carbon, and nitrogen dioxide on Oxford Street than in Hyde Park. Spearman's rank-correlation coefficients for exposures to the four pollutants were as follows: 0.58 for the correlation of nitrogen dioxide with both ultrafine particles and elemental carbon, 0.62 for the correlation of PM2.5 with ultrafine particles, and 0.84 for the correlation of ultrafine particles with elemental carbon. (Complete information is provided in Table A1 of the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org.)\nAverage daily peak expiratory flow, symptoms, and use of asthma medication did not differ significantly in the week before exposures at the two sites. Similarly, there were no significant differences between the sites in mean FEV1, FVC, or FEF25–75 at baseline in the hospital or on arrival at the site ( Table 2 ). On the whole, changes over time in mean FEV1 and FVC differed significantly between the sites (P=0.04 and P=0.01, respectively), but there were no significant differences between sites in the changes in FEF25–75. Mean FEV1 (percent of the predicted value) was lower after 1 hour of exposure at both sites. The subsequent decrement was greater and more sustained for Oxford Street, with a maximal decline at 2 hours (−6.1%, vs. −1.9% for Hyde Park; P<0.001). The differences between sites remained significant at every time point (P<0.05) until 22 hours after exposure. Among participants with moderate asthma, the decline in FEV1 was greater for Oxford Street than for Hyde Park, but the difference was not significant.\nFigure 1.\nFigure 1. Mean Percent Changes in FEV1and FVC during and after Exposure on Oxford Street and in Hyde Park.\nPercent changes from initial values in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) are shown for all the study participants (Panels A and B, respectively), those with mild asthma (Panels C and D, respectively), and those with moderate asthma (Panels E and F, respectively). Asterisks denote P<0.05 for the difference in values between Oxford Street and Hyde Park exposures. I bars represent 95% CI.\nThe pattern for mean FVC (percent of predicted value) was similar ( Figure 1 ), with a maximum drop after 2 hours (−5.4% for Oxford Street vs. −1.6% for Hyde Park, P<0.005). The differences in changes in FVC between the two sites were significant at each time point between 2 and 5 hours after the start of exposure (P<0.05) and were significantly greater among participants with moderate asthma than among those with mild asthma (P=0.008). There were no significant differences in the mean change in FEF25–75 (percent of predicted value) between sites or in the methacholine PC20 value 5 hours after exposure.\nChanges in respiratory symptoms during and after exposures were small. Participants with mild asthma reported more symptoms after exposures on Oxford Street (both immediately afterward and 5 hours afterward) than after exposures in Hyde Park, but the differences were not significant. The use of treatments for asthma relief over the 7-day period after exposure did not differ significantly between the two sites.\nFigure 2.\nFigure 2. Mean Changes in Exhaled Breath Condensate pH, Sputum Neutrophil Counts, Supernatant Interleukin-8, and Supernatant Myeloperoxidase before and after Exposure on Oxford Street and in Hyde Park.\nChanges in exhaled breath condensate pH are shown in Panel A for all participants, in Panel B for those with mild asthma, and in Panel C for those with moderate asthma. Changes in sputum neutrophil counts, supernatant interleukin-8, and supernatant myeloperoxidase are shown in Panels D, E, and F, respectively, for all subjects. With the use of mixed-effect models to test for overall changes in exhaled breath condensate pH over time, P=0.01 for all participants, P=0.27 for participants with mild asthma, and P=0.02 for participants with moderate asthma. T bars represent 95% CI.\nThere were no significant differences in the changes in mean FeNO between exposures on Oxford Street and those in Hyde Park. There were greater decreases in the pH of exhaled breath condensate after exposure on Oxford Street — 1.16%, as compared with 0.88% in Hyde Park at 3 hours, and −1.90% as compared with 0.04% in Hyde Park at 6 hours ( Figure 2 ). The changes were not significantly greater among participants with moderate asthma.\nThe sputum myeloperoxidase concentration at 24 hours was higher after exposure on Oxford Street (24.5 ng per milliliter) than after exposure in Hyde Park (4.2 ng per milliliter, P=0.01) ( Figure 2 ). Sputum neutrophil counts and interleukin-8 concentrations were strongly correlated with myeloperoxidase (P<0.001 for both comparisons), and each was higher after Oxford Street exposures; only in the case of sputum neutrophil counts (for all participants), however, was this difference significant. There were no significant differences in sputum eosinophil counts or eosinophil cationic protein levels. We found no consistent evidence of an interaction between these health outcomes and the other variables listed in Table 1 (and Table A2 in the Supplementary Appendix ).\nFigure 3.\nFigure 3. Point Estimates and 95% CI of the Percent Change in Health End Points per Incremental Change in Pollutant Components.\nChanges in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of vital capacity (FEF25–75), and the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) are shown according to incremental changes in the levels of ultrafine particles (Panel A), fine particles (Panel B), elemental carbon (Panel C), and nitrogen dioxide (Panel D).\nReductions in FEV1, FVC, FEF25–75, and exhaled breath condensate pH were associated with ultrafine-particle exposures at most time points ( Figure 3 ); these reductions were also associated, although less consistently, with elemental carbon exposures (for ultrafine particles, P=0.02, P=0.27, P=0.11, and P=0.03, respectively; for elemental carbon, P=0.04, P=0.11, P=0.32, and P=0.24, respectively). Elemental carbon exposures were also associated with increases in FeNO concentrations (P=0.06). For nitrogen dioxide, the associations were similar but less pronounced; for PM2.5, there were no consistent associations. Increased sputum myeloperoxidase concentrations were associated with ultrafine-particle exposure (P=0.03). There were no associations between sputum cell counts or interleukin-8 and any of the pollutant constituents. After adjustment for copollutants in the two-pollutant models, the effects of ultrafine particles and elemental carbon remained the most consistent and were significant (Table A3 in the Supplementary Appendix ).\nDiscussion\nWe examined the functional and inflammatory effects on asthma of real-life exposure to roadside diesel traffic. In adults with asthma, walking for 2 hours at a leisurely pace along a street where only diesel-powered vehicles were permitted resulted in a significant but essentially asymptomatic reduction in lung function. Although the changes were small, they were greater than those provoked by walking in a nearby park and were more pronounced among study participants whose asthma was more severe. These changes were accompanied by inflammatory changes in sputum and exhaled breath condensate.\nThe inflammatory response was predominantly neutrophilic, with raised levels of myeloperoxidase and interleukin-8 in sputum supernatants; we did not detect, even in participants with more severe asthma, an eosinophilic response characteristic of asthmatic inflammation. In association with the drop in FEV1, we found a twofold increase in exhaled-breath-condensate hydrogen ions after exposure on Oxford Street. Acute asthma may be accompanied by airway acidification, with an increase in hydrogen ions by a factor of more than 100, 15 perhaps reflecting inhibition of local epithelial proton pumps during airway inflammation. 16 Thus, intracellular acidosis related to the inflammatory process may be reflected in reduced airway pH. 17\nIt has been suggested that any harmful respiratory effects of acute exposure to diesel exhaust are attributable more to its particulate content than to its gaseous content. 18 In addition to coarse particles (2.5 to 10 μm in diameter), diesel exhaust contains, in far greater numbers, ultrafine particles (<0.1 μm in diameter). In our study, the most consistent relationships between changes in respiratory variables and specific pollutant concentrations were for ultrafine particles and elemental carbon, a finding consistent with growing evidence that the adverse respiratory effects of diesel-generated particles are attributable to those in the very small size range. 19-23 With their higher ratio of surface area to mass, ultrafine particles can adsorb greater fractions of potentially toxic substances onto their surface, and they are deposited more deeply and in greater numbers within the lung than are larger particles. Furthermore, the carbon core of elemental carbon particles is highly adsorptive. 24 Differences in the concentrations of ultrafine particles and elemental carbon between Oxford Street and Hyde Park were substantially larger than the differences in concentration between PM2.5 and particles less than 10 μm in diameter. However, our findings cannot be taken as a demonstration of a causal association with ultrafine particles and elemental carbon, since these may simply be a sensitive proxy for the entirety of a roadside diesel-traffic exposure, which is composed not only of the complex diesel exhaust mixture but also of resuspended coarse, thoracic particles (small enough to enter the thorax) from road dust and engine or tire debris, which we did not measure.\nPrevious studies of the direct effects of diesel exhaust on asthma in humans have been conducted under laboratory conditions, with fresh diesel fumes, from which gaseous constituents may have been removed (“scrubbed”), or reconstituted diesel exhaust material delivered to subjects in an exposure chamber. 6,7,11,25-27 The findings of these studies have not been entirely consistent, and none of them have demonstrated an effect on spirometric lung function, despite the use of much higher concentrations of diesel particles than those we measured on Oxford Street. The discrepancies between the findings of other studies and our own may be due to the complexity of the natural pollutant mixture we studied, with interactions between particulates and other pollutants, or to the possibility that reconstituted or scrubbed diesel exhaust mixtures substantially reduce the proportion of ultrafine particles. In addition, we studied people with more severe asthma. Svartengren et al., 28 in a realistic study of brief exposure to traffic pollution in a road tunnel, also failed to find any effect on FEV1 but reported more symptoms than we observed. Personal exposures to PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide were much higher in that study, but the study participants had milder asthma than did the participants in our study. On the other hand, the inflammatory responses we observed, particularly the increase in sputum neutrophils and myeloperoxidase, were similar in nature to those in studies of controlled, chamber exposures. 8,10,26,28\nOur primary motive was to understand the effects of typical exposures to an urban atmosphere dominated by diesel exhaust. To this end, we selected a setting where only diesel traffic was allowed and used a randomized, crossover design limited to the winter months to avoid confounding exposure to pollens, thereby removing or controlling for most important confounding factors. Nonetheless, we recognize some limitations of our study, including the impossibility of blinding participants and the inability to exclude the possibility of subjective responses, particularly with symptom reporting. However, the internal consistency of our findings and the changes in variables over which the participants had no control make it very improbable that our results arose entirely from a subjective bias. Another difficulty arises from potentially confounding exposures that we did not measure. For example, a walk on Oxford Street is likely to be a more stressful experience than a walk in a quiet park, and it is possible that some of the responses we measured were induced by factors associated with stress, particularly noise. 29 In addition, because we did not study a reference group of people without asthma, we cannot be sure that our findings are specific to people with asthma, although the more pronounced responses in the participants with more severe disease suggest that the findings are specific. Finally, we did not study exposure to gasoline-powered traffic and therefore cannot conclude that diesel traffic is more toxic than other types.\nOur observations serve as a direct demonstration and explanation of the epidemiologic evidence that associates exposure to diesel traffic with the severity of asthma and of the symptoms that many patients with asthma report after exposure to diesel exhaust. The changes in our primary end point (FEV1) were small and unaccompanied by clinically significant symptoms but would be more important in patients with more compromised lung function. Without further study, however, we do not believe that these findings should deter most patients with asthma from visiting or working in busy urban environments. Our design has considerable advantages over orthodox chamber studies and could readily be adapted to assess therapeutic strategies in the prophylaxis of traffic responses in asthma or other cardiorespiratory diseases.\nFunding and Disclosures\nSupported by the Health Effects Institute through a Research Agreement (02-9) with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.\nDr. Cullinan reports serving as a member of the Expert Advisory Panel for Air Quality Standards for the U.K. government.

Methods for measuring mechanical properties and interface adhesion of an SOFC have been developed and measurements made on a cermet-supported SOFC with a SDC electrolyte. The SOFC evaluated had a porous NiO-YSZ substrate, a porous NiO-SDC anode and a dense SDC electrolyte fabricated using tape-casting, screen-printing and co-firing techniques. The flexural strength and interface adhesion of the substrate, the anode and the electrolyte, along with their Young’s modulus, hardness and residual stress, were quantitatively measured. The results of the measurements indicate that the NiO-YSZ supported, SDC electrolyte SOFC has adequate mechanical strength and sufficient interface adhesion.\n1421\nComments on the Quantification of Mechanical Adhesion Energy of Thermal Oxide Scale on Metallic Substrate Using Tensile Test\nAuthors: Somrerk Chandra-ambhorn, P. Promdirek, Gobboon Lothongkum, Yves Wouters, Alain Galerie\nAbstract: The tensile test, accompanied by the corresponding theoretical model, has been developed to quantify the mechanical adhesion energy of the oxide scale on metallic substrate in our previous works. The method to quantify the adhesion energy took into account the effect of residual stress. The effect of the variation of the measured residual stress on the quantified adhesion energy is assessed in this paper. For the scales failed at strains initiating the spallation of 0.018 and 0.011 followed by the transverse crack, it was found that the quantified adhesion energy of the oxide is not sensitive to the variation of the residual stress measured in the range from 0.5 to 2.0 GPa. This is due to the compensation of the decrease in stored energy due to the stress applied in the loading direction (x direction) and the increase in stored energy due to the stress applied in the direction perpendicular to the loading direction (y direction) when the residual stress increases. For the scale failed by the transverse crack followed by the spallation, the quantified adhesion energy tends to be sensitive to the variation of the measured residual stress. The assumption of energy relaxation during the tensile test is alternatively proposed. It is assumed that the energy stored due to the stress in x and y directions is totally released at the first crack. The energy stored due to the stress in y direction from strain initiating the crack to strain initiating the spallation is used in the quantification of the adhesion energy. The scatter of the adhesion energy values quantified by this method and those measured by the inverted-blister test is reduced comparing to the results reported in the previous work.\n907\nSimulation Study on Concrete Structure Bonding with Steel Plate\nAuthors: Yan Lin Wang, Lan Ying Wu, Ling Gang Wang\nAbstract: The building structure reinforcement simulation system is very necessary for the rapid development of the building reinforcement industry, in this paper, the feasibility of the simulation on concrete structure bonding with steel plate was analyzed, and the influence of deformation and stress of concrete beam was studied by the thickness of steel plate and bonding layer. The research results show that the cracking load of the original concrete beam model is 8.712 KN, the limit load is 8.92 KN, and the midpoint displacement is 0.4443 mm; when the thickness of steel plate is 4 mm, the limit load is 11.579 KN, comparing it to the 8.92 KN of the original concrete beam model, the bearing capacity can be improved to 32.91%; The maximum adhesion stress at the end of the bonding layer increases first and then decreases as the thickness of the bonding layer increases, the ratio between the maximum adhesion stress and the minimum adhesion stress increases first and then decreases as the thickness of the bonding layer increases.\n3735\nInfluence of Inhibition Layer on Adhesion of a Galvanized High Al Dual Phase Steel\nAuthors: Zhao Jun Deng, Jing Liu, Zhi Hong Lu, Hui Wang, Cheng Jiang Lin\nAbstract: The morphology of inhibition layer and adhesion of Zn coating about a 600MPa grade high Al dual phase steel were studied by grow discharge spectrometry (GDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that the inhibition layer is mainly composed of Fe2Al5-xZnx particles with a size of 0.5~1μm, and the adhesion is directly related to the density of the inhibition layer, the denser the inhibition layer, the better the adhesion. It is found: for the samples with good adhesion that besides the Fe2Al5-xZnx particles, there are also some small spherical Al-Mn oxides particles in sizes from 30 to 100nm uniformly distributed in the inhibition layer; for the samples with bad adhesion, the steel substrate is not fully covered by Fe2Al5-xZnx particles and large amount manganese oxides are detected at the non-covered positions.\n1669\nMechanical Properties of AlCrTiSiN Coatings Developed by Cathodic Arc for Protection Applications\nAuthors: Nurot Panich, Surasak Surinphong, D.A. Karpov, Yong Kwang Tan, Chin Foo Goh, Jan Ma\nAbstract: The aim of this work is to fabricate and develop the innovative ceramic coatings for protection applications with both high hardness and coating adhesion particularly performing in extremely environmental conditions. In this study, nanocomposite AlCrTiSiN coatings were developed and deposited on Carbide coupons (WC with Co binder) substrate using Cathodic Arc Deposition techniques. The resultant coatings were evaluated with respect to fundamental mechanical properties such as hardness, modulus and coating adhesion. It was found that the nanomposite AlCrTiSiN coatings has a good adhesion to the substrate and retained extremely high hardness as superhard coatings with hardness values above 50 GPa.\n81\n""","0.16759244","""https://www.scientific.net/KEM.644.96""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

Research indicates that complexity is the prime determinant of the air traffic controller's workload. Research has attempted to define and classify complexity variables that have been used to assess the capacity of en route airspace in Europe and North America. Such variables can also be used to assist in ATC sector design by highlighting those complexity factors that can lead to high workload and potentially risky scenarios for the controller. With the use of a structured interview technique, a study analyzed these ATC complexity variables for their impact on controller workload and safety. Seventy-nine air traffic controllers were interviewed about the factors that affected their workload. These controllers were based in 14 area control centers in Europe, including those of high complexity, such as Maastricht, Netherlands, as well as in nine centers in Asia, one in Africa, and Mumbai, India, a region with major traffic growth in recent years. On the basis of these interviews, a taxonomy of more than 50 complexity variables subdivided into 11 major groupings, such as traffic mix and entry and exit points, has been developed. In addition to rating of the impact of the individual complexity factors to assess their effect on airspace, interactions between complexity variables were deduced from the interviews. These interactions enable assessment of the factors that add to layers of complexity for controllers. Such a taxonomy can assist airspace planners in designing sectors that avoid complex ATC situations. How the impact of such complexity factors can be investigated in sector design is outlined.\n< >\nTransportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board\nTransportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board\nPrint ISSN: 0361-1981\n""","1.0103515","""http://trrjournalonline.trb.org/doi/10.3141/2007-09""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

After analysing the relative trade-offs between performance and computational effort, we compare the two MPC strategies against each other and against an unconstrained optimal control strategy in Simulink and Carsim environment.\n""","10.512293","""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00423114.2015.1064972""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

The system utilizes the latest 3D computer animation techniques, combined with artificial intelligence, robotics and psychology, to model human behavior, reactions and decision making under expected/unexpected dangers in real-time in virtual environments. The development of the system includes: classification on the conscious/subconscious behaviors and reactions of different people; capturing different motion postures by the Eagle Digital System; establishing 3D character animation models; establishing 3D models for the scene; planning the scenario and the contents; and programming within Virtools (TM) Dev. Programming within Virtools (TM) Dev is subdivided into modeling dangerous events, modeling character's perceptions, modeling character's decision making, modeling character's movements, modeling character's interaction with environment and setting up the virtual cameras. The real-time simulation of human reactions in hazardous environments is invaluable in military defense, fire escape, rescue operation planning, traffic safety studies, and safety planning in chemical factories, the design of buildings, airplanes, ships and trains. Currently, human motion modeling can be realized through established technology, whereas to integrate perception and intelligence into virtual human's motion is still a huge undertaking. The challenges here are the synchronization of motion and intelligence, the accurate modeling of human's vision, smell, touch and hearing, the diversity and effects of emotion and personality in decision making. There are three types of software platforms which could be employed to realize the motion and intelligence within one system, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed.\nURI: \n""","0.52510023","""http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/1621""","[-0.472855,51.532848]"

Significant safety improvements in other high risk organizations such as the aviation industry have led to the concept of a high reliability organization (HRO)—a high risk organization that has enjoyed a prolonged safety record. A strong organizational culture is common to all successful HROs, encompassing powerful systems of selection and training. Aircrew selection processes provide a good example of this and are examined in detail in this article using the Royal Air Force process as an example. If the lessons of successful HROs are to be applied to health care organizations, candidate selection to specialties such as surgery must become more objective and robust. Other HROs can provide valuable lessons in how this may be approached.\nKeywords\nNational Health Service Situation Awareness Crew Resource Management High Reliability Organization Nontechnical Skill \nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access\nNotes\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank Air-Vice Marshal C.P.A.

However, models have rarely offered variables that account for the dispersion environment close to the source (e.g., street canyons, position and dimensions of buildings, road width). This study used newly available data on building heights and geometry to enhance the representation of land use and the dispersion field in LUR. Models were developed for PM10, NOX, and NO2 for 2008–2011 for London, U.K. A separate set of models using “traditional” land use and traffic indicators (e.g., distance from road, area of housing within circular buffers) were also developed and their performance was compared with “enhanced” models. Models were evaluated using leave-one-out (n – 1) (LOOCV) and grouped (n – 25%) cross-validation (GCV). LOOCV R2 values were 0.71, 0.50, 0.66 and 0.73, 0.79, 0.78 for traditional and enhanced PM10, NOX, and NO2 models, respectively. GCV R2 values were 0.71, 0.53, 0.64 and 0.68, 0.77, 0.77 for traditional and enhanced PM10, NOX, and NO2 models, respectively. Data on building volume within the area common to a 20 m road buffer within a 25 m circular buffer substantially improved the performance (R2 > 13%) of NOX and NO2 LUR models.\nInformation  on sources of data used in the study, further information on the development of variables and LUR models, and evaluation of the models.

However, transport infrastructure and control systems remain sovereign and now the supply side poses the problem. Remedies concentrate on harmonization and integration programmes for existing control systems, and on the development of future pan‐European systems. This paper considers two such programmes, that for air traffic control and for train control. First, the legislation behind liberalization of transport markets and the European Union's role in promoting this is highlighted, before outlining the various barriers to the benefits from liberalization. From this follows an investigation of the EATCHIP programme for air traffic control and the ETCS programme for an advanced train control system, noting the similarity in their objectives—to increase capacity without compromising safety—and the methods chosen to achieve them. The next section looks at the organizational structures for the EATCHIP and ETCS programmes to ensure timely delivery, and concludes that the present set‐up is more favourable for EATCHIP. The final section considers the technical challenges to European industry required for success in each programme and the consequences of delay in their achievement.\nL'Europe est en train de passer d'une organisation des infrastructures et du fonctionnement des marchés de transport à base nationale à une base européenne; la libéralisation de ces marchés accélère encore cette tendance. Toutefois, actuellement, les infrastructures et les systèmes de contrôle appartiennent toujours à la sphère de la souveraineté nationale. Les difficultés qui en résultent sont atténuées par des efforts d'harmonisation et d'intégration des programmes nationaux, ainsi que par la conception de futurs programmes paneuropéens.\nCet article porte sur deux de ces programmes, l'un sur le contrôle du trafic aérien, l'autre sur celui du trafic ferroviaire. Il faut remarquer tout d'abord que, sous le couvert d'une libéralisation du transport, c'est une nouvelle législation qui se met en place, et, donc, une nouvelle série d'obstacles aux bénéfices attendus de la libéralisation. C'est sous cet angle que sont analysés les deux grands systèmes, EATCHIP pour le contrôle aérien et ETCS pour le contrôle ferroviaire, et qu'apparaît la similitude des objectifs poursuivis (l'accroissement des capacités sans diminution du niveau de sécurité) et des méthodes retenues pour y arriver. Suit une comparaison entre les structures organisationnelles des deux programmes, qui met évidence les facteurs favorables à un meilleur respect des délais pour EATCHIP. Enfin, il est démontré que la réussite dépendra de l'aptitude de l'industrie européaenne à faire face aux défis qui lui sont proposés et des conséquences dommageables de tout retard important.\nDie Liberalisierung der Verkehrsmärkte in Europa beschleunigt die Umwandlung der bestehenden nationalen Verkehrsysteme in ein europäisches System. Die bestehenden Angebotsengpässe müssen bei fortgesetzter nationaler Kontrolle der Infrastrukturen und Steuerungssysteme angegangen werden. Die Lösungen konzentrieren sich zur Zeit auf Programme zur Harmonisierung und Integration der bestehenden Steuerungssysteme und auf die Entwicklung neuer europaweiter Systeme. Dieser Beitrag beschreibt zwei solche Programme: das für den Luftverkehr und das für den Eisenbahnverkehr.\nAls erstes wird die Gesetzgebung beschrieben, die zur Liberalisierung der Verkehrsmärkte geführt hat und die Rolle der EU dabei; als zweites werden die verschiedenen Hindernisse bei der Umsetzung der Liberalisierungsgewinne im einzelnen dargestellt. Als nächstes werden die EATCHIP und ETCS Programme und ihre Umsetzungsmethoden (für Luftverkehr, bzw. Eisenbahnverkehr) untersucht. Beide zielen auf eine Erhöhung der vorhandenen Kapazitäten bei gleichbleibender Betriebsicherheit. Eine Analyse der jeweiligen Organisationsstrukturen zeigt, daß momentan EATCHIP eher in der Lage sein sollte, seine Ziele au erreichen. Abschließend werden die industriellen Herausforderungen beschrieben und die möglichen Nachteile bei einer versögerten Umsetzung der Programme.\nEn le sector transporte europeo la transformación de una infraestructura y operaciones basada en las distintas naciones a una pan‐europea, se ha visto acelerada por la mayor liberalización de los mercados de transporte. Sin embargo, la infraestructura fija y los sistemas de control permanecen soberanos, por lo que la componente oferta constituye un problema en la actualidad. Las soluciones van por el lado de programas de integración y armonización de los sistemas de control existentes, y el desarrollo a futuro de sistemas pan‐europeos. Este trabajo considera dos programas de este tipo: uno para el control de tráfico aéreo y el otro para el control de operaciones ferroviarias. Antes de discutir las diversas barreras, asi como los beneficios de la liberalización de los mercados de transporte, se revisa la legislación detrás de ella y roi de la Unión Europea en promoverla. Luego de esto sigue una investigación del programa EATCHIP para control de tráfico aéreo y de los programas ETCS para control avanzado de sistemas ferroviarios, resaltando la similitud de sus objetivos—aumentar la capacidad sin comprometer la seguridad—y los métodos seleccionados para alcanzarlos. La próxima sección examina las estructuras organizacionales escogidas por ambos programas para garantizar su entrega a tiempo, y concluye que el esquema actual favorece al programa EATCHIP.

Floors of modern office buildings are prone to occupant-induced vibrations. The contributing factors include long spans, slender and flexible designs, use of lightweight materials and low damping. As a result, resonant frequencies often fall in the range easily excited by normal footfall loading, creating potential serviceability problems due to undesirable levels of vibrations. This study investigates in-situ performance of a non-composite timber-concrete floor located in a recently constructed innovative multi-storey office building. The floor monitoring system consists of several displacement transducers to measure long-term deformations due to timber and concrete creep and three accelerometers to measure responses to walking forces, the latter being the focus of this paper. Floor response is typically complex and multimodal and the optimal accelerometer locations were decided with the help of the effective independence-driving point residue (EfI-DPR) technique. A novel approach to the EfI-DPR method proposed here uses a combinatorial search algorithm that increases the chances of obtaining the globally optimal solution. Several months worth of data collected by the monitoring system were analyzed using available industry guidelines, including ISO2631-1:1997(E), ISO10137:2007(E) and SCI Publication P354. This enabled the evaluation of the floor performance under real operating conditions.\nInfo:\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.569-570.230\nCitation:\nP.

Deterioration and destabilisation of these buildings may result, especially if they were previously damaged (e.g. earthquakes or settlement problems). To better understand building response, vibration measurements were conducted on the Little Hagia Sophia Mosque, located adjacent to Istanbul’s Sirkeci-Halkali railway line. Transport-induced vibrations were recorded at several points on the ground and building. Attenuation characteristics in the ground and amplification features on the building were examined. Peak particle velocities often exceeded previously established thresholds for human perception and in some cases for structural damage. These are evaluated with respect to the building’s condition.\n569\nEvaluation of Dynamic Characteristics of Masonry Arch Bridges: Linking Full-Scale Experiment and FEM Modeling\nAuthors: Joanna M. Dulinska\nAbstract: The paper presents calculated and experimentally determined dynamic characteristics of masonry arch bridges. Two bridges were considered: the road viaduct at Zaborow and the bridge at Kamienica Dolna (South Poland). Finite element models were built considering all parts of the structures: arch, spandrel walls, fill, soil-structure interaction. For verification of calculations in situ investigations of dynamic characteristics of bridges were conducted. As a basic ways of realization of dynamic loads impulse load (drop of a lorry wheels from a threshold) as well as kinematic excitation (train passage under the viaduct) were applied. For determination of natural frequencies power spectral density function and transfer function of measured signals were applied. Basing upon the recorded vibrations the value of logarithmic decrement of damping was evaluated. The results of measured and calculated natural frequencies were compared. With regard to the degree of complexity of structures the differences between experimental and computational results can be accepted.\n605\nAssessment of Vibrations Generated by Structure Demolition Part I: Influences on Surrounding Environment\nAuthors: Zhi Yi Chen, Hai Tao Yu, Yong Yuan\nAbstract: A triangular transfer hall is planned be built to distribute passenger flow rationally and improve multi-line transfer capability in the city of Shanghai, China. A large-scale reinforced-concrete bracing system, which is established to ensure the stability of the foundation pit, will be demolished with the completion of foundation pit. The influences of construction vibration on the surrounding environment are concerned. An evaluation method, which is generally applied to the ground vibrations caused by operation of machines, road and railway traffic, and construction activities such as piling and blasting, is then extended to assess the ground vibrations generated by structure demolition. It is found that the ground vibrations generated by demolition construction will affect the environment and human activities if without any vibration control measures.\n5325\nAssessment of Vibrations Generated by Structure Demolition Part II: Influences on Structural Safety and Durability\nAuthors: Zhi Yi Chen, Hai Tao Yu, Yong Yuan\nAbstract: The main purpose of this paper is to evaluate the influences of construction vibration, which is generated by structure demolition, on the structural safety and stability. As presented in the companion paper, the influences of construction vibration on the surrounding environment were assessed. In this paper, another issue is concerned. For this purpose, field measurements are conducted on site. Then the obtained data, mainly the structural strain are analyzed by the presented evaluation method and compared to the allowable strength values suggested by the existing code. It is found that the ground vibrations generated by demolition construction will not cause harmful effects on the structures.\n5329\nDynamical Behavior of Milling Machine Spindle\nAuthors: Marin Doina, Mihail Marin Dan\nAbstract: The spindle assembly is the most essential parts of the machine tool. The dynamic characteristics of the spindle assembly affect the performance of NC machine tool and for this reason should be studied. This paper presents a comparative analysis of theoretical and experimental dynamic behavior of no-load operation of a spindle for a vertical milling machine. Research has been conducted to highlight the natural vibrations mode and the directions that the system is more rigid.

"""Queen's_University_Belfast""","""Ranking Spatial and Temporal Hotspots for Road Safety Interventions Using a Nonlinear Aggregation Approach - Queen's University Belfast Research Portal - Research Directory & Institutional Repository for QUB""","""Ranking Spatial and Temporal Hotspots for Road Safety Interventions Using a Nonlinear Aggregation Approach\nResearch output: Contribution to conference › Paper\nPublished\nView graph of relations\nIn recent years, the concept of a composite performance index, brought from economic and business statistics, has gained popularity in the field of road safety. The construction of the Composite Safety Performance Index (CSPI) involves the following key steps: the selection of the most appropriate indicators to be aggregated and the method used to aggregate them.\nOver the last decade, various aggregation methods for estimating the CSPI have been suggested in the literature. However, recent studies indicates that most of these methods suffer from many deficiencies at both the theoretical and operational level; these include the correlation and compensability between indicators, as well as their high “degree of freedom” which enables one to readily manipulate them to produce desired outcomes.\nThe purpose of this study is to introduce an alternative aggregation method for the estimation of the CSPI, which is free from the aforementioned deficiencies. In contrast with the current aggregation methods, which generally use linear combinations of road safety indicators to estimate a CSPI, the approach advocated in this study is based on non-linear combinations of indicators and can be summarized into the following two main steps: the pairwise comparison of road safety indicators and the development of marginal and composite road safety performance functions. The introduced method has been successfully applied to identify and rank temporal and spatial hotspots for Northern Ireland, using road traffic collision data recorded in the UK STATs19 database. The obtained results highlight the promising features of the proposed approach including its stability and consistency, which enables significantly reduced deficiencies associated with the current aggregation methods. Progressively, the introduced method could evolve into an intelligent support system for road safety assessment.\nOriginal language\n""","0.6912949","""http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/ranking-spatial-and-temporal-hotspots-for-road-safety-interventions-using-a-nonlinear-aggregation-approach(ed487a45-05e0-4cf6-aae9-343b07517bcf).html""","[-5.934759,54.583863]"

NEJM ( 1 )\nReviewed by Sabi Hippolyte\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is due to genetic mutations resulting in deficient or dysfunctional CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Phe508del is the most common mutation, leading to protein misfolding and failure of trafficking to the cell surface; approximately 45% of the global CF population is homozygous for this mutation. Lumacaftor is a CFTR corrector (increasing the amount of protein localized to the cell surface). Ivacaftor is an approved CFTR potentiator (increasing the duration for which CFTR channels are open). In combination, there is a suggestion that CFTR activity can be increased sufficiently to improve clinical outcomes for Phe508del CFTR mutation homozygotes ( 2 ).\nThese two virtually identical phase 3 trials (TRAFFIC [A Study of Lumacaftor in Combination with Ivacaftor in Cystic Fibrosis Subjects Aged 12 Years and Older Who Are Homozygous for the F508del-CFTR Mutation] and TRANSPORT [A Study of Lumacaftor in Combination with Ivacaftor in Cystic Fibrosis Subjects Aged 12 Years and Older Who Are Homozygous for the F508del-CFTR Mutation]) were multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral lumacaftor/ivacaftor in combination for homozygous Phe508del mutation patients with CF of 12 years of age or older with FEV1 40–90% predicted at screening. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to: 600 mg lumacaftor once daily/250 mg ivacaftor twice daily (bd); 400 mg lumacaftor bd/250 mg ivacaftor bd; or placebo bd. A total of 1,122 were randomized, 559 in TRAFFIC, 563 in TRANSPORT.\nThe primary end point was absolute change from baseline at Week 24 in FEV1%. Secondary end points included the absolute change in body mass index (BMI) and patient-reported CF Questionnaire–Revised respiratory domain scores and the number of pulmonary exacerbations.\nThe groups were well matched at baseline with a mean FEV1 of 61% predicted, mean BMI of 21 kg/m2, mean age of 25 years, and similar rates of standard CF therapies. A significant treatment effect was seen for FEV1 in both active arms versus placebo (absolute difference, 2.6–4%, P < 0.001; relative difference, 4.3–6.7%, P < 0.001).\nThe rate ratio of pulmonary exacerbations was significantly different, with pooled analysis showing a 39% lower exacerbation rate in the 400 mg bd lumacaftor group and a 30% reduced rate in the 600 mg once daily lumacaftor group compared with placebo (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively).\nAt Week 24, the pooled analysis showed an absolute change in BMI of 0.24–0.28 kg/m2 (P < 0.001) in treatment versus placebo (although the TRAFFIC study alone did not show a significant difference in BMI change). Despite numerical increases in CF Questionnaire–Revised respiratory domain score, this was only significant in the 600 mg/d lumacaftor group and did not reach the clinically important threshold of a 4-point difference.\nAdverse events were similar across treatment (17.3–22.8%) and placebo (28.6%) arms. The percentage of patients who discontinued the study because of an adverse event was 1.6% in the placebo arm versus 4.2% in treatment groups. In the treatment groups, discontinuation was due to elevated creatinine kinase, hemoptysis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pulmonary exacerbation, or rash. Adverse events were largely respiratory (bronchospasm/dyspnea), and in those who did not discontinue the study, symptoms resolved within 2–3 weeks; the frequency of this was higher in the treated groups, although the mechanism underlying it remains unclear. A total of 5.1% placebo and 5.2% treatment groups had elevation of transaminases by more than three times the upper limit of normal. However, this was only classed as severe in the treatment group, of which six out of seven returned to baseline on discontinuing or interrupting treatment.\nThe clinical benefit for lumacaftor–ivacaftor in combination is greater than that previously observed with either agent alone and was sustained for the duration of the studies. The dose regimens had similar efficacy and safety profiles. However, although these trials offer an encouraging proof of principle, the benefits in terms of lung function are more modest than those seen for ivacaftor alone in class III mutations. It is hoped, although not yet demonstrated in this group, that CFTR modulation will also slow the rate of decline of lung function. Given the association between chronic loss of lung function and exacerbation frequency, the reduction in the latter in these trials is promising and may increase the impact of the therapy in the longer term.\nReferences\n1.\nWainwright CE, Elborn JS, Ramsey BW, Marigowda G, Huang X, Cipolli M, Colombo C, Davies JC, De Boeck K, Flume PA, et al.; TRAFFIC Study Group; TRANSPORT Study Group.

A Randomized Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Phase 2 Trial of BIIL 284 BS (an LTB4 Receptor Antagonist) for the Treatment of Lung Disease in Children and Adults with Cystic Fibrosis. J Cyst Fibros ( 3 )\nReviewed by Rishi Pabary\nA hallmark of CF lung disease is persistent neutrophilic inflammation, triggered by successive bacterial infections, that leads to irreversible parenchymal destruction ( 4 ). Antiinflammatory strategies have previously been studied and, although long-term treatment with ibuprofen has been shown to slow disease progression in CF, it is not widely prescribed because of concerns about systemic side effects ( 5 ). Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant produced in response to stimuli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection; high levels are found in CF sputum and correlate with decline in lung function ( 6 ), so blockade could theoretically improve clinical outcomes.\nTo determine the therapeutic potential of oral BIIL 284 BS, an LTB4 receptor antagonist, Konstan and colleagues ( 3 ) conducted a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with CF aged 6 years or older with FEV1 between 25 and 85% of predicted values or FEV1 greater than 85% and current P. aeruginosa infection. All patients were defined as clinically stable in the 4 weeks before screening. Exclusion criteria were chronic Burkholderia infection and long-term treatment with systemic corticosteroids or high-dose ibuprofen. Patients were randomized to BIIL 284 BS or placebo and followed every 28 days for 24 weeks. Primary end points were change in FEV1% predicted and number of pulmonary exacerbations. Online safety data were monitored throughout the trial.\nBased on power of over 90% to detect 3% change in FEV1, enrollment of 600 patients was planned; however, the trial was halted early by the CF Foundation Data Safety Monitoring Board after a planned interim analysis, which revealed an increased frequency of respiratory serious adverse events in adults on active treatment compared with placebo controls (29.7 vs. 11.8%, P = 0.001); a similar, but nonsignificant, trend was also seen in pediatric patients. In final analysis, pulmonary exacerbations were higher in adults on the study drug (33.1 vs. 18.2%, P = 0.005) with a significant difference in Kaplan-Meier curves for time to exacerbation between treatment groups (P = 0.002). Clinical efficacy could not be fully assessed owing to early termination, but there was a trend toward poorer average FEV1 in both adults and children receiving BILI 284 BS compared with placebo.\nSafety and modest efficacy of BIIL 284 BS has previously been reported in human trials of patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( 7 ), and reduction of neutrophilic inflammation by targeting LTB4 has been demonstrated in animal models of P. aeruginosa infection ( 8 ). However, reducing neutrophil activity in the CF lung by blockade of LTB4 receptors may facilitate bacterial proliferation. This was subsequently shown in a murine study in which animals infected with P. aeruginosa and treated with BIIL 284 BS had higher bacteraemia rates and pulmonary proinflammatory cytokine concentrations compared with those receiving placebo ( 9 ); the paradoxical rise in peripheral neutrophil counts that accompanied increased respiratory exacerbations in adults taking BIIL 284 BS compared with placebo in this study could be interpreted as an analog of this response.\nThe results of this trial highlight a potential pitfall in suppressing inflammatory responses in patients with a background of chronic infection; whereas insufficient antiinflammatory activity may render an agent ineffective, too potent a response may lead to infection-related safety concerns. The rigor demonstrated in the ongoing data collection, which allowed prompt recognition of this concern, underlines the importance of robust safety monitoring in clinical drug trials.\nReferences\n3.\nKonstan MW, Döring G, Heltshe SL, Lands LC, Hilliard KA, Koker P, Bhattacharya S, Staab A, Hamilton A; Investigators and Coordinators of BI Trial 543.45.

Ataluren for the Treatment of Nonsense-Mutation Cystic Fibrosis: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Trial. Lancet Respir Med ( 10 )\nReviewed by Michael Waller\nNonsense (class I) CFTR mutations are present in 10% of patients with CF and associated with severe CF lung disease. They are characterized by premature mRNA translational stop codons and result in truncated, nonfunctional CFTR protein with complete absence in the cell membrane. Ataluren is an oral, nonaminoglycoside compound, which allows ribosomal readthrough, thus producing a full-length, functional CFTR protein. Previous trials have demonstrated CFTR correction in vitro and with electrophysiological measures in a phase 2 clinical trial; small changes in lung function were also seen ( 11 , 12 ).\nThis well-designed multicenter, double-blind study randomized 238 patients (>6 yr with at least one nonsense mutation, and an FEV1% predicted 40–90%) to 48 weeks of ataluren or placebo (1:1). The primary end point was the relative change in FEV1% predicted from baseline; in vivo assessments of CFTR function (nasal potential difference and pilocarpine iontophoresis) were also performed.\nAt baseline, treatment groups were well matched, with a mean age of around 23 years and FEV1% predicted of 60–62%. At Week 48, a nonsignificant (P = 0.12) treatment effect was seen, with a mean difference in relative change FEV1 of 2.5% favoring ataluren treatment (ataluren, −2.53 vs. placebo, −5.50). No significant difference in the mean number of pulmonary exacerbations while on treatment was identified (ataluren, 1.42 vs. placebo, 1.78). No difference in CFTR-mediated chloride secretion from sweat or measured via nasal potential difference was seen between the two groups. Both treatment groups had a similar safety profile, other than increased serum creatinine concentrations occurring in 15% of the ataluren group, the most severe of which were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic antibiotics.\nIn a post hoc analysis, subgroups of patients receiving or not receiving long-term inhaled tobramycin (to treat chronic P. aeruginosa infection) were compared. Those not receiving inhaled tobramycin demonstrated a treatment difference of FEV1% predicted of 5.7% in favor of ataluren (ataluren, −0.7 vs. placebo, −6.4; P = 0.0082) and a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations (ataluren, 1.42 vs. placebo, 2.18; P = 0.018)); by contrast, no difference was observed in patients taking long-term tobramycin. Other inhaled antibiotics did not modify the effect on ataluren.\nThe authors performed post hoc in vitro assays and demonstrated that ataluren-induced readthrough of stop codons was reduced in the presence of tobramycin. As tobramycin acts through ribosomal binding, there is likely interaction with the ribosomal modulation mechanism of ataluren, thus abolishing its action.\nAlthough the trial failed to reach its primary end point or demonstrate key clinical improvements in the group as a whole, it is encouraging to see promising results from the tobramycin-naive subgroup. A phase 3 trial of ataluren in patients not receiving chronic inhaled tobramycin is currently in progress (clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov [NCT02139306]) to ascertain clinical benefit and establish disease modification. An interesting point regarding polypharmacy, so common in CF, is raised by this trial. Although clinical teams and trials themselves are often designed to detect safety issues related to interacting drugs or those with similar toxicity profiles, the impact of one drug on the efficacy of another has been less commonly studied. The recent publication by Nick and colleagues ( 13 ), reporting a similar issue in patients receiving long-term macrolide therapy, in whom the beneficial effect of nebulized tobramycin was abrogated, underscores the importance of such complex interactions, which will become increasingly common with the continued development of new therapies.\nReferences\n""","0.41103524","""http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1164/rccm.201509-1734RR""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

Current psychometry-based diagnostic methods are effective, but time-consuming and a universal ‘gold standard’ test has yet to be agreed upon. Critical Flicker Frequency (CFF) is a proposed language-independent diagnostic tool for MHE, but its accuracy has yet to be confirmed.\nAim\nTo assess the diagnostic accuracy of CFF for MHE by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies, which report on the diagnostic accuracy of this test.\nMethods\nA systematic literature search was performed to locate all publications reporting on the diagnostic accuracy of CFF for MHE. Data were extracted from 2 × 2 tables or calculated from reported accuracy data. Collated data were meta-analysed for sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and summary receiver operator curve (sROC) analysis. Prespecified subgroup analysis and meta-regression were also performed.\nResults\nNine studies with data for 622 patients were included. Summary sensitivity was 61% (95% CI: 55–67), specificity 79% (95% CI: 75–83) and DOR 10.9 (95% CI: 4.2–28.3). A symmetrical sROC gave an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.84 (SE = 0.06). The heterogeneity of the DOR was 74%.\nConclusions\nCritical Flicker Frequency has a high specificity and moderate sensitivity for diagnosing minimal hepatic encephalopathy. Given the advantages of language independence and being both simple to perform and interpret, we suggest the use of critical flicker frequency as an adjunct (but not replacement) to psychometric testing.\nUnited Kingdom National Institute for Health Research\nAlan Morement Memorial Fund\napt12199-sup-0002-FigS2.tif image/tif, 2464K\nFigure S2.

Several operating modes can be achieved by changing the on-off states of the switches in the front-end circuit. In generator driving mode, the battery bank is employed to elevate the phase voltage for fast excitation and demagnetization. In battery driving mode, the converter is reconfigured as a four-level converter, and the capacitor is used as an additional charge capacitor to produce multilevel voltage outputs, which enhances the torque capability. The operating modes of the proposed drive are explained and the phase current and voltage are analyzed in details. The battery charging is naturally achieved by the demagnetization current in motoring mode and by the regenerative current in braking mode. Moreover, the battery can be charged by the external AC source or generator through the proposed converter when the vehicle is in standstill condition. The SRM-based PHEV can operate at different speeds by coordinating the power flow between the generator and battery. Simulation in MATLAB/Simulink and experiments on a three-phase 12/8 SRM confirm the effectiveness of the proposed converter topology.\nDocuments\nIntegrated multilevel converter for switched reluctance motor drives\nRights statement: © 2016 IEEE.

Assessment of outcomes was blinded. Analysis was on an intention to treat basis.\nResults There was no significant difference in the change in asthma control or self efficacy between the two groups (ACQ: mean change 0.75 in mobile group v 0.73 in paper group, mean difference in change −0.02 (95% confidence interval −0.23 to 0.19); KASE-AQ score: mean change −4.4 v −2.4, mean difference 2.0 (−0.3 to 4.2)). The numbers of patients who had acute exacerbations, steroid courses, and unscheduled consultations were similar in both groups, with similar healthcare costs. Overall, the mobile phone service was more expensive because of the expenses of telemonitoring.\nConclusions Mobile technology does not improve asthma control or increase self efficacy compared with paper based monitoring when both groups received clinical care to guidelines standards. The mobile technology was not cost effective.\nTrial registration Clinical Trials NCT00512837 .\nIntroduction\nGlobally, an estimated 300 million people have asthma, presenting a considerable and increasing burden of disease to healthcare systems, families, and patients. 1 Despite two decades of asthma guidelines, 2 asthma remains poorly controlled in a substantial proportion of people. 3 Structured asthma management—which in the United Kingdom is predominantly delivered in primary care 4 —can improve outcomes in terms of exacerbations, admissions to hospital, and days lost from school and work. 5 The concept of supported self management, engaging both clinicians and patients in delivering and implementing regular monitoring of control and adjustment of treatment, is a key recommendation of national and international guidelines. 6 7 The theoretical model developed by Glasziou and colleagues, using asthma as an exemplar, describes the complementary and evolving roles of periodic support from professionals and ongoing self monitoring by patients. 8 Our recent qualitative study suggests that people with asthma perceive a role for mobile technology in aiding transition from clinician supported phases while control is gained to effective self management during maintenance phases. 9\nPoor adherence to monitoring and drugs is a potentially modifiable factor associated with poor control. 10 In contrast with paper diary monitoring, in which as few as 6% of readings might be recorded, 11 trials with electronic recording devices have shown rates of compliance of over 60%, 12 especially if the patient is aware that their health behaviour is being observed. 13 Timely feedback of results to the patient can objectively show severity of symptoms and the impact of compliance with drug treatment. Mobile phones, the most pervasive and accessible form of technology globally, 14 offer a highly convenient system for self monitoring coupled with instantaneous feedback, potentially engaging the patient in the monitoring and management of their asthma.\nSet within the Medical Research Council’s framework for the design and evaluation of complex interventions, 15 16 our phase III trial was underpinned by preliminary work that suggested that mobile phone based self monitoring of asthma care was feasible to deliver and acceptable to both patients and clinicians. 9 12 17 We hypothesised that, in adolescents and adults with poorly controlled asthma offered treatment according to the British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (BTS-SIGN) asthma guideline, 6 the use of mobile phone based monitoring of lung function and symptoms with feedback to patients would improve both control of asthma and patient self efficacy at six months compared with paper based monitoring strategies.\nMethods\nOur multicentre, investigator blinded randomised controlled trial was conducted in UK primary care in 2008-9. A detailed protocol has been published elsewhere 18 ; we made no important changes to our methods during the trial.\nPractice recruitment\nThe primary care research networks in Norfolk and Yarmouth, East Kent, North of England, and Essex and Hertfordshire identified and recruited practices.\nParticipants\nWe recruited patients aged 12 and over who were registered with participating practices, had poorly controlled asthma (defined as score ≥1.5 on asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) 19 ), and had, or were willing to borrow, a compatible mobile phone handset and a contract with a compatible network. We excluded people who had other lung disease, were unable to communicate in English, or were receiving specialist care for severe/difficult asthma, and those whose general practitioner advised against inclusion for major social/clinical problems.\nRecruitment of patients\nWe searched practice computer databases to identify potentially eligible patients. After the GP had screened the computer lists, we sent postal invitations to all eligible patients, with up to one written reminder.\nOne researcher (SDM or SM) prescreened respondents by telephone to determine whether they fulfilled the criterion of poorly controlled asthma and whether they had a contract with a compatible mobile phone network and a compatible handset. Patients with an incompatible handset but who subscribed to a compatible network were offered the opportunity of borrowing a handset for the duration of the trial.\nPotential participants attended a baseline assessment visit in their general practice at which they were provided with further information about the trial, eligibility was confirmed with the seven question version of the ACQ (which includes FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second) in addition to the six questions described below as a primary outcome measure), and written consent was obtained. All consenting patients who met the eligibility criteria were enrolled into the trial.\nPrimary outcome measures\nAsthma control questionnaire (ACQ)—The primary outcome measure was the change in asthma control between baseline and six months as measured by ACQ (six question version). 20 21 The ACQ measures clinical goals of asthma management on a scale of 0 (good control) to 6 (poor control), is responsive to change, 20 and has a minimum important difference within individuals of 0.5. 22 Postal administration gives comparable results with supervised completion. 23\nKnowledge, attitude, and self efficacy asthma questionnaire (KASE-AQ)—Self efficacy was measured as the change in KASE-AQ between the intervention and control groups at six months. The KASE-AQ has three independently scored subscales of 20 items of which we used two: “self efficacy,” which measures perceived ability to control asthma, and “attitude to asthma.” 24 Scores range from 20 (minimum score) to 100 and are responsive to change. 25 We omitted the outdated knowledge subscale.\nSecondary outcome measures\nFull details of the secondary outcome measures of interest are in the published protocol. 15 Briefly, we included:\nMini-asthma quality of life questionnaire (mini-AQLQ): score from 1 (greatest impairment) to 7, with a minimum important difference of 0.5 26\nAdverse occurrences obtained from the practice records, including admissions for exacerbations of asthma (defined as acute deteriorations of asthma for which the patient sought medical advice), prescribed courses of oral steroids, and unscheduled consultations\nPrescriptions of asthma drugs recorded in the patients’ healthcare record\nModified patient enablement instrument (mPEI): scale of 0 to 12 (most enabled) 27\nEngagement with process (proportion of patients defaulting from clinical follow-up).\nBaseline assessment\nWe undertook a baseline assessment comprising history of asthma, current smoking status, presence of comorbidity, and FEV1 with a Piko meter (nSpire Health, Enfield, UK). The use of the Piko meter to record peak flows was demonstrated and a meter given to the patient for use throughout the trial. The ACQ, KASE-AQ, mini-AQLQ, and mPEI questionnaires were self completed under supervision.\nRandomisation and protection against bias\nAll consenting participants were stratified by practice and centrally randomised (Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen) to mobile phone or paper based monitoring with a 1:1 allocation with random block sizes of two or four; telephone randomisation ensured concealment until the treatment was assigned. The practice nurse informed the patient of allocation to ensure the researchers were blinded to allocation throughout data collection and analysis.\nMobile phone monitoring\nThe practice nurse forwarded contact details of patients allocated to the intervention (mobile) group to OBS Medical (Abingdon, UK), who contacted the patient at a time convenient to them (normally within a week), downloaded the t+ Asthma application (fig 1 ⇓ ) onto their (or a loaned) phone, tested its functionality, trained the patient in its use, provided details of web access, and followed up with a technical support call after one week of use.\nFig 1 Mobile phone monitoring system.  t+ Asthma application, running on web enabled handset, allowed patient to record symptoms, drug use, and peak flow from Piko meter. Automated display plotted peak flow as normal (≥80% green zone), in need of attention (60-79% amber zone), or in need of urgent action (<60% red zone) and prompted patients to follow their agreed action plan. Incursion into red or amber zones also triggered contact by t+ Asthma nurse from OBS Medical on next working day to ascertain what had happened and what learning points had arisen. Data were automatically transmitted to secure website on remote server hosted by OBS Medical, every time application was used by patient. Patient and clinician were able to access patient data record via password protected website, which also provided general information about asthma\nDownload powerpoint\nThe t+ Asthma application enabled twice daily recording and transmission of symptoms, drug use, and peak flow. The mean of the five best peak flow values in the first 50 readings (after discarding the lowest five and highest five readings, which preliminary work suggested were often outliers 28 ) was taken to be the target peak flow value (100%) and used to define the 80% and 60% thresholds for a traffic light display. As new data were generated, the target peak flow value was adjusted to the mean of the five best peak flow values (after discarding outliers) in the most recent 50 readings. The recorded peak flow was displayed within the traffic light zones and the patient was prompted to follow their agreed action plan (fig 1 ⇑ ). Incursion into the red or amber zones triggered contact by an asthma nurse from OBS Medical on the next working day. Appendix 1on bmj.com gives the protocol for these support calls. Both the patient and their clinician were able to access the patient data record via a password protected website.\nPaper based monitoring\nPatients in the control (paper) group were asked to keep a paper diary, recording the same data as the intervention group (symptoms, drug use, and peak flow readings) twice daily.\nClinical care in both groups\nTo ensure that our trial specifically tested the impact of the technology, we opted to provide the paper group with the same clinical care as the intervention group, rather than using (probably less intensive) usual care as a comparator. Before randomisation, the practice asthma nurse delivered a 30 minute standardised education session encompassing information on asthma, asthma treatment, inhaler technique, monitoring, and a personalised asthma action plan based on both symptoms and peak flows completed in accordance with the advice of the BTS-SIGN asthma guideline. Instruction on mobile or paper monitoring was provided after randomisation according to allocation.\nThroughout the trial the practices’ asthma nurse provided clinical care in accordance with the stepwise approach advocated by the BTS-SIGN asthma guideline. 6 Patients were reviewed monthly (including the option of telephone reviews according to preference and clinical condition) until the nurse judged that control was achieved on the basis of clinical monitoring. Recognition of control in the context of a clinical review was discussed during the training. 29 When control was attained, the patient was discharged from monthly follow-up but was encouraged to continue monitoring on a maintenance basis, seeking professional advice if needed.\nData collection\nA researcher blinded to allocation collected primary outcome data at the final trial visit; non-attendees were sent the questionnaires by post. Interim data were collected by postal questionnaires at three months. The practice asthma nurses recorded the duration of each review at the end of the consultation and noted whether the patient’s asthma was now controlled and whether a further appointment was needed. The researcher extracted data on adverse events (including admissions, unscheduled asthma consultations), asthma treatment categorised by BTS-SIGN guideline step, 6 and use of healthcare resources over the six month trial period from the primary care records at baseline and at the end of the trial. Questionnaire data were scanned on the trial database. Data from records and other trial data were entered manually.\nSample size calculations\nUsing an estimated standard deviation of change in ACQ score of 0.25, 19 we estimated that a sample size of 125 per arm would have 90% power with a two sided 5% significance level to detect a difference in mean change in ACQ score of 0.1 or more between groups. With a standard deviation of 13.3, 25 a sample size of 39 in each arm would have 90% power with a two sided 5% significance level to detect a mean difference in mean KASE-AQ (self efficacy scale) score of 10 or more between groups.\nData analysis\nOur main analysis was on an intention to treat (ITT) basis. We assumed that participants who did not attend the three or six month assessment had not improved their control and their previous results were therefore carried forward. 30 A per protocol analysis was undertaken as a sensitivity analysis.\nAt baseline we described groups in terms of sociodemographic factors, history of asthma, ACQ, mini-AQLQ, KASE-AQ, and mPEI scores. We compared prespecified changes between groups from baseline in outcome measures using appropriate univariate techniques (t test, Mann-Whitney test). We used repeated measures analysis of variance, adjusted for age and sex, to examine trends over time in ACQ, mini-AQLQ, KASE-AQ, and mPEI scores both between and within groups. All two way interactions between outcome and age and sex were examined.\nWe compared the proportion of participants whose ACQ and mini-AQLQ score had improved by more than 0.5 (the minimum important difference), 31 the proportion in whom asthma remained poorly controlled (ACQ >1.5 19 ), and the proportion whose asthma was “well controlled” (ACQ <0.75 19 ) at six months.\nWe assessed costs from the perspective of the NHS. The total cost of the monitoring service for a projected maximum of 156 participants was allocated to each participant with the estimated reimbursed transmission costs. Costs were estimated by using unit costs obtained from standard sources 32 33 34 (see table A in appendix 2 on bmj.com for details). We used t tests to compare costs between groups.\nAll analyses were agreed a priori. We did not plan, or undertake, any interim analysis.\nResults\nRecruitment\nFigure 2 shows the flow of patients through the trial ⇓ . From 32 practices (total list size 311 926) computer searches identified a potentially eligible population of 13 101 (mean (SD) age 48.2 (17.9): 63% female), of whom 1020 were excluded by their practice. A total of 12 081 postal invitations were issued: 1016 people (8.4%) expressed an interest in participating and were prescreened for eligibility (poor control and compatible mobile phone and network). The 393 potentially eligible patients were invited to attend the baseline assessment and 288 gave informed consent and were randomised: 145 to the mobile group and 143 to the paper group. Ten people had missing or incomplete ACQ scores at baseline and were excluded after randomisation, leaving 139 patients in each group for the intention to treat analysis.\nFig 2 Flow of patients through trial of mobile phone and paper based monitoring of asthma control (ACQ=asthma control questionnaire; KASE-AQ= knowledge, attitude, and self efficacy asthma questionnaire; COPD=chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ITT=intention to treat)\nDiscussion\nSummary of main findings\nThe use of mobile phone technology did not significantly improve clinical outcomes, or increase self efficacy, compared with paper based monitoring when delivered in the context of guideline standard clinical care for the management of asthma. Healthcare costs were similar in both groups, with the telemonitoring expenses being an additional cost in the mobile group.\nStrengths and limitations\nWe exceeded our estimated sample size for the intention to treat analysis, though not for the per protocol sensitivity analysis. The results, however, are consistent, and it is unlikely that a smaller attrition rate would alter our conclusions. Our a priori basis of carrying the previous result forward 18 assumes that non-responders did not improve their control, which probably underestimates the degree of change in both groups.\nThe low recruitment rate (2.4% of those invited) reflects both the low response rate (8.4% of those invited) and our requirement that participants should have poorly controlled asthma and a compatible mobile phone system. A slightly higher proportion of the participants was female, compared with the potentially eligible population. The 10 patients excluded after randomisation because of missing baseline ACQ scores were distributed between the two arms (four in the mobile group, six in the paper group), and were recruited from eight different practices, reducing the risk that this introduced important bias.\nOur multicentre trial was conducted in primary care, the setting for most asthma care in the UK, and included both an intention to treat analysis and a per protocol sensitivity analysis. We built on extensive formative work, which underpinned the hypothesis and informed the practical design of the intervention and the outcomes measured. 9 12 17 23 Although the patients and nurses were clearly aware of the mode of monitoring that they were using, our trial procedures ensured that the researchers who undertook data collection and the trial statisticians were blinded to allocation (for example, randomisation was undertaken by the practice nurses, technical issues were dealt with by OBS Medical, patients were instructed not to reveal allocation, in the event of an inadvertent breach a second researcher attended the practice for subsequent data collection).\nInterpretation with reference to other research\nOur findings exemplify the challenges of evaluating complex eHealth interventions 35 and the concern that potential benefits have thus far tended not to be substantiated by subsequent empirical evidence. 36 Some studies using mobile phones 37 and internet based monitoring have shown benefit in adults 38 39 and children 40 when compared with “usual care.” Usual care, however, is likely to be considerably less intensive than that experienced by intervention groups, so that it is often impossible to determine whether the observed benefits in these trials were because of the enhanced clinical care or the technological intervention. To overcome this, we provided the same structured clinical and educational intervention in both groups and showed that when the only difference is the mode of monitoring and associated feedback, the link with mobile phone technology had no significant effect.\nOur hypothesis, building on formative work, 9 12 13 17 was predicated on the theory that using a mobile phone to monitor and receive instantaneous feedback on their asthma control would help patients to integrate management into everyday life, engage them more fully in their care, and thus potentially improve asthma control. Patients in both groups, however, attended a similar number of monthly clinical reviews, suggesting that the mobile phone monitoring did not improve compliance with care. Similarly, most patients in both groups stepped up their treatment during the course of the trial. Participation in the trial probably resulted in greater engagement of patients and asthma nurses in both groups with “guideline standard care” (as opposed to “usual care”), potentially contributing to the improvement we observed in both groups. Spontaneous improvement over the timescale of the trial is another plausible explanation.\nDespite the significant improvements in ACQ score in both groups, only about a fifth achieved the well controlled threshold of ACQ=0.75. While it has been shown that even better control can be achieved in trials with maximal doses of drugs in selected patients with asthma, 41 the degree of improvement we observed is of the same order as that shown in “real life” trials, 42 in which adherence is variable and comorbidity is common. To increase generalisability, we did not exclude smokers so some overlap with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is possible.\nThe cost of the t+ asthma service was additional to the health service costs, which were otherwise similar in both groups, making it the more expensive option. This might not extrapolate directly to normal clinical practice where, for example, economies of scale in a regional service could reduce the cost per patient. In addition, many other factors will affect both costs and benefits. Technological advances, such as smart phone applications, will increase functionality and widespread adoption might drive down costs. As part of the commercial arrangement with OBS Medical additional clinical support was available to the mobile group from the t+ asthma nurse, though its contribution is unclear as it was not a closely monitored component of the trial.\nA recent systematic review concluded that telehealthcare in asthma could have a role in reducing hospital admissions in high risk patients and in those with severe disease, 43 and some studies have suggested that those with poorly controlled asthma might be more ready to comply with novel monitoring 44 or take regular drug treatment 45 than those with already well controlled asthma. Our trial, which recruited people with poorer control and lower baseline spirometry results than other trials, 38 39 did not find a beneficial effect in this group.\nConclusions and implications\nIn people with poorly controlled asthma, the mobile phone based model of monitoring did not offer any advantages over and above paper based care when guideline standard clinical support services were provided to both groups. While mobile phone technology will appeal to some people, 17 18 it is not the crucial ingredient and carries cost implications. Its place in clinical care might depend on whether it is a cost effective option for enhancing “usual care” to the standards recommended by guidelines. 46 Policymakers internationally should consider the findings from this multicentre trial when considering the merits of investment in models of asthma care based on telehealthcare.\nWhat is already known on this topic\nMobile phones offer a highly convenient system for self monitoring coupled with instantaneous feedback, potentially engaging patients in the monitoring and self management of their asthma\nSome interventions using mobile phones in asthma care have shown benefit compared with “usual care,” but it is often impossible to determine whether the observed benefits were because of the mobile phone intervention or the associated enhanced clinical care\nWhat this study adds\nThe mobile phone based model of monitoring did not offer any clinical advantages over and above paper based care when guideline standard clinical support services were provided to both groups\nClinically relevant improvements were seen in both groups, suggesting that the telemonitoring was not the crucial ingredient in improving outcomes\nThe mobile phone based model of asthma care was more expensive than paper based model\nNotes\nCite this as: BMJ 2012;344:e1756\nFootnotes\nWe thank the officers of the primary care research networks for supporting practice recruitment, the practices, practice nurses, and administrative staff for their active participation, and the patients who gave their time to participate in the trial.

The measured quantities, if opportunely chosen, allow to follow the evolution of the structural behavior in the lifetime and to recognize the occurrence of damages. Hence the collected data can be considered as symptoms and used to assess the reliability and the prognosis of the monitored structure. This paper presents the application of symptom-based reliability formulation to a real case study: a set of precast bonded post-tensioned concrete bridge beams, recently dismounted  after a service life of 50 years. Both static and dynamic tests were carried out at the aim of evaluating the residual load-bearing capacity and investigating the effects of deterioration on their dynamic properties. The experimental results of test campaigns have been used as symptoms in order to estimate the reliability function of the beams and the evolution of their resistance in time.\nInfo:\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.569-570.358\nCitation:\nA.

The approaches of testing the flexural behavior of 6 recycled course aggregate beams with the same section size, different replacement ratio of recycled coarse aggregate (0%, 50%, 70% and 100%) and different percentage reinforcement (0.68%, 0.89% and 1.13%). Based on the experimental the following conclusions are draw. There are also 4 phases of elasticity, cracking, yield and ultimate during the stress course of recycled concrete beam component normal section stress; the average strain measured on cross-section obliges to the plane section assumption; the characteristics of stress distortion and destruction of recycled concrete beam are basically the same as those of the normal concrete beam. Under same conditions, the cracking moment and the ultimate flexural carrying capability of recycled concrete beam is almost the same as those of normal concrete beam. The deformation of recycled concrete beam is larger than concrete beam. The conclusion of the paper is that it is still feasible to calculate the ultimate bending moment, cracking moment, and the biggest crack width of recycled concrete beam according to the formula in China Concrete Structure Design Code, but the deflection formula needs to be adjusted.\n543\nExperimental Study on Precracked RC Beams Strengthened with Externally Bonded CFRP Sheets\nAuthors: Jiang Feng Dong, Qing Yuan Wang, Yan Mei Zhu\nAbstract: This paper presents the results of an experimental research work designed to study the flexural strengthening capacity and the modes of failure of Reinforced Concrete (RC) rectangular beams which are strengthened with external bonding of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite materials to the tensile face of the RC beams. In total, seven beams were cast, one beam was preserved as control beam, two beams were strengthened without the application of preloading and the four beams were precracked and repaired with CFRP sheets. The main experimental parameters include the original damaged degree of RC beams, the amount of CFRP sheets, the longitudinal tensile reinforcement ratio, shear span to effective depth ratio, and the concrete cover thickness. All beams were tested in four-point bending over a span of 1500mm. Test results in the current study indicate that the effectiveness and flexural capacity of the CFRP strengthened beams. The flexure enhancement of the CFRP strengthened beams varied between 41% and 125% over the control beam. This study confirms that the CFRP sheets technique significantly enhances the flexural capacity of reinforced concrete beams. Finally, the contribution of CFRP sheets on the flexural capacity and rigidity of precracked and non-precracked RC beams is significant for the more longitudinal tensile reinforcement ratio.\n842\nExperimental Research on Flexural Performance of Prestressed Composite Beam with Partial Shear Connection\nAuthors: Xiang Fei Ye, Shao Wei Hu\nAbstract: In order to research that how the degree of shear connection influence the static properties of composite beams such as the relative slip on the interface、bearing capacity and failure mode, four prestressed composite beams with different the degree of shear connection were designed, and were loaded on the two symmetric position. The paper described and analyzed the bending behaviors of prestressed composite beam such as the strain distribution of sections、interface slip、deformation and failure patterns on the base of the experimental results. In addition, the paper revised the calculating formulas of the ultimate bending capacity of composite beams with partial shear connection in Eurocode 4 with the least square method combined with test results of domestic and overseas about seven composite beams. The results showed that the correction values were corresponding well with experimental data and the engineering accuracy.\n596\nFlexural Behavior of Innovative Hybrid GFRP-Reinforced Concrete Beams\nAuthors: Xian Li, Heng Lin Lv, Shu Chun Zhou\nAbstract: Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars are emerging as a competitive option for replacing steel bars as reinforcement in various concrete structures exposed to aggressive environments. However, the low elastic modulus and brittleness of FRP bars significantly reduce the stiffness and the ductility of FRP-reinforced concrete (FRP-RC) members. In order to improve the flexural behavior of FRP-RC members and meanwhile ensure their satisfactory corrosion-resistant performance, an innovative FRP-reinforced concrete encased steel composite (FRP-RCS) member, which consists of ductile structural steel shapes in combination with corrosion-resistant FRP-reinforced concrete, was conceived and studied. An experimental investigation on the flexural behavior of the proposed FRP-RCS beams was conducted by testing a total of five large-scale simply supported beam specimens subjected to four-point bending loads. The test specimens included one FRP-RC beam reinforced with GFRP bars only and four FRP-RCS beams reinforced with both GFRP bars and encased structural steel shapes. The main parameters considered in this study were concrete compressive strength and amounts of GFRP reinforcement. The test results indicated that using encased steel shapes provided a significant enhancement in load carrying capacity, stiffness, ductility and energy absorption capacity of test beams. The tested FRP-RC beam suffered a brittle failure caused by sudden fracture of tensile GFRP bars whereas the proposed FRP-RCS beams behaved in a ductile manner due to the beneficial residual strength of encased steel shapes following concrete crushing. In addition, the experimental results also demonstrated that the concrete compressive strength had little effect on load carrying capacity of FRP-RCS beams whereas the load carrying capacity can be enhanced by increasing the reinforcement ratio. Analytical methods were also constructed using OpenSEES2.2.2 to simulate the load-deflection response of tested beams..\n850\nExperimental Study on Flexural Property of Reinforced Concrete Beams with Recycled Aggregate of Construction Waste\nAuthors: Zhao Hua Du, Tong Hao, Li Xin Liu\nAbstract: This paper presents the test results of 6 reinforced concrete beams with recycled aggregates of construction waste under flexure, the beams were made of two strength grade concrete of and with different recycled aggregate replacement rate. The results indicate: the ultimate bearing capacity of recycled concrete beams with natural aggregate concrete beams are almost the same, and can meet the requirements of chinese code; The cracking resistance of the reinforced recycled concrete beams is slightly less than that of the beams with natural aggregates, the influence of recycled aggregate replacement rate to cracking resistance is not obvious. Recycled concrete beam crack load the calculated value is greater than the measured value, should carry out the theoretical value adjustment. Reinforced concrete beams is one of concrete structures, its the most common and most important component, Study of flexural property of reinforced concrete for recycled concrete structure component in the popularization and application to have the important significance [. This paper presents the test results of 6 reinforced concrete beams with recycled aggregates of construction waste under flexure, the beams were made of two strength grade concrete of C30 and C40 and with different recycled aggregate replacement rate of 0%, 50% and 70%. These results may be as a reference for the application of the concrete with recycled aggregates of construction waste in engineering [2,3,.\n601\n""","0.19487497","""https://www.scientific.net/KEM.569-570.358""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

Similar electric vehicle targets have been introduced in other countries. However, reducing energy consumption and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions in transport is a considerable challenge due to heavy reliance on fossil fuels. In fact, transport in the Republic of Ireland in 2009 accounted for 29% of non-emissions trading scheme greenhouse gas emissions, 32% of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, 21% of total greenhouse gas emissions and approximately 50% of energy-related non-emission trading scheme greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper the effect of electric vehicle charging on the operation of the single wholesale electricity market for the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland is analysed. The energy consumed, greenhouse gas emissions generated and changes to the wholesale price of electricity under peak and off-peak charging scenarios are quantified and discussed. Results from the study show that off-peak charging is more beneficial than peak charging.\nLinks\n""","8.813648","""http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/an-analysis-of-the-effect-of-electric-vehicle-charging-on-the-operation-of-the-single-electricity-market(55546d45-53a3-47bf-a513-df92b534dedb).html""","[-5.934759,54.583863]"

The flexibility of an electric drivetrain would have a negative effect on the blended brake control performance. In this study, models of the powertrain system of an electric car equipped with an axle motor are developed. Based on these models, the transfer characteristics of the motor torque in the driveline and its effect on blended braking control performance are analysed. To further enhance a vehicle's brake performance and energy efficiency, blended braking control algorithms with compensation for the powertrain flexibility are proposed using an extended Kalman filter. These algorithms are simulated under normal deceleration braking. The results show that the brake performance and blended braking control accuracy of the vehicle are significantly enhanced by the newly proposed algorithms.\n""","0.45204243","""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00423114.2014.938663""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

Being introduced into the dynamic chassis control of electrified vehicles, the electric motor torque can be used not only for driving and regenerative braking during normal operating conditions, but also offers a great potential to improve the dynamic control performance of the anti-lock braking under emergency deceleration situations.This paper presents a robust control algorithm for anti-lock braking of a front-wheel-drive electric vehicle equipped with an axle motor. The hydraulic and regenerative braking system of the electric vehicle is modeled as a LPV (linear parameter varying) system. The nonlinearities of the control system are considered as uncertain parameters of a linear fractional transformation. A static-state feedback control algorithm which is robust against the uncertainties is designed to achieve the maximum braking capability of the vehicle. To validate the control performance of the proposed algorithm, simulations are carried out. Based on the simulation results, the proposed anti-lock braking control algorithm can achieve the good robustness and control performance under different road adhesion coefficients, guaranteeing the brake stability of the electric vehicle.\nEvent:\n""","11.688961","""http://papers.sae.org/2014-01-0140/""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

As an illustrative application, we use the methodology to explore the role of vehicle mix and vehicle prevalence on long-run fatality trends for a range of transportation growth scenarios that may be relevant to developing societies. We assume crash rates between different road users are proportional to their roadway use and estimate case fatality ratios (CFRs) for the different vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-pedestrian combinations. We find that in the absence of road safety interventions, the historical trend of initially rising and then falling fatalities observed in industrialized nations occurred only if motorization was through car ownership. In all other cases studied (scenarios dominated by scooter use, bus use, and mixed use), traffic fatalities rose monotonically. Fatalities per vehicle had a falling trend similar to that observed in historical data from industrialized nations. Regional adaptations of the model validated with local data can be used to evaluate the impacts of transportation planning and safety interventions, such as helmets, seat belts, and enforcement of traffic laws, on traffic fatalities.\nArticles related to the one you are viewing\nCiting Literature\nNumber of times cited: 18\n1\nGeetam Tiwari, Deepty Jain, Kalaga Ramachandra Rao, Impact of public transport and non-motorized transport infrastructure on travel mode shares, energy, emissions and safety: Case of Indian cities, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 2016, 44, 277\nCrossRef\n5\nHuan He, Nino Paichadze, Adnan A.

The former include rail traffic rules, infrastructure, rolling stock reliability, organizational safety culture, and human factors. The railway systems in Europe, North America, and Australasia have seen significant technological developments for improved capacity and efficiency. Europe, for instance, is implementing the European Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS). However, transition to a more automated traffic management system requires, among other things, changes to infrastructure, rolling stock, operational procedures, or all three. Concerning operational procedures, the literature shows that train drivers, signalers, and controllers have the greatest effect on the safety of a railway network. Therefore, the reliability and safety integrity of the railway network are largely dependent on human factors, in particular, the performance of human operators. This performance in turn is affected by a number of factors broadly known as performance-shaping factors (PSFs), with deficiencies in communication accounting for more than 90% of incidents for the conventional railway system. Therefore, this study investigated the influence of ERTMS and in particular the Global System for Mobile Communications-Railway (GSM-R) on operators' performance. The study analyzed 74 accident and incident reports of railway operations before and after GSM-R implementation from several European railway organizations. The results identified the communications-related factors that affected human performance in the conventional and upgraded railway system based on the existing railway-PSF taxonomy. Finally, the results showed the positive impact of GSM-R implementation on operators' performance.\n< >\nTransportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board\nTransportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board\nPrint ISSN: 0361-1981\n""","1.0055068","""http://trrjournalonline.trb.org/doi/10.3141/2374-10""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

Despite reports from numerous big cohorts, no single adult life factor, including smoking, accounts for this accelerated decline. By contrast, five childhood risk factors (maternal and paternal asthma, maternal smoking, childhood asthma and respiratory infections) are strongly associated with an accelerated rate of lung function decline and COPD. Among adverse effects on lung development are transgenerational (grandmaternal smoking), antenatal (exposure to tobacco and pollution), and early childhood (exposure to tobacco and pollution including pesticides) factors. Antenatal adverse events can operate by causing structural changes in the developing lung, causing low birth weight and prematurity and altered immunological responses. Also important are mode of delivery, early microbiological exposures, and multiple early atopic sensitizations. Early bronchial hyperresponsiveness, before any evidence of airway inflammation, is associated with adverse respiratory outcomes. Overlapping cohort studies established that spirometry tracks from the preschool years to late middle age, and those with COPD in the sixth decade already had the worst spirometry at age 10 years. Alveolar development is now believed to continue throughout somatic growth and is adversely impacted by early tobacco smoke exposure. Genetic factors are also important, with genes important in lung development and early wheezing also being implicated in COPD. The inescapable conclusion is that the roots of COPD are in early life, and COPD is a disease of childhood adverse factors interacting with genetic factors.\nKeywords:\nKeywords: atopy ; asthma ; nicotine ; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ; microbiome\nIn 1977, in a classic report, Fletcher and Peto ( 1 ) proposed a model (their Figure 1 ) in which all comers attained a normal FEV1 at age 25 years, and progression to respiratory disability was solely determined by rate of decline of spirometry thereafter. Smoking history was seen as the chief determinant of rate of decline, and events before age 25 years were irrelevant. In their far less well known, but far more accurate Figure 2, they incorporated different starting levels of FEV1 at age 25 years, as well as different rates of decline, into their model. These findings have been taken forward and have had to be substantially modified by a recent study combining three cohorts. This confirmed two trajectories to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or, strictly speaking, to an FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 70%. There were approximately equal numbers in each trajectory. Of those who failed to attain an FEV1 of 80% before age 40 years, 26% had developed COPD during the 22 years of observation, whereas 7% with a normal FEV1 aged 40 years developed COPD within the same time period due to an accelerated rate of decline in FEV1 ( 2 ). Critically, the rate of decline was unrelated to smoking, nor could the authors identify any current feature associated with rapid decline in spirometry. The only logical conclusion is that all COPD risk is determined before the age of 40 years, either genetically or by environmental adverse influences or their interactions ( Figure 1 ).\nFigure 1. Why adults get premature airway disease. Note that all the factors have origins in childhood; there is no consistent adult-onset feature identified in the literature.\n[More] [Minimize]\nThis conclusion is supported by a European study that identified five adverse childhood influences that were associated with a lower FEV1 and a more rapid rate of decline of spirometry (and, hence, a greater COPD risk in adult life) ( 3 ). These were maternal and paternal asthma, maternal smoking, and childhood asthma and severe respiratory infections. Childhood disadvantage was at least as important as heavy smoking. The focus is therefore on any adverse event increasing the likelihood of one or more of these disadvantages. The first lesson from normal lung growth for pediatricians is that by asking five simple questions (antenatally, asking the mother three simple questions) ( Table 1 ) ( 4 ), a population of children at high risk for later premature airflow obstruction can be identified. Second, any factor increasing the likelihood of the development of childhood asthma or an increased propensity to respiratory infection will contribute to accelerated lung aging. Gene polymorphisms, for example in a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 33 (ADAM33), have also been associated with accelerated decline in lung function ( 5 ) (see below). Finally, no adult life influence, including smoking, has consistently been associated with accelerated decline in spirometry. The conclusion is inescapable: both the two recently described trajectories to COPD ( 2 ) are determined before adult life, and, if COPD is to be prevented, measures starting in adult life are too late.\nTable 1. Simple key questions to identify children at high risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nAntenatally and postnatally\nDoes the child have asthma?\nHas the child had severe respiratory infections?\nThe best description of the normal evolution of spirometry is from the Global Lung Initiative ( 6 ). The group used 97,759 measurements in healthy nonsmokers from 72 centers in 33 countries aged between 2.5 and 95 years to construct predictive equations for spirometry. From their smooth curves, three key stages emerge: for normal lung health, spirometry needs to be normal at first measurement (now best described by the raised volume, rapid thoracic compression technique at birth [ 7 ], or preschool standard spirometry [ 8 ], stage 1), needs to grow normally in childhood to attain a normal plateau at age 20 to 25 years (stage 2), and declines with aging at a normal rate (stage 3). Key influences on these stages are discussed in turn. Finally, new data challenging the concepts of normal alveolar growth are presented. Space allows only a summary of many factors leading to childhood asthma and respiratory infections.\nKey Stage 1: Before Birth\nSection:\nThe morphological phases of lung development in utero have been well described; airway caliber is determined largely in the second half of pregnancy. Recently, the gene expression studies of normal lung development have been determined ( 9 ) and have broadly confirmed the utility of the morphological stages. The complexities of the pathways of branching morphogenesis have been reviewed ( 10 , 11 ) and will not be discussed further, except insofar as they lead to important genetic clues into lung aging.\nPreconception adverse events may impact the fetus. Grandmaternal smoking has a double-hit effect; it increases the risk of maternal asthma and, even if the mother herself does not smoke, increases the risk of her offspring having asthma ( 12 , 13 ).\nAntenatal adverse effects can be mediated through reducing airway caliber, altering fetal immune responses, inducing either or both prematurity and low birth weight, and influencing the mode of delivery. Many different antenatal adverse effects on lung growth have been described ( 14 ), including the effects of maternal stress on fetal immune responses ( 15 ), but most information is available for nicotine and tobacco smoke. These are worsened if mother or fetus have non-null GSTT1, highlighting the importance of gene–environment interactions ( 16 ). Recently, the adverse effects on early childhood spirometry of maternal exposure to environmental pollution have come to the fore ( 17 , 18 ), and, although the mechanisms are speculative, it is clear that early airflow obstruction is the result ( 19 ).\nMaternal hypertension of pregnancy has been described as causing airflow obstruction in the baby ( 20 ), but this has been disputed recently, with attention focusing on prepregnancy hypertension as being important ( 21 ). More studies are needed to confirm or otherwise the developmental role of maternal blood pressure on the baby.\nStructural Changes\nMost of the data have come from animal models of nicotine exposure of the pregnant dam. Antenatal changes described include increased collagen deposition ( 22 ), increased MUC5AC expression ( 23 ), and airway lengthening and reduction in caliber ( 24 ). The readout in the fetus is airway obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) at birth. Note that AHR occurs in the absence of allergen exposure (mice) and any evidence of airway inflammation (mice, infants [ 24 , 25 ]). The anatomical changes are likely also exacerbated by loss of alveolar tethering points ( 26 ) and increased airway smooth muscle thickness ( 27 )\nImmunological Changes\nThere are a large number of studies looking at the effects of pregnancy exposures on cord blood mononuclear cell function. Maternal smoking and previous pregnancies affect cord blood mononuclear cell proliferation to allergens ( 28 ). Abnormal cytokine responses at birth predict wheeze with viral infections in early life ( 29 ), including rhinovirus-induced wheeze, which is strongly associated with subsequent asthma ( 30 ). Maternal smoking is also associated with abnormal toll-like receptor function ( 31 ).\nBirth Weight, Low Birth Weight, and Prematurity\nA recent metaanalysis has shown that any cause of low birth weight is associated with subsequent childhood and adult asthma ( 32 ). The Aberdeen Birth cohort demonstrated a linear relationship between birth weight (adjusted for relevant maternal factors) and spirometry at age 45 to 50 years ( 33 ). Tobacco smoking is a well-known cause of preterm delivery, the risk of which is reduced by tobacco legislation ( 34 ). Very preterm infants are well known to be left with fixed and variable airflow obstruction, and, although outcomes are improving ( 35 ), even those preterm babies requiring no treatment in the newborn period have airflow limitation ( 36 ), so improvements in neonatal intensive care are unlikely to abolish the problem. The decrements in spirometry in bronchopulmonary dysplasia survivors are greater than those of healthy preterm infants ( 37 ). Furthermore, even modest degrees of prematurity (up to 37 weeks’ gestation) are associated with impaired spirometry in the late teenage years ( 38 ) and increased use of asthma medications in childhood ( 39 – 41 ). Low birth weight of itself is a risk factor for subsequent asthma ( 32 ). There may be a differential effect of low birth weight in babies who are small (SGA), as opposed to appropriate (AGA), weight for gestation age; at age 20 to 22 years, spirometry was strongly predicted by birth weight in the SGA but not the AGA group ( 42 ). It should be noted that, as protocols for resuscitation of the newborn ( 43 ) and subsequent ventilation ( 44 ) have changed, so have the different contributions of airway and parenchymal disease in “new” and “old” bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( 45 )\nMode of Delivery\nDelivery by caesarean section is associated with an increased risk of atopic disorders ( 46 , 47 ), probably mediated via an effect on the fetal microbiome ( 48 ). Especially if at least one parent is allergic, children delivered by caesarean section have a higher prevalence of asthma at age 8 years, and children of nonallergic parents were more likely to be sensitized ( 49 ). Because there are no randomized controlled trials of caesarean section delivery, it is not possible to disentangle the effects of caesarean delivery from the causes leading to the need for caesarean delivery.\nKey Stage 2: Childhood Lung Growth\nSection:\nLessons from the Birth Cohorts\nThe ideal study would have recruited babies antenatally and followed them through with repeated measurements until death; such a study has not been done, and so we have to rely on a series of overlapping cohorts ( 50 – 53 ), reviewed in Reference 54 . Although there are some discrepancies, the general message is that lung function at age 4 to 6 years is determined by lung function and bronchial hyperresponsiveness soon after birth, and thereafter tracks; hence, decrements at age 4 to 6 years are reflected in adult lung function, at least to age 50 years. There may be further deterioration at school age and beyond, but no improvements.\nThis view has recently been challenged, at least in the context of preterm survivors. A group of preterm babies at age 7 to 9 years had evidence of airflow obstruction, the degree of which related to the intensity of neonatal treatment, but this had normalized by age 20 to 22 years ( 42 ); interestingly, birth weight was a strong determinant of airflow obstruction in the SGA but not the AGA low birth weight babies. However, this difference was not found in another study ( 55 ). The differences might relate to the proportions of SGA and AGA babies in the different studies or the relative insensitivity of spirometry to distal airway disease. Overall, however, it is clear that the preschool years represent a critical window for long-term lung health.\nThe presence of AHR is important in long-term lung function and requires a developmental perspective. Three groups have measured neonatal AHR, and all showed significant relationships with long-term outcomes, albeit with slightly different results ( 56 – 60 ). The COPSAC (Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood) data ( 59 ) suggested that 40% of airway obstruction at age 7 years was determined antenatally and 60% postnatally; neonatal AHR was more strongly associated with asthma at age 7 years than neonatal lung function. It should be noted that neonatal AHR is not related to airway inflammation ( 25 ) and is presumably determined by anatomical factors (see above); thus, small airways increase resistance more for a given proportionate radius change because resistance is inversely related to the fourth power of the radius. Although AHR and lung function at birth were described as independent risk factors for childhood lung function ( 61 ), in reality abnormal anatomy is likely to underlie both. Finally, the longest-running study of AHR from birth to adult life showed that the adult relationship between AHR and asthma was established before age 6 years ( 62 ).\nTobacco and Nicotine\nThe effects of passive smoking were described in a series of metaanalyses ( 63 – 69 ), which have been recently updated ( 70 ); they are sufficiently well known that, in the interest of space, they will not be further discussed. Of interest, recent data showed that maternal smoking and the child taking up smoking have additive effects on the child’s lung function ( 71 ).\nPollution\nThe association of exposure to outdoor pollution postnatally with poorer lung function, asthma, respiratory infections, and a lower rate of growth of spirometry has been well described ( 72 – 74 ), but it may be difficult to disentangle the confounding effects of socioeconomic status. Recently, the beneficial effects of legislation leading to improved air quality on the growth of children’s lungs have been described ( 2 ). Globally, indoor exposure to burning biomass fuels may be most important, and measures to improve indoor air quality improve children’s lung function ( 75 ). Organophosphorus pesticides have recently been implicated as affecting child lung development ( 76 ).\nAsthma and Atopy\nEarly impairment of lung function is associated with objectively diagnosed asthma at age 10 years ( 77 ). It has long been known that early sensitization to aeroallergens is associated with persistent wheeze, loss of lung function, and the development of AHR ( 78 ). Understanding has advanced with the realization that atopy is not an all-or-none phenomenon but can be quantified ( 79 ) and has a developmental perspective. The Manchester group used machine learning approaches to analyze data on patterns of wheeze and atopic sensitization and showed that only multiple early sensitizations were important ( 80 ). In a subsequent study, they showed that persistent wheeze, early multiple atopic sensitizations, and asthma attacks are associated with reduced growth in lung function ( 81 ). Asthma itself is associated with poorer lung growth. As yet unexplained, in the CAMP (Childhood Asthma Management Program) study, approximately one-third of subjects lost percent predicted lung function over the study period, independent of prescribed treatment ( 82 ).\nEarly Viral Infections\nThat acute viral infections are important causes of early respiratory morbidity due to bronchiolitis and wheeze is indisputable. However, whether they cause asthma to develop in an infant who would otherwise not go on to the disease, or are a marker for an asthma propensity, or both, is controversial. It is clear from cord blood studies (see above) that there is antenatal programming favoring viral wheeze; a study from Perth showed that respiratory function was impaired before the development of bronchiolitis, and this decrement tracked into mid-childhood ( 83 ). Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis is a devastating illness, but studies as to whether it is causally associated with asthma are controversial ( 84 , 85 ). Recently, attention has focused on rhinovirus as being more associated with later asthma ( 30 ). The balance of evidence is that allergic sensitization precedes viral wheezing ( 86 ), and it is likely that sensitization rather than viral infections drive the march to asthma. However, this conclusion must still be considered tentative.\nMicrobiome\nThe role of bacteria in normal and abnormal immune development, as well as exacerbations of airway disease ( 87 ), has recently come to the fore. The lower airway is now known not to be sterile as was once believed ( 88 ). Early nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization is associated with altered immune responses ( 89 ), a greater likelihood of wheezing ( 90 ), and worse respiratory infective outcomes ( 91 )—therefore, a double hit at least hypothetically in accelerating lung aging subsequently. It is likely that the fundamental abnormality is an underlying mucosal immune defect, but this is still contentious. By contrast, environmental bacterial and fungal diversity is associated with a reduced risk of asthma ( 92 ). Animal studies have shown that the microbiome is essential for normal immune development ( 93 ), and interactions between allergens and the microbiome influence the body’s immune responses ( 94 , 95 ). The long-term effects of an abnormal microbiome on lung aging are currently unknown, but their influences on asthma risk mean that they are likely significant (see above).\nNutrition\nThere is evidence that an early and rapid gain in weight may be associated with poorer lung growth, in addition to the effects of low birth weight and SGA ( 96 ). However, paradoxically, greater weight gain in later childhood may be associated with better spirometry ( 97 ).\nKey Stage 3: The Aging Lung\nSection:\nThere has been much recent information that has increased our understanding of lung aging since Fletcher and Peto’s manuscript ( 2 , 98 – 101 ). In summary, it is clear that many patients with COPD have a normal rate of lung aging, and, indeed, those who fail to attain the normal plateau in early adult life are at the highest risk of COPD. Asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness are risk factors for accelerated decline, but no other environmental factor, including smoking, has consistently been implicated as a cause. The Framingham study reported traffic pollution as being important ( 102 ), but the caveats about socioeconomic status (see above) remain.\nThe role of asthma and AHR in accelerated decline in airway function is multifactorial. The combination of a preexisting low FEV1 and airway inflammation (as shown by elevation in fractional exhaled nitric oxide) is associated with accelerated decline ( 103 ), as are asthma attacks ( 104 ). The Groningen group showed that patients with asthma who stopped smoking and used inhaled corticosteroids had a slower rate of decline; AHR predicted decline independent of baseline FEV1 ( 105 ). However, the two are interrelated; they also showed that low childhood FEV1 and less increase over time was associated with adult AHR ( 106 )\nGenes, Lung Growth, and Lung Aging\nSection:\nGenetic factors, including gene-by-environment interactions via a variety of epigenetic mechanisms, are clearly important in lung development and aging. It is likely that a rich harvest of COPD genes will be found in normal lung development ( 107 ). There are substantial commonalities between genes causing reduced lung function in both smokers and nonsmokers ( 108 ). The conventional approaches have recently been taken forward by using systems genetic approaches ( 109 ).\nAntenatally Important Genes\nADAM33 is an exemplar gene with different roles at different developmental stages. It is important antenatally during airway branching morphogenesis ( 110 ). Levels in the fetus depend on maternal atopy, via an IL-13 pathway ( 111 ). There is an adverse interaction between antenatal tobacco exposure and ADAM33 polymorphisms and lung function at age 8 years ( 112 ). ADAM33 polymorphisms are associated with increased airway resistance in the preschool years ( 113 ), are associated with asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in adults ( 114 ), and those known to convey susceptibility to COPD were associated with an accelerated rate of decline in spirometry in a Dutch general population ( 5 ).\nGenes Important in Early Postnatal Life\nThe β-receptor gene links early lung function, asthma, and COPD. Much is known about β-receptor function in asthma, but very little is known about any possible role in infancy. Maximal flow at functional residual capacity and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) were measured soon after birth in infants; having any Glyn 27 or Arg 16 allele was associated with reduced maximal flow at functional residual capacity ( 1 ), independent of maternal smoking or atopic status, but BHR was independent of genotype. The patients were restudied at age 11 years, and β-receptor genotype had no association with either spirometry or BHR, possibly because of low statistical power. More than 80% of the children had at least one parent with asthma, so caution should be exercised before extrapolating to low-risk populations. In another study ( 115 ) there was an association between arg16 gln27 and a positive BHR at age 6 years. The gly16 gln27 haplotype was associated with better spirometry at 6 and 11 years of age and less likelihood of an asthma diagnosis at the later time point, but at age 11 years, arg16 gln27 was associated with worse spirometry. A further study found associations with β-receptor haplotypes in adults with COPD, asthma, and other respiratory problems ( 116 ). β-receptor polymorphisms also predicted symptoms of asthma continuing into adult life ( 117 ), but like other genetic studies, the association was weak. One study examined the genetics of preschool wheeze phenotypes and related them to COPD genes ( 118 ). They found that at least three COPD genes were involved in lung growth and development and were involved in antenatal and early life responses to tobacco smoke exposure. More recently, low circulating concentrations of the antiinflammatory protein CC16, which are known to be associated with an accelerated decline in FEV1 in patients with COPD ( 98 , 119 ), have also been found to be associated with accelerated decline in a general adult population and impaired childhood lung function ( 120 ).\nGenome-Wide Association Studies of Spirometry: Developmental Genes\nThere have been a large number of recent important genome-wide association studies both of normal lung function ( 121 – 123 ) and of COPD, many but not all of the latter focusing on lung function ( 122 – 126 ). A recent genome-wide association study implicated the CHRNA5/3 region and in particular HTR4 in airflow obstruction ( 127 ). At least some of the genes identified are also active in important in utero developmental pathways (e.g., wnt/β-catenin [ 128 ]). However, other genes important in premature onset of adult COPD ( 129 ), such as alpha-1 antitrypsin, appear not to have a developmental role, although interestingly those heterozygous for mutations in this gene appear to have increased respiratory reserve ( 130 )\nAlveolar Growth\nSection:\nConventional wisdom was that alveolar growth was largely a postnatal phenomenon, with an initial rapid phase in the first 2 years of life and a much slower phase until age 8 years, whereupon alveoli increased in size but not in number. A series of recent papers have challenged this concept. In nonhuman primates, where alveolar counts can be made at different ages, alveolar numbers increase until adult maturity. In humans, inhalation of hyperpolarized helium (He3) can be used to calculate alveolar size using a number of mathematical modeling techniques and has demonstrated that alveolar size does not change between the ages of 7 and 21 years ( 131 ).\nAdverse effects on alveolar growth have really only been studied in the context of prematurity and its treatment. In animal models, hyperoxia, systemic steroids, and nicotine all impair secondary septation and neoalveolarization ( 132 – 134 ). He3 data in humans ( 135 ) suggest that maternal smoking in pregnancy may increase alveolar size and reduce numbers. The fact that nicotine itself is implicated in both impaired airway and alveolar development calls into question the safety of e-cigarettes ( 136 ). There is also some evidence of catch-up growth, although this is based on cross-sectional studies, not longitudinal data; there are no neonatal data with corresponding studies in childhood and adult life. One group used carbon monoxide transfer as a surrogate for the size of the alveolar–capillary membrane and showed this was normal at rest and on exercise in adult life ( 137 ). He3 data in preterm survivors in adolescence showed that alveolar size was normal ( 138 ). Nitrogen washout can be used to partition gas mixing abnormalities into airway (Scond) and alveolar (Sacin) ( 139 , 140 ). Compared with normal infants, preterm survivors in childhood had, as expected, an abnormal Scond, but Sacin was normal, implying normal alveolarization ( 141 ). However, it should be said that if many alveoli were completely destroyed, Sacin would still be normal, because they would give no signal. Also, all these studies assumed that alveolarization had been abnormal in the newborn period, but they could not measure it, so that there had been true catch-up growth remains conjectural. However, taken together, the evidence is that alveolarization continues for longer, and there is greater potential for catch-up growth, than was previously believed. Certainly, lungs apparently destroyed by necrotizing pneumonias usually recover completely ( 142 ), so at least the potential for catch-up is certainly present. Intriguingly, being brought up at altitude in hypoxic conditions appears to stimulate alveolarization while having no effect on airway function ( 143 ); this raises the intriguing question as to whether keeping the preterm survivors very well oxygenated is as wise as we believed.\nCOPD: Relevance of Developmental Aspects of Lung Function\nSection:\nThere is one final lesson to be learned from developmental aspects of lung growth. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease defines COPD as an FEV1/FVC ratio less than 70%. However, this ratio changes with age ( 144 ); the lungs of young children empty so efficiently that the forced expiratory volume in 0.5 second (FEV0.5)/FVC ratio has to be used ( 7 ), because FEV1/FVC is 100%. Conversely, after age 50 years, increasing numbers of normal people will have FEV1/FVC ratio less than 70%, and after age 70 years, more than 15% of normal people will have FEV1/FVC ratio less than 70%. This use of a fixed ratio without considering the developmental background has two important consequences. The first is that many more normal elderly people will be diagnosed as having COPD ( 145 ). The second is that the severity of the premature airflow obstruction in young adults and even children will not be appreciated; an FEV1/FVC ratio of 75% will be very abnormal at this age. This underscores the fact that premature airflow obstruction is primarily a pediatric disease; this is being overlooked, and intervention delayed, by relying on a ratio that is falsely reassuring at a young age.\nSummary and Conclusions: What Does This Mean for the Future of Lung Health?\nSection:\nIt is clear that if we are to prevent COPD from becoming an ever more important cause of death in adults, we must optimize lung health from before birth and in early childhood. We have much to learn about detailed mechanisms, but there is much we can do now while these studies are going on. We must focus on three preventive measures that have been shown to work. As a matter of urgency, we need to tighten our grip on all forms of tobacco and nicotine exposure, including e-cigarettes. We must legislate to reduce exposure to outdoor pollution, in particular ensuring that very tight controls on vehicle emissions in residential areas are enforced. We need to acknowledge that healthy aging starts in childhood, and unhealthy aging does as well. If fundamental research in the prevention of COPD is to be done, it will be done in early life. Finally, in particular in low- and middle-income country settings, we must ensure that indoor biomass fuel exposure is minimized.

Repeat visits were undertaken on the same day of the week and at approximately the same time of the day.\nResults: PM2.5 levels before the introduction of the legislation averaged 246 μg/m3 (range 8–902 μg/m3). The average level reduced to 20 μg/m3 (range 6–104 μg/m3) in the period after the ban. Levels of SHS were reduced in all 53 post-ban visits, with the average reduction being 86% (range 12–99%). PM2.5 concentrations in most pubs post-ban were comparable to the outside ambient air PM2.5 level.\nConclusions: This study has produced the largest dataset of pre- and post-ban SHS levels in pubs of all worldwide smoke-free legislations introduced to date. Our results show that compliance with the Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act 2005 has been high and this has led to a marked reduction in SHS concentrations in Scottish pubs, thereby reducing both the occupational exposure of workers in the hospitality sector and that of non-smoking patrons.\nEPA, Environmental Protection Agency\nPM2.5, particulate matter <2.5 μm in diameter\nRSP, respirable suspended particulate\nWHO, World Health Organization\nPublic health policy in a growing number of countries has moved to control non-smokers’ exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS), with recent legislation introduced in Ireland, Italy, Spain and Norway. The Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act 2005 to ban smoking in substantially enclosed public places was implemented on 26 March 2006 with the aim of protecting non-smokers from the health effects of SHS. 1\nA recent review of occupational exposure to SHS suggested that workers in the hospitality sector have among the highest exposures to SHS of all occupational groups. 2 Data on exposure to SHS across a wide range of entertainment establishments indicated that airborne nicotine concentrations were up to 18.5 times higher than in offices or domestic residences. 3 Studies have shown that non-smoking bar workers have salivary cotinine levels four times those of non-smokers who live with partners who smoke. 4 Data from New Zealand indicate that non-smoking hospitality workers in establishments that permit smoking have salivary cotinine levels between 3 and 4 times those of non-smoking workers in smoke-free premises. 5 One estimate indicates that between 1500 and 2000 non-smokers’ deaths per year in Scotland can be attributed to SHS exposure. 6 It has been suggested that SHS exposure may lead to the deaths of over 50 hospitality sector workers in the UK each year. 7\nThe introduction of smoke-free legislation in other countries has been shown to dramatically reduce SHS levels. A recent analysis of the effect of the Norwegian legislation 8 showed that total dust levels in 13 bars and restaurants reduced from an average level of 262 to 77 μg/m3, a 70% reduction, whereas a study in the USA indicated that respirable dust levels in a selection of 8 hospitality venues reduced to approximately 9% of the pre-ban level. 9 Similar work in New York State in a mixture of bars and restaurants measured levels of particulate matter <2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5), and found that mean levels decreased from 412 to 27 μg/m3 (93.5%). 10 Mulcahy et al 11 measured changes in airborne nicotine levels as a result of the Irish smoking ban. Their study of 20 pubs showed nicotine reductions of approximately 83%.\nAlthough there are currently no air quality standards for PM2.5 in the UK, both the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have issued air quality guidance for outdoor air pollution levels measured in PM2.5. 12, 13 The US EPA air quality guidance is divided into bands, and for PM2.5 these bands are arranged at cut points of <15.4 μg/m3 (good), 15.5–40.4 μg/m3 (moderate), 40.5–65.4 μg/m3 (unhealthy for sensitive groups), 65.5–150.4 μg/m3 (unhealthy), 150.5–250.4 μg/m3 (very unhealthy) and >250.5 μg/m3 (hazardous). The US EPA standard for PM2.5 has a 24 h averaged target of 65 μg/m3, with an annualised average of 15 μg/m3. The WHO recently revised its outdoor air quality guidance and now recommends a 24 h average limit of 25 μg/m3, with an annual average not exceeding 10 μg/m3 measured in PM2.5. 13\nThis paper describes our methods of measurement of SHS concentrations in a selection of Scottish pubs and examines the changes in SHS levels that occurred as a result of the implementation of the ban on 26 March 2006. It forms part of a comprehensive evaluation strategy to measure the effects of the introduction of the Scottish smoke-free legislation. 14\nRECRUITMENT\nAll public houses in the Aberdeen city postcodes (AB10–12, 16, 23–25) and Edinburgh city postcodes (EH1–8), together with pubs in small towns (<3000 population) in the Borders and Aberdeenshire council regions, were entered into a database generated from a search of internet local service directories ( http://www.yell.com and http://www.thomsonlocal.com ). The Aberdeen and Edinburgh city postcodes represented the central areas of these cities. From this database, we randomly selected a total of 50 pubs for sampling in the 2 months before the introduction of the ban on smoking on 26 March 2006 and then again approximately 8 weeks after implementation. We aimed to sample each pub selected during a period representative of typical busy conditions and at a time representative of quieter opening hours. The busy visits were conducted on Thursday, Friday or Saturday evenings between 6pm and 11 pm, with the quiet-time visits carried out from Monday to Thursday before 5 pm.\nMETHODS\nWe used PM2.5 as our marker for SHS concentrations. PM2.5 levels in pubs were measured discreetly using methods similar to those described by Edwards et al. 15 We used a battery-operated aerosol monitor (TSI SidePak AM510 Personal Aerosol Monitor, TSI Incorporated, Minnesota, USA) fitted with an impactor to sample the concentration of PM2.5. The monitor was placed in a small bag with a short length of Tygon tubing attached to the inlet and left protruding to the outside. The monitor was calibrated to zero each day before use and the airflow rate set at 1.7 l/min using a Drycal DC Lite flowmeter. The monitor was switched on, to log PM2.5 levels at 1 min intervals, at least 5 min before the entry to a pub.\nOn entry to each establishment, the researcher purchased a beverage before proceeding to a seat or area as central as possible and away from any doors, windows or obvious potential sources of PM2.5 such as open solid-fuel fires or kitchen areas. The researcher aimed to place the bag containing the monitor at the seat or table level to ensure that sampling was as close as possible to the breathing zone and also tried to ensure that they were not within 1 m of anyone smoking. Air sampling was carried out for a minimum of 30 min.\nDetails of pub layout and other relevant data such as the use of ventilation systems were noted. The number of patrons and the number of those actively smoking at three time points (entry, 15 min post-entry and 30 min post-entry) were also recorded, as were special events (live music, karaoke), the availability of food and the presence of other possible PM2.5 sources such as coal fires and candles.\nThe post-ban visits were carried out on the same day of the week and as close as possible to the same time of the day (±30 min) as those visits carried out pre-ban. The methods used were identical to those for the pre-ban visits, though we additionally noted the presence of no-smoking signs, as required by the legislation, and also the number of people smoking outside the pub entrances at our time of entry and exit. We also looked for the presence of smoking paraphernalia inside the pubs as indicators of continuing smoking activity in the premises.\nDATA ANALYSES\nData from each pub visit were downloaded to a PC using the TSI TrackPro V.3.41 software. A calibration factor of 0.295 was applied to all raw measurements to correct for the properties of SHS particles. 16 A time-weighted PM2.5 average concentration was calculated for each visit.\nDescriptive statistics including the geometric and arithmetic means, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and median were generated for the PM2.5 levels across the whole dataset and then subdivided by city and quiet or busy sampling time. Differences between pre- and post-ban concentrations were analysed by analysis of variance on the common logarithmic scale, thereby comparing geometric means and their ratios. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS V.14.0 and Genstat (Release 8) software.\nRESULTS\nA total of 53 visits were made to 41 pubs in the 8-week period prior to the ban: 37 visits in Edinburgh and 16 in Aberdeen. In all, 18 of the visits were at quiet times and 35 at busy times. A subsample of Edinburgh pubs (n = 12) was sampled at both quiet and busy times. A small number of pubs selected for sampling were not monitored (n = 9) either for logistical reasons or because the researcher decided that, in accordance with the project risk assessment procedures, entry to that particular pub posed an unacceptable risk to their personal safety.\nPost-ban re-visits were made to all 41 pubs at comparable times, giving 53 return visits. Table 1 provides further details on the location of the monitoring visits undertaken, the timing of visits and the levels of PM2.5 measured. The data were roughly lognormally distributed, with approximately constant variation on the log scale. We therefore prefer to summarise these as geometric means. Since the group sizes are small, we have estimated standard deviations within groups by pooling the within-group variation, giving 49 degrees of freedom. Table 1 also provides data on the average number of patrons per pub and the average number of people observed smoking.\nView this table:\nDownload powerpoint\nFigure 1\nLog-log scatter plot comparing particulate matter <2.5 μm in diameter PM2.5) concentrations at pre- and post-ban visits. Diagonal dotted lines indicate various ratios of reduction.\nThe PM2.5 levels recorded during the 53 pre-ban visits ranged from 8 to 902 μg/m3. PM2.5 levels pre-ban exceeded the US EPA unhealthy guidance limit of 65 μg/m3 in 81% (n = 43) of the visits, with 58% of visits (n = 31) recording levels above the US EPA “very unhealthy” index level of 150 μg/m3. Almost 40% (n = 21) of pub visits produced PM2.5 concentrations above the US EPA “hazardous” air pollution level of 250 μg/m3.\nThe PM2.5 concentrations measured during the 53 post-ban visits ranged from 6 to 104 μg/m3. A total of 94% (n = 50) of post-ban visits recorded PM2.5 concentrations less than the 65 μg/m3 US EPA “unhealthy” level, with the other three visits providing concentrations less than the 150 μg/m3 level.\nOne bar in Edinburgh had a very low pre-ban concentration, and post-ban concentration was slightly lower. All the other bars showed at least a 50% reduction, with more than half reducing by >90%. However, at all levels of pre-ban concentration, the percentage reduction showed considerable variation between 50% and 99%, rather than a single common figure.\nAn analysis of variance on the logarithms of the pre-ban concentrations at all 53 visits, fitting terms for city and activity (busy vs quiet), showed no significant difference between the city averages, and busy-time concentrations on average 2.5 times those at quiet times were highly significant at p<0.001. As this comparison was made largely between different bars, we also restrict the comparison to the 12 bars visited twice; the result was still highly significant, with a geometric mean ratio of concentrations of 2.6.\nA similar analysis on concentrations after the ban showed reduced variation between bars. The mean ratio of busy-time to quiet-time concentrations was 1.6, or 1.7 when restricted to bars visited twice. Edinburgh bars had an average post-ban level 53% higher than Aberdeen, though much of this difference was probably due to higher average outdoor PM2.5 levels in Edinburgh (12 μg/m3) compared with Aberdeen (7 μg/m3).\nAnalysis of the logs of the ratios of post-ban to pre-ban concentrations (ie, analysing paired differences on the log scale) showed no statistically significant differences in the average degree of change between cities or between busy and quiet times. Overall, the geometric mean ratio was 0.09, which is interpretable as an average 91% reduction in concentration.\nStudies in other countries have usually summarised change in airborne dust levels after the introduction of smoking bans as the average of percentage reductions (sometimes on measures other than PM2.5). Although we prefer the geometric mean approach, for the purposes of comparison with other international studies, we have also calculated the mean of the percentage reductions here, at 86%. Table 2 shows that this value is comparable with what has been achieved elsewhere.\nView this table:\nFigure 2\nScatter plot comparing numbers of patrons at pre- and post-ban visits.\nThe average number of smokers observed pre-ban was 3, or approximately 10% of pub customers at any one time. As one-third of smokers can be expected to be smoking at any given observational time point, Repace 9 suggests correcting the point prevalence by a factor of 3 to provide the prevalence of smokers within a given pub population. For our dataset this would give a 30% smoker prevalence, broadly in line with the Scottish population prevalence of 29%. 19\nIn all, 40 of the 41 pubs visited displayed appropriate no-smoking signs at the post-ban visits. In only 1 of the 53 post-ban visits was there evidence of smoking occurring within the premises, and in none of the pubs was there any evidence that smoking was being permitted or assisted by the presence of ashtrays or cigarette ends/spent matches.\nDISCUSSION\nThese findings show a marked reduction in indoor particle levels (as PM2.5) after the ban on smoking in a sample of pubs in Scotland. Although this work forms part of a wider project looking at the effect of changes in SHS exposure on the health of bar workers, analysis of the health data will be undertaken after a 1 year follow-up to allow for seasonal factors. 14 The SHS concentrations described here will help to inform our personal exposure estimates for our study participants to determine whether there is an exposure–response relationship for certain health parameters.\nThere was considerable debate in the media before 26 March 2006, suggesting that the ban on smoking in substantially enclosed public places would be difficult or impossible to enforce, particularly in pubs and bars. 20 Our results indicate that there has been a high level of compliance with the ban, resulting in significantly reduced SHS levels in the cohort of pubs we have sampled.\nPrevious evaluation studies have used a range of methods to measure markers representative of SHS levels. Markers used include total inhalable dust, 8 respirable dust, 9 nicotine 11 and PM2.5. 10 All these measurement methods have individual advantages and disadvantages in terms of ease of use, cost, specificity and ability to provide real-time data as opposed to time-weighted average levels. Increasingly, PM2.5 is considered a relatively specific marker of SHS concentrations and has the added advantage of being amenable to measurement using portable direct-reading instrumentation to give real-time data without the need for costly chemical analyses.\nOur study used a real-time aerosol monitor to measure PM2.5 levels in pubs. Our exposure metric is comparable to respirable suspended particulate (RSP) reported in several other studies. The pre-ban levels we measured (mean PM2.5 246 μg/m3) are broadly comparable with those reported by studies in pubs in north west England 15 (mean PM2.5 286 μg/m3), New York 10 (mean PM2.5 412 μg/m3), Norway 8 (mean total inhalable dust 262 μg/m3), Australia 21 (mean PM10 255 μg/m3) and in restaurants in France (mean RSP 188 μg/m3) and the UK (mean RSP 195 μg/m3). 22\nThe US EPA and WHO air quality guidance levels for PM2.5 are designed to protect the general population from respiratory and cardiovascular ill-health effects associated with exposure to fine particulate matter above these levels. It should be noted that the chemical composition of outdoor pollutants will be different from that of the indoor air measured in this study, and that air quality guidance typically refers to 24 h or annual average levels and not the 30 min concentrations that we have measured. Outdoor levels are influenced strongly by emissions from traffic and industrial processes, whereas indoor sources of particulate matter are more likely to be from cigarette smoke and other combustion sources such as cooking and open fires. The UK Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants suggests that it is not currently feasible to define a satisfactory guideline for indoor concentrations of particles owing to the lack of data linking indoor air pollution and health effects. 23 In the absence of guidelines for indoor air quality particulate matter, comparisons with the health-based US EPA and WHO outdoor guidelines have been used to provide perspectives on the indoor air quality measured in environments where smoking takes place. 9, 15\nOur study measured levels exceeding the US EPA unhealthy level of 65 μg/m3 in over 80% of pre-ban visits. This reduced to only 6% (n = 3) of post-ban visits. Smoking was observed on only one post-ban visit. This occurred in an area of the pub reserved for a private function and generated the highest PM2.5 concentration (104 μg/m3) of all 53 post-ban visits. There was some indication in the other two examples where the post-ban concentration exceeded the US EPA 65 μg/m3 unhealthy level that the source of PM2.5 may have been from patrons smoking at the entrance to the pub, with the smoke from their cigarettes drifting into the main area.\nOther studies looking at changes in airborne concentrations of SHS markers in the hospitality sector after the introduction of smoke-free ordinance have shown reductions in the order of 80–95%. 9– 11, 17, 18 Table 2 provides an overview of the results of several pre/post smoke-free legislation evaluations carried out around the world. Our work has shown an average reduction in PM2.5 levels of 86% and so demonstrates that the Scottish legislation has achieved reductions in SHS within pubs comparable to those observed in other countries and cities that have implemented similar smoke-free ordinances.\nIt is interesting to contrast the results presented in table 2 with those reported from an evaluation of the Finnish partial smoking restrictions requiring improved ventilation and restriction of the serving area available for smoking customers. 24 A study of 20 Finnish bars and restaurants measured geometric mean airborne nicotine levels of 7.1 μg/m3 before the introduction of legislation and 7.3 μg/m3 after the measures were put into place. The authors state that the legislative measures introduced in Finland have had little effect in reducing SHS levels in pubs and restaurants.\nOur study was restricted by the short time period between inception and the implementation of the legislation and so it was not possible to measure the levels in all pubs at both quiet and busy time periods. However, we believe that the selection of pubs was representative and the fall in levels so large that these data can be extrapolated to all premises adhering to the ban.\nIt is difficult to determine how representative our sample is of the whole Scottish pub cohort. The pubs visited were selected at random from a database of all central Edinburgh and Aberdeen pubs, together with pubs from small communities in Aberdeenshire and the Borders areas. We did exclude a small number of pubs for logistical reasons and to ensure the safety of the researchers. Most of these excluded pubs were from more out-lying areas or in postcodes with high deprivation category scores. Edwards et al 15 have examined SHS levels in affluent compared with deprived pubs in north-west England and found that pubs in deprived areas had mean PM2.5 levels that were almost double those in affluent areas (384 vs 187 μg/m3). Although our selection bias may have led us to measure slightly lower mean SHS levels in the pre-ban visits, it seems likely that our post-ban measurements are reasonably representative. Figures from the enforcing authorities suggest that compliance with the legislation is high throughout the community, with over 99.4% of premises found to be free of smoking activity during more than 3900 inspections across Scotland between March and May 2006. 25 Hence, we think that the 86% reduction in PM2.5 levels found in our cohort may be a conservative estimate of the reductions achieved across the whole population of Scottish licensed premises.\nOur pre-ban visits were conducted in February and March and our post-ban visits were completed in May and June. It is possible that there was some seasonal influence on the reductions of PM2.5 we observed. Windows and doors were more likely to be open during the post-ban visits and so the number of air changes per hour in pubs was likely to have been higher and this would tend to reduce PM2.5 or SHS concentrations.\nWe noted substantial numbers of customers smoking outside the entrance to pubs during the post-ban visits. It will be interesting to note whether this practice continues when the weather conditions become less favourable in the winter months. This potential seasonal effect will be considered when we complete the 1-year follow-up.\nThe average PM2.5 concentration outdoors on the days we performed the visits was 7 μg/m3 (range 3–9 μg/m3) in Aberdeen and 12 μg/m3 (range 5–23 μg/m3) in Edinburgh. There was little difference in outdoor air pollution levels between the pre and post-ban visits so the contribution to indoor levels from outdoor particles will have been consistent. Previous work suggests that SHS contributes between 90% and 95% of RSP air pollution in pubs when smoking is permitted and hence we are confident that SHS is likely to have been the dominant PM2.5 source within pubs during pre-ban visits. 9\nAlthough we report a slight reduction in the average number of customers per bar between the pre- and post-ban visits, we note that this reduction was mainly driven by the results from two pubs where the pre-ban visit coincided with a drinks promotion. We also consider that this apparent reduction may be a result of a methodological problem in that we did not count customers who sat at outdoor tables owing to difficulties in observing these areas in most premises. By the post-ban visits in May and June, the weather conditions were more favourable and there was an increase in patrons sitting outside many pubs.\nOur measurements were carried out discreetly to try to ensure that the behaviour of bar workers or customers was not influenced by our presence. We postulated that knowledge of our activity could have induced bar managers or workers to switch extraction systems on (or off) depending on their attitude to the legislation, and that customers could also change their smoking behaviour depending on how they perceived our presence. We are reasonably confident that our measurement activity went undetected and that our entry did not influence smoking or other activities that could have changed the PM2.5 levels in these pubs.\nWhat this paper adds\nThis is the first evaluation of the changes in secondhand smoke (SHS) levels in pubs as a result of the introduction of the Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act 2005 restricting smoking in enclosed public spaces.\nThis is the largest data set of pre- and post-ban measurements made in pubs where smoke-free legislation has come into force. The study characterises the SHS concentrations that bar workers and customers were exposed to before the introduction of the smoke-free legislation and describes the improvements in indoor air quality that have been achieved.\nThis work shows that the Scottish measures have led to reductions in fine particulate matter of about 86%, similar to the SHS marker reductions observed in other countries and cities that have implemented similar ordinances.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study presents a large dataset of 53 pre- and post-ban visits to over 40 pubs and, as such, is one of the largest direct evaluations of the effect of smoke-free legislation on SHS levels in the hospitality sector. The average reduction of PM2.5 of 86% indicates a substantial improvement in air quality in pubs, with many now having PM2.5 levels similar to those found in the ambient outside air.\nAcknowledgments\nThis study is part of the Bar-workers Health and Environmental Tobacco Smoke Exposure (BHETSE) project funded by NHS Health Scotland.

However, the development of instruments to measure perceived characteristics of the local environment is still at a comparatively early stage, and published instruments are not necessarily suitable for application in all settings. We therefore developed and established the test-retest reliability of a new scale for use in a study of the correlates of active travel and overall physical activity in deprived urban neighbourhoods in Glasgow, Scotland.\nMethods: We developed and piloted a 14-item scale based on seven constructs identified from the literature (aesthetics, green space, access to amenities, convenience of routes, traffic, road safety and personal safety). We administered the scale to all participants in a random postal survey (n = 1322) and readministered the scale to a subset of original respondents (n = 125) six months later. We used principal components analysis and Varimax rotation to identify three principal components (factors) and derived summary scores for subscales based on these factors. We examined the internal consistency of these subscales using Cronbach's alpha and examined the test-retest reliability of the individual items, the subscale summary scores and an overall summary neighbourhood score using a combination of correlation coefficients and Cohen's kappa with and without weighting.\nResults: Public transport and proximity to shops were the items most likely to be rated positively, whereas traffic volume, traffic noise and road safety for cyclists were most likely to be rated negatively. Three principal components - 'safe and pleasant surroundings', 'low traffic' and 'convenience for walking' - together explained 45% of the total variance. The test-retest reliability of individual items was comparable with that of items in other published scales (intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) 0.34-0.70; weighted Cohen's kappa 0.24-0.59). The overall summary neighbourhood score had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.72) and test-retest reliability (ICC 0.73).\nConclusion: This new scale contributes to the development of a growing set of tools for investigating the role of perceived environmental characteristics in explaining or mediating patterns of active travel and physical activity.\n""","0.61924475","""http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/perceived-characteristics-of-the-environment-associated-with-active-travel-development-and-testing-of-a-new-scale(082edd3b-252a-4e49-990e-af8881ae7c7a).html""","[-3.187347,55.947691]"

Physical activity (PA) is a preventative factor for non-communicable diseases. Understanding the role of the built environment (BE) to facilitate or constrain PA is essential for public health interventions to increase population PA. The objective of this study was to understand BEs associations with PA occurring in two major life domains or life areas—travel and leisure—in urban India. Between December 2014 and April 2015, in-person surveys were conducted with participants (N = 370; female = 47.2%) in Chennai, India. Perceived BE characteristics regarding residential density, land use mix-diversity, land use mix-access, street connectivity, infrastructure for walking and bicycling, aesthetics, traffic safety, and safety from crime were measured using the adapted Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale-India (NEWS-India). Self-reported PA was measured the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. High residential density was associated with greater odds of travel PA (aOR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2, 3.2). Land use mix-diversity was positively related to travel PA (aOR = 2.1, 95%CI = 1.2, 3.6), but not associated with leisure or total PA. The aggregate NEWS-India score predicted a two-fold increase in odds of travel PA (aOR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.1, 3.1) and a 40% decrease in odds of leisure PA (aOR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.4, 1.0). However, the association of the aggregated score with leisure PA was not significant. Results suggest that relationships between BE and PA in low-and-middle income countries may be context-specific, and may differ markedly from higher income countries. Findings have public health implications for India suggesting that caution should be taken when translating evidence across countries.\nDocuments\nRights statement: © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The original unit commitment problem aims to minimize the fossil fuel cost by determining the on/off status of power units and power contribution of each online unit at the same time. However, the uncoordinated large charging power necessity of plug-in electric vehicles brings unprecedented challenges to the power system operators and further complicates the unit commitment problem. To seamless integrate the plug-in electric vehicles into the unit commitment, a new binary/real-value hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm framework is proposed in this paper, simultaneously determining the binary status and power output of units as well as the power delivered to/feedback from flexible charging and discharging of plug-in electric vehicles. A batch of binary particle swarm optimisation variants with different transfer functions are implemented and compared in solving the unit commitment problem with and without plug-in electric vehicles. Numerical studies illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent algorithm and the impact of different transfer functions is evaluated.\nDocuments\nA Hybrid Meta-heuristic Method for Unit Commitment Considering Flexible Charging and Discharging of Plug-in Electric Vehicles\nRights statement: Copyright 2016 IEEE.

However, if these intrusive recollections persist over a long time, they are linked to long-term psychiatric disorder, especially Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This paper discusses the need to investigate factors involved in the maintenance of intrusive traumatic recollections. It is suggested that the idiosyncratic meaning of the intrusive recollections predicts the distress caused by them, and the degree to which the individual engages in strategies to control the intrusions. These control strategies maintain the intrusive recollections by preventing a change in the meaning of the trauma and of the traumatic memories. It is further suggested that what is needed is a comprehensive assessment of the processes that prevent change in meaning, going beyond the assessment of avoidance. In particular, safety behaviours, dissociation and numbing, suppression of memories and thoughts about trauma, rumination, activation of other emotions such as anger and guilt and corresponding cognitions, and selective information processing (attentional and memory biases) may be involved in the maintenance of intrusive recollections. Preliminary data supporting these suggestions from studies of individuals involved in road traffic accidents and survivors of child sexual abuse are described.\n""","0.45662445","""https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/publications/311216""",

This international multi-center, patient-randomized, parallel-group trial compared early surgery (hematoma evacuation within 12 h of randomization) with initial conservative treatment (subsequent evacuation allowed if deemed necessary). Patients were randomized using an independent randomization service within 48 h of TBI. Patients were eligible if they had no more than two intraparenchymal hemorrhages of 10 mL or more and did not have an extradural or subdural hematoma that required surgery. The primary outcome measure was the traditional dichotomous split of the Glasgow Outcome Scale obtained by postal questionnaires sent directly to patients at 6 months. The trial was halted early by the UK funding agency (NIHR HTA) for failure to recruit sufficient patients from the UK (trial registration: ISRCTN19321911). A total of 170 patients were randomized from 31 of 59 registered centers worldwide. Of 82 patients randomized to early surgery with complete follow-up, 30 (37%) had an unfavorable outcome. Of 85 patients randomized to initial conservative treatment with complete follow-up, 40 (47%) had an unfavorable outcome (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.35, 1.21; p=0.17), with an absolute benefit of 10.5% (CI, −4.4–25.3%). There were significantly more deaths in the first 6 months in the initial conservative treatment group (33% vs. 15%; p=0.006). The 10.5% absolute benefit with early surgery was consistent with the initial power calculation. However, with the low sample size resulting from the premature termination, we cannot exclude the possibility that this could be a chance finding. A further trial is required urgently to assess whether this encouraging signal can be confirmed.\nIntroduction\nIn the UK, there are 1.4 million presentations of traumatic brain injury (TBI) at emergency departments each year. 1 The incidence worldwide varies between 56 and 430 per 100,000 population each year, 2 with the highest incidence being in Asia (344 per 100,000) and the lowest in the United States (103 per 100,000). 3 The mortality rate for severe isolated TBI in the UK varied between 16% and 40%, 4 which is similar to the world-wide rates that vary between 15% and 38%. 3 Intracranial hemorrhage occurs in more than 60% of serious TBIs in one or more of three types: extradural, subdural, and intraparenchymal. Prompt surgical removal of significant subdural (SDH) and extradural hemorrhage (EDH) is well established and widely accepted. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage is more common than both these other types and is clearly associated with a worse outcome, but the role for surgery and its timing remains undefined. Several terms are used to describe the condition, including traumatic intraparenchymal hemorrhage, traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (TICH), and contusion.\nTraditional neurosurgical management of patients with severe TBI (sTBI) is frequently based on intracranial pressure (ICP) measurement. Patients with high ICP (>30 mm Hg) would typically undergo craniotomy and those with low ICP (<20 mm Hg) would be managed conservatively. Patients with ICP between 20 and 30 mm Hg would be observed closely and undergo craniotomy if the ICP rises. 5 This ICP-based approach has been recommended by the Brain Trauma Foundation, 6 although publication of the BEST TRIP trial from Latin America 7 has engendered further debate. However, not all hospitals have or use ICP monitoring for patients with TICH, even though they may be classified as having an sTBI. Early management of patients with TICH requires evaluation to determine whether early surgery should become part of the standard of care in the same way it is for significant EDHs 8 and SDHs. 9\nThe aim of early surgical TICH removal is to prevent secondary brain injury, which is thought to be caused by a number of mechanisms. Extravasated blood is believed to be neurotoxic, leading to secondary injury that may be avoided by early surgical removal. Larger TICHs may be associated with an ischemic penumbra of brain tissue that could be salvaged and some TICHs expand to the point where they cause mass effect, resulting in secondary brain injury. Contused brain does not seem to recover and appears later as encephalomalacic brain tissue loss on convalescent phase imaging. Removal of irreversibly damaged brain contusion with TICH does not increase tissue loss. As with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH), there are patients who will deteriorate clinically and the question of early surgery arises to anticipate such secondary damage.\nUse of surgery for TICH varies around the world. It is more frequent in Asia than in Europe or North America. There have been randomized trials of surgery for SICH, 10 , 11 but none thus far of surgery for TICH. Patients suffering a TICH tend to be younger than those suffering a SICH, and therefore level of disability may have a larger effect on ability to return to employment and economic output. TICHs are more likely to be lobar, superficial, and have a medium-sized volume (25–65 cc). 12 These differences between the conditions mean that the role of surgery for TICH cannot be directly derived from results of the published trials of surgery for SICH. If early surgery is of benefit to TICH patients, then implementation of early referral and diagnosis with immediate treatment may reduce incidence of death and disability in this specific group of TBI patients.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK published their second edition of guidelines for the triage and management of TBI patients in 2007, 13 and the Brain Trauma Foundation published their guidelines for the surgical management of TBI in 2006. 14 Both of these organizations have emphasized that studies have been observational and that there is a lack of class 1 evidence from well-designed randomized, controlled trials. Those unrandomized studies that attempt to compare outcome between surgical and nonsurgical groups cannot adequately control for known prognostic variables. The NICE recommended in the 2007 guideline that research is needed to develop a consensus on criteria for lesions not currently considered to be surgically significant, namely, TICH. This recommendation facilitated the funding of [STITCH(TRAUMA)] to find out whether early surgery would improve outcomes, compared with initial conservative treatment, in patients with supratentorial TICH.\nMethods\nTrial design and participants\nThe STITCH(Trauma) protocol has been published. 15 This was an international, multicenter, prospective, patient-randomized, parallel-group pragmatic trial comparing early surgical evacuation of TICH with initial conservative treatment (ISRCTN 19321911, UK NIHR-HTA grant no.: 07/37/16). Ethical committee favorable opinion was obtained from the Southampton Multicenter Research Ethics Committee (REF: 09/H0502/68, June 15, 2009). Local ethical approval was obtained for each participating center. The trial was conducted according to Medical Research Council good clinical practice guidelines. Formal agreements were in place between the sponsor (Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Hospitals Foundation Trust), the holder of the study funding (Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK), and each participating hospital before commencing the study at each site.\nOnly TICH patients for whom the treating neurosurgeon was in equipoise about the benefits of early surgical evacuation, compared with initial conservative treatment, were eligible for the trial. Patients considered for the trial had had a computed tomography (CT) scan to confirm the diagnosis and size as well as location of the hematoma. Clotting or coagulation problems were corrected before randomization as per local standard clinical practice. Patients were included if they were adults within 48 h of TBI and had evidence of a TICH on CT with a confluent volume of attenuation significantly raised above that of the background white and gray matter greater than 10 mL calculated by: (length×width×height)/2 in cm. 16 (Initially, the time criterion was within 24 h of TBI, but subsequent to an investigators' meeting this was increased to allow time for patients to reach neurosurgery and for the TICH to develop.)\nExclusion criteria were: a significant surface hematoma (EDH or SDH) requiring surgery; three or more separate hematomas fulfilling the inclusion criteria; a cerebellar hemorrhage/contusion; surgery could not be performed within 12 h of randomization; severe pre-existing physical or mental disability or comorbidity that would lead to a poor outcome even if the patient made a full recovery from the TBI; permanent residence outside a study country preventing follow-up; and if the patient and/or relative expressed a strong preference for one treatment modality.\nWritten witnessed informed consent of the patients or their relatives was obtained by neurosurgical staff before randomization.\nIn total, 59 neurosurgical units in 20 countries completed all regulatory requirements and registered with the trial.\nInterventions\nThe two trial interventions were early surgery or initial conservative treatment. Early surgery was early evacuation of the hematoma by a method of the surgeon's choice (within 12 h of randomization), combined with appropriate best medical treatment. Initial conservative treatment was best medical treatment combined with delayed (more than 12 h after randomisation) evacuation if it became appropriate later. Both groups were monitored according to local standard neurosurgical practice.\nBest medical treatment could include (depending on the practices within the center) monitoring of ICP or other modalities and management of metabolism, sodium osmotic pressure, temperature, and blood gasses.\nAll patients had a CT scan at 5 days (±2 days) after randomization to assess changes in hematoma size with and without surgery.\nInformation was collected about the status (Glasgow Coma Score [GCS] and focal signs) of patients through the first 5 days of their trial progress as well as ICP/CPP (cerebral perfusion pressure) measures (in invasively monitored patients), to describe any change in status that led to a change in equipoise for the treating neurosurgeon, and subsequent surgery in patients initially randomized to conservative treatment. At 2 weeks after randomization or at discharge or death (whichever occurred first), a discharge/2-week form was completed by the responsible neurosurgeon or research nurse. This form recorded the patient's status at that time, the mechanism of injury, whether and when they had surgery (including why, if randomized to initial conservative treatment, or why not, if randomized to early surgery), the GCS and localizing features for the 5 days after randomisation, the occurrence of any adverse events (AEs) after randomization (including death, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and surgical site infection), and past medical history.\nBefore assessing outcome each patient's GP (in the UK) or consultant (outside the UK) was contacted to check that the patient was alive, confirm the patient's place of residence, and complete a major AEs form.\nRandomization and masking\nTo minimise biases resulting from lack of concealment of allocation, randomization was undertaken centrally by an independent 24-h telephone and Web randomization service based in Aberdeen University (Aberdeen, UK). Allocation was stratified by geographical region, with a minimization algorithm based on age group, and severity (as measured by whether or not the pupils were equal and reacting), with a random component (i.e., with probability of 80%).\nThroughout the study, data broken down by treatment assignment were never provided to individual investigators or to the study team. Outcome was assessed by questionnaires to patients. If it was necessary to administer these questionnaires in person, then the interviewer was blind to treatment allocation. Outcome assignment, data cleaning, and CT assessment were all made before unblinding the treatment assignment.\nOutcomes\nOutcome was assessed at 6 months by a postal questionnaire translated into the appropriate languages and mailed to patients or their relatives/carers. In those centers where the postal systems were problematic, or there were literacy or language problems, questionnaires could be completed by a social worker or research nurse, who did not know the treatment allocation, in interview with the patient or relative.\nPrimary outcome was based on the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) dichotomized into favorable and unfavorable outcome; dead, vegetative, and severe disability were coded as unfavorable and moderate disability and good recovery as favorable. Secondary outcomes were mortality, time to death, extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE), Rankin, and European Quality of Life Five Dimension Scale (EQ-5D) at 6 months. Crossover and major event rates (death, pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, infection, and rehemorrhage) in each treatment group were also reported.\nStatistical analysis\nPrevious observational studies have suggested a favorable outcome in the nonoperated group of approximately 40% and a favorable outcome in the surgical group of approximately 60–70%. Target sample size was 840 (420 in each arm). This was calculated assuming a more conservative favorable outcome (good recovery or moderate disability on the GOS) of 50% from conservative treatment, 10% benefit (i.e., 50% vs. 60%) from surgery, 5% significance with 80% power, and a safety margin built in to allow for loss to follow-up, making the total target sample size 840 patients (420 randomized to each treatment arm).\nThe independent data monitoring committee (DMC) reviewed data from the study after 50, 100, and 150 patients had been recruited. These interim reviews were confidential to only the data manager and the DMC. The trial was only to be stopped early by the DMC if one or other treatment policy showed an advantage at a very high significance level, or if recruitment rates were unexpectedly low. The DMC recommended, at each review, that the trial should continue. However, in February 2012, the funding agency decided to halt this international study with effect from the end of September 2012 for “failure to recruit in the UK.” At this time, 6 patients had been recruited from the UK, despite our actively encouraging UK center participation throughout the trial. In total, 10 of the possible 36 UK centers expressed written interest in the study, but only seven completed all regulatory requirements to join the trial. Considerable effort was expended in trying continuously to recruit UK centers and raise the profile of the study—the study team had a high profile at the national neurosurgical meetings and national neurosurgical research meetings giving presentations about progress on the study and manning a stand where investigators could discuss the study with the team. Monthly e-mail newsletters were sent to neurosurgical departments and paper copies were posted quarterly. Talks were given in individual centers to encourage recruitment. Help with all regulatory submissions was also provided. Despite these considerable efforts, only 6 patients could be recruited in the UK.\nAnalysis was on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. The analysis plan was adapted, following the decision from the funding agency to halt the trial early, agreed by the trial steering committee and published on the study website before unblinding the data. The primary analysis was a simple categorical frequency comparison using the uncorrected chi-squared test for favorable and unfavorable outcomes at 6 months. 17 , 18 A sensitivity analysis using logistic regression was undertaken to adjust for age, volume of hematoma, and GCS.\nSecondary outcome analyses included proportional odds model analysis of GOS, GOSE, and Rankin at 6 months, Kaplan-Meier's survival curve with log-rank test, and mortality. For dichotomized outcomes, absolute differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported.\nMinimal subgroup analysis was undertaken and regarded as exploratory. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were reported for the following subgroups: age (two bands using randomization strata: <50, 50, or more—given that there were very few patients over 70 years of age, the two upper age bands were combined); volume of hematoma (using median split <=23 and >23 mL); GCS (using standard classification of TBI severe, moderate, or minor: 3–8, 9–12, or 13–15); time from ictus to randomization (using median split <21 and >=21 h); and geographical region (four bands: Europe, India, China, and other). Interaction tests (chi-squared test for heterogeneity) were undertaken and relevant p values reported.\nCosting analysis\nThe costing analysis was undertaken on the ITT basis from an international health services perspective. Resource-use requirements to deliver the interventions (e.g., staff time and overheads) and time spent on hospital wards were collected using site-specific questionnaires and case report forms. Hospital readmissions were reported on participant outcome questionnaires. Costing followed recommended procedures for international studies, 19 , 20 applying country-specific unit costs (sourced from site-specific questionnaires) to resource-use data to generate total costs. Costs were transformed into 2013 international dollars 21 and reported as mean (standard deviation; SD) for each treatment group.\nA generalized linear regression model (GLM), specifying a gamma family and identity link, was used to estimate the impact of treatment allocation on costs accounting for skewed data and adjusting for patient characteristics (age and sex). Sensitivity analyses explored the use of alternative models for analyzing costs. Subgroup analysis presented raw mean costs according to World Bank classifications, 22 based on gross national income (GNI) as follows: low income (GNI <=$1,005, e.g., Nepal); lower middle income (GNI $1,006–$3,975, e.g., India); upper middle income (GNI $3,976–$12,275, e.g., China); and high income (GNI >=f $12,276, e.g., western Europe and United States). Owing to small sample sizes, regression analyses were not undertaken.\nRole of the funding source\nNeither the sponsor nor the funder of the study had any role in study design, data gathering, analysis and interpretation, or writing the report. The corresponding author, E.N.R., and R.F. had full access to all the data in the study, and all members of the writing committee had responsibility for the decision to submit.\nResults\nOne hundred and seventy patients were recruited from 31 centers in 13 countries between December 2009 and September 2012 and randomly assigned to treatment groups: 83 to early surgery and 87 to initial conservative treatment. Two patients were excluded because the treatment decision was made before randomization: In one case, the patient had surgery before randomization and in the other an early decision was made not to operate ( Fig. 1 ). These were serious protocol violations. All other patients were included in the analysis, which therefore reports results for 82 patients assigned to early surgery and 86 assigned to initial conservative treatment.\nView larger version                                     (54K)\nFIG. 1.\nFlow chart for STITCH(Trauma) patients. *One site recruited 1 patient, but had undertaken surgery before randomization—the patient was allocated to initial conservative treatment; another site recruited 1 patient, for whom a treatment decision not to operate was made before the patient was randomized—this patient was allocated to early surgery. Because of the severe breach of protocol, these patients were excluded.\nInformation about Downloading\nTable 1 shows the distribution of baseline variables between the two treatment groups. Patients ranged in age from 16 to 83, with a median age of 50, and 122 (73%) were male. Before the TBI, 164 (98%) were Rankin 0 or 1, and 22 (13%) had a history of cardiovascular disease. The main causes of the TBI were road traffic accidents (RTAs; 113; 67%) and falls (47; 28%). Most of the RTAs were motorbike riders (45; 40%) or pedestrians (29; 26%). Sixty-eight patients (40%) were admitted to another hospital before their transfer to the neurosurgical unit. At the time of randomization, 70 (42%) patients had a GCS of 13–15, 71 (42%) a GCS of 9–12, and 27 (16%) a GCS of 8 or less. The volume of the largest hematoma varied between 10 and 97 mL, with a median of 23 mL, and 61 (36%) patients had a second hematoma between 0 and 26 mL, with median of 3 mL. There were no differences in the three individual components of the GCS, handedness, or characteristics of the second hematoma.\nTable 1. Baseline Variables\nOf the 82 patients in the early surgery group, only 61 (74%) had surgery, 57 (93%) of these within 12 h of randomisation (see Table 2 ). The reasons for not having surgery were patient or relative refusal (15), improvement (1), deterioration (2), seizures (1), anesthetic risk (1), and change of history suggesting SICH rather than TICH (1). Although informed consent was obtained before randomization, patients often had more than one relative and further discussion could lead to a change of opinion. Of the 15 patients/relatives who refused surgery, 9 were in China and 5 in India. Of the 86 patients randomized to initial conservative treatment, 31 (36%) had surgery within 14 days of randomization, 10 (32%) of these within 12 h. The reasons for having surgery were neurological deterioration (29), no shrinkage in hematoma size (1), and rise in ICP (1). Neurological deterioration was identified by a drop in GCS, enlargement of the hematoma or increase in mid-line shift, increase in weakness, or change in pupil size or reactivity.\nTable 2. Surgery Details for Early Surgery Patients Who Had Surgery and Initial Conservative Patients Who Required Delayed Surgery\nSurgical patients in the early surgery group were more likely to have craniotomy than those in the initial conservative group (97% vs. 81%; p=0.016, Fisher's test). One patient in the initial conservative group had burrhole surgery, but all others who did not have craniotomy had craniectomy. The bone flap was more likely to be replaced in the surgical patients in the early surgery group (77%) than in the initial conservative group (42%; Fisher test's, p=0.001). As Table 2 demonstrates, surgical patients in the early surgery group had significantly higher preoperative GCS scores for all subscales than those requiring surgery in the initial conservative group. Comparison of the baseline characteristics of patients in the initial conservative group who had surgery, with those that did not, showed that patients who deteriorated and went on to have surgery had larger hematomas initially (Mann-Whitney's test, p=0.010) and were more likely to have at least one pupil unreactive (Fisher's test, p=0.0005), but did not differ on age, GCS at the time of randomization, or presence of a second hematoma.\nAt 2 weeks postrandomization, there were similar proportions of patients in the two groups who were still on the neurosurgical ward: 29 (35%) of the early surgery patients and 32 (37%) of the initial conservative patients. Further, similar proportions had been transferred to another ward or hospital (3 [4%] and 4 [5%], respectively). However, 43 early surgery patients (52%) had been discharged, compared to 33 of the initial conservative patients (38%). Further, there was a significant difference in the percentage that had died by 2 weeks: 7 (9%) early surgery patients compared to 17 (20%) initial conservative patients (Fisher's test, p=0.047). At some point in the first 2 weeks, 7 (9%) early surgery patients were ICP monitored compared to 16 (19%) initial conservative patients (p=0.073), and this affected management decisions in 1 early surgery patient compared to 10 initial conservative patients (p=0.069). Patients were less likely to be monitored in India, where the ICP monitoring rate was 4% (3 of 74), compared to 21% elsewhere (20 of 94). Very few postrandomization events were recorded during the first 2 weeks of the hospital stay: Pneumonia was reported in 8 early surgery patients and 8 initial conservative patients, ischemic stroke (0 and 1), pulmonary embolism (1 and 2), postoperative extradural (0 and 2), septicemia (1 and 0), urinary tract infection (1 and 0), seizures (3 and 0), and other (5 and 1).\nPrimary outcome\nSix-month outcome was available for 82 early surgery patients and 85 initial conservative patients; 1 patient from the initial conservative group was lost to follow-up. Fifty-two (63%) early surgery patients had a favorable outcome on the dichotomized GOS, compared to 45 (53%) initial conservative patients (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.35, 1.21; p=0.171); an absolute difference of 10.5% (95% CI, −4.4, 25.3; see table 3 ; Fig. 2 ). Adjusting for age, volume, and GCS gives an OR of 0.58 (95% CI, 0.29, 1.16; p=0.122).\nView larger version                                     (25K)\nFIG. 2.\nOutcome at 6 months.

Outcomes at 6 Months\nSecondary outcomes\nHowever, there was a highly significant difference in mortality at 6 months, with 12 (15%) early surgery patients dying compared to 28 (33%) initial conservative patients (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.16, 0.75; p=0.007), for an absolute difference of 18.3% (95% CI, 5.7, 30.9). Figure 3 shows the Kaplan-Meier's plot of survival for the two groups of patients, illustrating the significant survival advantage of early surgery compared with initial conservative treatment (p=0.008). Table 3 and Figure 2 show the distribution of GOS, GOSE, and Rankin at 6 months by treatment group. For each of these secondary outcomes, there is a significant trend in better outcome in the early surgery group (chi-squared trend: p=0.047, p=0.052, and p=0.043 respectively), although the proportional odds models did not reach statistical significance (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.39, 1.16; p=0.153; OR, 0.66, 95% CI, 0.38, 1.13; p=0.127; OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.39, 1.15; p=0.147).\nInformation about Downloading\nThe main causes of death were the initial head injury (5 early surgery, 14 initial conservative) and pneumonia (4 early surgery, 2 initial conservative). Other causes in the initial conservative treatment group included cachexia (2), ischemic stroke (2), meningitis (1), pulmonary embolism (2), renal (1), TBI and surgery (1), seizure (1), and unknown– sudden death in the community (1). In the early surgery group, the other causes were hypovolemic shock (1), pulmonary embolism (1), TBI and surgery (1), and unknown in the community (1). Only 8 non-death-related major AEs were recorded: seizure (3); new/enlarged hematoma (2); infection (2); and other (1).\nPrespecified subgroup analyses are shown in Figure 4 . None of the subgroups displayed any significant heterogeneity of treatment response, although the patients with a GCS of 9–12 had the best response from early surgery.\nInformation about Downloading\nAmong the patients who were allocated to early surgery and had surgery, 33% (20 of 61) died or were severely disabled at 6 months. However, 65% (20 of 31) of patients who were allocated to initial conservative treatment and had delayed surgery died or were severely disabled at 6 months, whereas 37% (20 of 54) of the conservative patients who did not have surgery had an unfavorable outcome.\nAn unadjusted comparison of raw mean costs showed that early surgery was, on average, $476 more costly than conservative management ( Table 4 ). GLM regression analysis, adjusting for patient characteristics, showed early surgery to be $1,774 more costly (95% CI, −$284, $3,831) than initial conservative treatment. Sensitivity analyses showed that overall conclusions were robust to the choice of regression model for the analysis. Results from subgroup analyses were highly uncertain based on small sample sizes (and too small to conduct regression analysis) and should therefore be interpreted with caution.\nTable 4. Costing Analysis (All Countries) and by Country Income Group\nDiscussion\nAlthough the trial was stopped early by the UK NIHR-HTA with an associated reduction in statistical power, there were some clinically significant results. These included a statistically significant survival advantage (85% vs. 67%) and a nonsignificant benefit on GOS, both associated with early surgery.\nEarly management of patients with TICH is not harmonized around the world. Timing of surgery in patients with parenchymal hematomas post-TBI has not been standardized. This contrasts with patients who develop EDHs or acute SDHs, because guidelines (NICE 2nd edition) based on strong observational data 8 , 9 have recommended early and expeditious scanning and surgery. Not all TICHs require removal and neither do all the contusions associated with them. Generally, clinical deterioration and expansion of the hematomas and their associated edema tend to trigger the need for surgery. If it were possible to anticipate these changes, then secondary brain damage would be avoided. The objective of the STITCH(TRAUMA) trial was to discover whether early surgery would prevent the secondary deterioration so often observed with conservative treatment. Though the primary outcome is not statistically significant, there is a strong signal that early surgery will indeed prevent such deterioration and save lives. This is noted in the highly significant reduction in mortality and the better outcomes in the ordinal analysis of the GOS and Rankin scales. A larger trial is urgently needed to confirm or refute this signal, which is particularly strong in patients with a randomization GCS of 9–12. This same group of patients with SICH had the best outcomes with early surgery in a previous study. 23\nSome units in some countries routinely measure ICP whereas others do not. In this study, 86% of patients were not monitored for ICP either because the hospital did not have the technology available or because they do not routinely use it for this patient group. 24 The question of early surgery for TICH may be particularly important in those countries that do not measure ICP. An analysis of global ICP utilization trends and aspirations has confirmed that many countries in the world do not have the facilities and resources for ICP monitoring. 25 It is in these very countries that this STITCH trial is most relevant to the question: Should early surgery be undertaken in patients with TICH when there is no option for ICP measurement?\nThere were crossovers from initial conservative treatment to early surgery and vice versa, as occurs in all surgical trials. This is because surgeons feel compelled to provide rescue surgery to those patients randomized to initial conservative treatment who subsequently deteriorate. On the other hand, some patients who were randomized to early surgery did not have surgery because their families withdrew consent. Despite these crossovers, the absolute benefit of early surgery exceeded 10% and was almost statistically significant. If the total of 840 planned patients had been recruited and if the same trend had transpired, this would have been a statistically significant result. In addition, the patients who had delayed surgery had deteriorated to a much poorer clinical state and this was associated with a much poorer outcome (65% dead or severely disabled, compared to only 33% in those operated upon early). This observation supports the primary hypothesis that early surgery is advantageous for TICH.\nAn analysis of outcome by whether patients actually had surgery or not is complex and biased because the decision for surgery was guided by the study in some cases and by a change in status in others: Some patients would have surgery before deterioration and others would only have surgery after deterioration. In the nonsurgery group, some patients did not have early surgery mainly because the relative refused, whereas others did not have surgery because that was the allocation (and either they did not deteriorate or if they did their surgeon or anesthetist did not decide to take them to surgery). We will publish a separate article that will address the driving forces behind the crossovers. We will also publish a separate description of the CT characteristics at baseline and at 5 days in those patients who survived.\nPredicting which patients will deteriorate is complex, and the Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Haemorrhage (STICH II) identified a small number of patients (GCS between 9 and 12) that may benefit from such anticipatory treatment. 23 In general, SICH patients with a good prognosis (GCS between 13 and 15) can be safely observed and only require craniotomy if they deteriorate. This is because there is enough time to perform a craniotomy before other secondary mechanisms, such as brain edema, mass effect with herniation, and reduced CPP from elevated ICP, cause harm. This may also be true for TICH patients. In particular, those TICH patients with an initial GCS between 9 and 12 had the best outcome with early surgery. The economic analysis indicates that a strategy of early surgery is associated with a nonsignificant increase in health care costs. Further work will estimate the cost-effectiveness of early surgery versus conservative management using 6-month and 1-year follow-up data. This will demonstrate the magnitude of additional costs over the longer term, as well as whether any additional costs are associated with sufficient benefits in terms of improvements in quality of life, measured by the EQ-5D, and length of life.\nConclusion\nA larger trial is needed to confirm this potentially very beneficial effect of earlier surgery. In the interim, there is a strong case for operating on patients with TICH who have a GCS of 9–12. Those who are alert or just confused (GCS 13–15) can probably be watched carefully for any deterioration because there is a safety margin, which diminishes the lower down the GCS the patient descends. Once the GCS has descended below 9, surgical intervention appears to be less effective. A strategy of early surgery is associated with a small, nonsignificant increase in health care costs, but further analysis using longer-term follow-up data are required to establish better estimates of costs and cost-effectiveness.\nAppendix\nSTITCH (TRAUMA) Investigators\nPrincipal investigators: A.

Four pressure-difference-limit valves, two relief valves and two brake pedal simulators, are added to the layout of a conventional four-channel hydraulic modulator. The cooperation of relief valves and hydraulic pumps provides a stabilized high-pressure source. Pressure-difference-limit valves ensure that the pressure in each wheel cylinder can be modulated separately at a high precision. Besides, the functions of anti-lock braking system and electronic stability program are integrated in this regenerative braking system. The models of regenerative braking controller and vehicle dynamics are built in MATLAB/Simulink. Hydraulic brake model is built in AMESim through a parameterized and modularized method. Meanwhile, the control strategy of hydraulic brake modulation and brake force distribution are designed. Simulations are conducted via co-simulation interface between MATLAB and AMESim under scenarios of typical braking and ECE driving cycle. Simulation results show that regenerative and hydraulic braking forces are coordinated well during typical braking process, verifying the feasibility and effectiveness of the models built and strategies proposed. Under an ECE driving cycle, the proposed RBS can recover more than 75% of the total recoverable braking energy, which lengthen the vehicle’s driving range by more than 24%.\nAlso in:\n""","1.0","""http://papers.sae.org/2016-01-0438/""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"
"""Imperial_College_London""","""Environmental Health Perspectives – Air Pollution and Respiratory Infections during Early Childhood: An Analysis of 10 European Birth Cohorts within the ESCAPE          Project""","""Supplemental Material (1.2 MB) PDF\nIntroduction\nRespiratory infections are a leading reason for outpatient physician visits and hospitalizations among children ( Williams et al. 2002 ). Most infections resolve with minimal use of health care resources; however, episodes of severe or recurrent infection may require hospitalization or surgery, and the resultant burden on resources is substantial ( Black et al. 2010 ).\nYoung children are particularly susceptible to respiratory pathogens and also to air pollution ( Bateson and Schwartz 2008 ; Heinrich and Slama 2007 ). There is strong evidence that indoor air pollution, such as secondhand smoke and the use of biomass, is a risk factor for respiratory infections in children ( da Costa et al. 2004 ). Evidence is growing to support an association with outdoor air pollution as well ( Brauer et al. 2006 ; Leonardi et al. 2000 ; MacIntyre et al. 2011 ).\nThe European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects ( ESCAPE 2009 ) is a project aimed at investigating the impacts of long-term exposure to air pollution through the development of harmonized exposure data assigned to previously established cohorts that have collected information on specific health outcomes of interest for air pollution research. We analyzed data from 10 European birth cohorts and completed a meta-analysis of air pollution and respiratory infection (pneumonia, croup, and otitis media) during early childhood.\nMethods\nStudy population. We included 10 ESCAPE birth cohorts. The inclusion criteria for each birth cohort were that data on at least one outcome of interest were available during early childhood, and that the ESCAPE exposure assignment was complete.\nBAMSE (Children, Allergy, Milieu, Stockholm, Epidemiological Survey) is a population-based prospective birth cohort of children born during 1994–1996 in Stockholm County, Sweden ( Wickman et al. 2002 ). GASPII (Gene and Environment: Prospective Study on Infancy in Italy) is a prospective birth cohort of children born during 2003–2004 in Rome, Italy ( Porta et al. 2007 ). GINIplus (German Infant Nutrition Intervention Study Plus environmental and genetic influences on allergy development) is a population-based prospective birth cohort, with a nutritional intervention, of children born during 1995–1998 in Wesel and Munich, Germany ( Zirngibl et al. 2002 ). LISAplus (Influence of Life-style Factors on the Development of the Immune System and Allergies in Childhood Plus the influence of traffic emissions and genetics) is a population-based prospective birth cohort study of children born during 1997–1999 in Wesel, Munich, Leipzig, and Bad Honnef, Germany ( Heinrich et al. 2002 ). INMA (INfancia y Medio Ambiente; Environment and Childhood) is a network of Spanish birth cohorts. The four INMA cohorts in the present analysis comprise children born during 2004–2008 in both major cities and rural towns—Asturias, Gipuzkoa, Sabadell, and Valencia ( Guxens et al. 2012 ). MAAS (Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study) is an unselected, prospective population-based birth cohort study (with a small nested allergen control intervention) of children born during 1995–1997 in the Greater Manchester conurbation in the United Kingdom ( Custovic et al. 2002 ). Finally, the PIAMA (Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy) study is a population based prospective birth cohort, with an intervention component, of children born during 1996–1997 in cities and small towns across the Netherlands ( Brunekreef et al. 2002 ). Each cohort obtained parental consent and protocols were approved by all relevant ethical review boards.\nExposure to outdoor air pollution was estimated using land use regression (LUR) models, and methods were harmonized across each cohort ( Beelen et al. 2013 ; Cyrys et al. 2012 ; Eeftens et al. 2012a , 2012b ; ESCAPE 2013 ). Briefly, sampling sites for particulate matter (n = 20–40) and nitrogen oxides (n = 40–80) were strategically chosen for each study area to represent the spatial distribution of concentrations at the residential address of each child at birth, with some overrepresentation of locations with heavy traffic where the largest heterogeneity was expected. Three 2-week sampling campaigns were spread out over 1 year and used to estimate an annual average. Measurement data used to develop the LUR models were collected during 2008–2009 (BAMSE, GINIplus/LISAplus, PIAMA), 2009 (INMA), 2009–2010 (MAAS), and 2010–2011 (GASPII). The annual average was temporally adjusted using continuous measurement data from a fixed monitor that was used to capture background levels in each study area. Models based on GIS (geographic information system) variables related to traffic, land use, population density, altitude, and regional background pollution were developed using common ESCAPE protocols to predict measured air pollution concentrations.\nSeparate models were developed for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides [NOx (NO2 + NO)], PM2.5 (particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in diameter), PM2.5 absorbance, PM10 (≤ 10 μm in diameter), and coarse PM (PM10–PM2.5). In addition, two variables were created to describe traffic intensity at the residential address: traffic intensity on the nearest street, and traffic load on all major roads within a 100-m buffer. Annual average air pollution concentrations and traffic intensity variables were assigned to children for the first year of life based on their residential address reported at birth. The LISAplus study centers of Leipzig and Bad Honnef were not included in the ESCAPE exposure assessment, so children from these cities could not be included in the meta-analysis.\nThe air pollution data used to derive the ESCAPE exposure models were measured in 2008–2011, whereas children included in the study cohorts were born as early as 1994. Therefore, we conducted sensitivity analyses using routine monitoring data to back-extrapolate exposure estimates based on LUR to each child’s year of birth. We used two approaches for the back-extrapolation: The first used the ratio of the average concentration measured from the date of birth through the second birthday to the average concentration measured during the ESCAPE monitoring year; the second used the absolute difference between the average concentrations at each time period ( ESCAPE 2013 ). Both methods altered the spatial contrast derived from the current LUR models without affecting the spatial patterns of air pollutants in the study areas.\nFor each cohort, parents reported (yes/no) physician-diagnosed pneumonia, otitis media, and croup during early childhood (see Supplemental Material, p. 2, for the specific questions used for each cohort). Outcomes were assessed at 6 months (GASPII, LISAplus), 1 year (BAMSE, GINIplus, INMA Valencia, LISAplus, PIAMA), 14 months (INMA Gipuzkoa, INMA Sabadell), 15 months (GASPII), 18 months (LISAplus, INMA Asturias), 2 years (BAMSE, GINIplus, LISAplus, PIAMA), and 3 years (MAAS). It was not possible to evaluate respiratory infections restricted to the first 2 years of life for the MAAS birth cohort because these outcomes were not assessed in the full cohort until 3 years of age. Pneumonia data were available for all cohorts; otitis media data were available for all except GINIplus and MAAS; and croup data were available for all except GASPII, the four INMA cohorts, and PIAMA. Cumulative incidence was modeled in each analysis, unless otherwise specified.\nWe used logistic binomial regression in all individual cohort analyses, and statistical significance was defined by p-values < 0.05. Air pollution was entered as a continuous variable and was not transformed. Models were assessed using the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and the Pearson’s chi-square test. Potential confounders were identified from previous literature and selected a priori. Individual cohort models were adjusted for municipality/city (BAMSE only), sex, older siblings (any/none), partial or exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months, atopy of either parent, child-care attendance reported at any time during follow-up, maternal smoking during pregnancy, secondhand smoke in the home reported at any time during follow-up (not available for INMA), visible mold or dampness in the home, use of gas stove, birth season (winter: January–March; spring: April–June; summer: July–September; fall: October–December), parental socioeconomic status [highest education attained by either parent (BAMSE, GINIplus, LISAplus, PIAMA, INMA: low, medium, high); highest occupational level by either parent (GASPII: low, medium, high); or household income (MAAS: < £10,000; £10,000–20,000; £20,000–30,000; > £30,000)], and intervention (GINIplus, MAAS, and PIAMA only). Models for traffic intensity and traffic load were additionally adjusted for background NO2 concentrations. Children with missing data for any covariate were excluded from individual analyses. Based on the ESCAPE protocol, we calculated estimates for the following increments in exposure: 10 μg/m3 for NO2, 20 μg/m3 for NOx, 1 unit for PM2.5 absorbance, 5 μg/m3 for PM2.5, 10 μg/m3 for PM10, 5 μg/m3 for coarse PM, 5,000 vehicles/day for traffic intensity on the nearest street; and 4,000 vehicle-km/day for traffic load on major roads within a 100-m buffer. We assessed heterogeneity of effect estimates between studies using the I2 statistic ( Huedo-Medina et al. 2006 ). We used random-effects meta-analysis models to calculate combined estimates ( DerSimonian and Laird 1986 ).\nWe used sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of effect estimates to the inclusion of additional potential confounders: birth weight, maternal age at birth, and area-level socioeconomic indicators. In addition, we stratified associations for outcomes that were diagnosed during the first year of life and outcomes diagnosed during the second year of life for cohorts that completed follow-ups at 1 and 2 years of age (BAMSE, GINIplus, LISAplus, PIAMA). Additional analyses were stratified by sex, parental socioeconomic status (low, middle, or high), and residential mobility (moved from the birth address at any time during the follow-up period) to examine potential effect modification. As noted above, we also performed sensitivity analyses using exposure estimates that were recalculated for selected pollutants using back-extrapolation techniques to assess the consistency of associations. In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the influence of neighborhood clustering by including an area-level variable (BAMSE: neighborhood; GINIplus: ZIP code; LISAplus: ZIP code; INMA: rural indicator; PIAMA: neighborhood) as a random effect in adjusted models. Area-level data were not available for GASPII or MAAS. Finally, we used two-pollutant models to estimate the independent effects of NO2 and PM.\nAll individual and combined analyses were completed using identical protocols. Individual estimates are presented by cohort except for the German birth cohorts (LISAplus and GINIplus), which had almost identical study designs and parental questionnaires, and are presented as GINI/LISA North (Wesel) and GINI/LISA South (Munich) because separate air pollution models were developed for each area as part of ESCAPE. Statistical analyses were completed using SPSS version 20 (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA) and SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC, USA).\nResults\nThere was complete outcome (at least one), exposure (a minimum of NO2 and NOx) and potential confounder information for 16,059 children across all 10 cohorts (79.6% of the total recruited population). Children excluded due to missing data were more likely to have parents of lower socioeconomic status (BAMSE, GINI/LISA South, GINI/LISA North, MAAS, PIAMA), mothers who smoked during pregnancy (BAMSE, GASPII, GINI/LISA South, GINI/LISA North, PIAMA); and were less likely to be breastfed for at least 6 months (GASPII, GINI/LISA South, GINI/LISA North, MAAS, PIAMA) or to have atopic parents (GINI/LISA South, INMA Sabadell). Table 1 shows the cumulative incidence of parent-reported physician-diagnosed respiratory infection, by cohort. The cumulative incidence of pneumonia during early childhood ranged from 1.5% in INMA Sabadell to 7.9% in BAMSE (0.7–3.6% during the first year only). Otitis media ranged from 21.8% in GASPII to 50.0% in BAMSE (6.8–26.6% for the first year), and croup ranged from 10.6% in MAAS to 12.9% in GINI/LISA North (4.2–5.6% for the first year). There were differences in breastfeeding, child-care attendance, parental atopy, and secondhand smoke exposure among the cohorts (see Supplemental Material, Table S1). Air pollution concentrations were highest in GASPII and lowest in BAMSE; GINI/LISA South, GINI/LISA North and PIAMA had similar mean concentrations ( Table 1 ). Additional statistics on air pollutant concentrations by cohort are available in Supplemental Material, Table S2. Air pollutant concentrations were moderately to highly correlated (see Supplemental Material, Table S3; e.g., correlation between PM2.5 and NO2 ranged between 0.42 and 0.80, and correlations between PM2.5 absorbance and NO2 ranged between 0.40 and 0.93).\nTable 1 – The cumulative incidence of respiratory infections and distribution of air pollution for each ESCAPE birth cohort.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nAssociations between air pollution and respiratory infection during early childhood are presented in Figure 1 for a) individual and b) combined effect estimates. Table 2 presents combined effect estimates for crude (adjusted for sex and municipality) and adjusted (adjusted for all potential confounders) models and p-values for heterogeneity. The heterogeneity between studies varied and the largest I2 statistics were for models of pneumonia and NO2, PM2.5, and PM10. Effect estimates were robust to adjustment for older siblings, breastfeeding, parental atopy, child care, maternal smoking during pregnancy, environmental tobacco smoke, visible mold or dampness, use of gas stove, birth season, and parental socioeconomic status. For pneumonia, elevated odds ratios (ORs) were found in almost all analyses, and the combined estimates were statistically significant for all measures of air pollution except PM2.5 (OR = 2.58; 95% CI: 0.91, 7.27 for a 5-μg/m3 increase). For otitis media and croup, results were generally null across all analyses except for NO2 and otitis media, for which the adjusted OR was 1.09 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.16 for a 10-μg/m3 increase).\nFigure 1 – Forest plots of individual cohort and combined effect estimates (ORs) by outcome for (A) NO2, (B) NOx, (C) PM2.5, (D) PM2.5 absorbance, (E) PM10, (F) coarse PM, (G) traffic intensity on nearest street, and (H) traffic load on all major roads. Weight indicates relative weight (%) assigned using random-effects meta-analysis. The lifetime cumulative incidence of respiratory infection (pneumonia, otitis media, croup) was assessed at 12 months (INMA Valencia), 14 months (INMA Gipuzkoa, INMA Sabadell), 15 months (GASPII), 18 months (INMA Asturias), 24 months (BAMSE, GINI/LISA North, GINI/LISA South, PIAMA), and 36 months (MAAS) of age. Individual cohort models were adjusted for municipality (BAMSE), sex, older siblings, breastfeeding at 6 months, atopy of either parent, any child-care reported during follow-up, maternal smoking during pregnancy, any environmental tobacco smoke in the child’s home reported during follow-up, visible mold or dampness in the home, use of gas stove, birth season, parental socioeconomic status (low, medium, high), and intervention (GINIplus, MAAS, PIAMA). Associations are presented for the following increments in exposure: 10 μg/m3 for NO2, 20 μg/m3 for NOx, 5 μg/m3 for PM2.5, 1 unit for PM2.5 absorbance, 10 μg/m3 for PM10, 5 μg/m3 for coarse PM, 5,000 vehicles/day for traffic intensity on the nearest street; and 4,000 vehicle-km/day for traffic load on major roads within a 100-m buffer.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nEffect estimates in two-pollutant models that included NO2 plus one of the PM exposures were closer to the null (vs. estimates from single-pollutant models), and the only statistically significant finding was for NO2 and otitis media (OR = 1.13; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.26 for a 10-μg/m3 increase in NO2) when adjusted for coarse PM (see Supplemental Material, Table S4). Confidence intervals increased substantially in two-pollutant models, reflecting the high correlation between pollutants (see Supplemental Material, Table S3).\nAll measures of air pollution were associated with pneumonia (p < 0.05) in analyses restricted to the first year of life (e.g., OR = 4.06; 95% CI: 1.93, 8.57 for a 5-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5) ( Table 3 ). Further, the combined effect estimate for all associations (pneumonia, otitis media, and croup) increased when analyses were restricted to outcomes in the first year of life.\nTable 3 – Adjusted combined estimates for air pollution exposure at the birth address and respiratory infection by year of life [OR (95% CI)].\nView larger image (TIF File)\nStratified meta-analyses suggested slightly stronger effects in females and in those from middle socioeconomic groups (see Supplemental Material, Tables S5 and S6). In analyses stratified by residential mobility during follow-up, the associations between air pollution and respiratory infection were not consistent by strata: Pneumonia effects were greater for movers (OR = 1.62; 95% CI: 1.20, 2.18 vs. 1.21; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.67 for NO2), whereas otitis media effects were greater for nonmovers (OR = 1.08; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.16 vs. 1.03; 95% CI: 0.71, 1.48 for NO2; see Supplemental Material, Table S7). Inclusion of additional covariates into the individual cohort models (birth weight, maternal age and area level socioeconomic indicators) did not change air pollution effect estimates or improve model fit (data not shown). There was no consistent evidence for spatial clustering when area-level variables were included as a random effect in models (data not shown). Finally, analyses using back-extrapolated monitoring data were generally consistent with the main findings (see Supplemental Material, Table S8).\nDiscussion\nAs part of the ESCAPE project we had the unprecedented opportunity to examine outdoor air pollution as a risk factor for respiratory infection during early childhood in an analysis combining 10 European birth cohorts (NTotal = 16,059) with data on parent-reported physician-diagnosed pneumonia, otitis media, and croup; we also examined individual air pollution exposure estimates based on common ESCAPE protocols. We found consistent evidence for an association between air pollution and pneumonia, and some evidence for otitis media, during the first two years of life.\nSimilar to secondhand smoke ( U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2006 ), air pollution is thought to increase susceptibility to respiratory infections primarily via an inflammatory response ( Li et al. 2008 ). Urban air pollution may impair defense mechanisms ( Clarke et al. 2000 ; Leonardi et al. 2000 ), and oxidant pollutants, in particular, may exacerbate virus-induced inflammation of the respiratory system ( Lambert et al. 2003 ; Spannhake et al. 2002 ).\nAnalyses were restricted to the first years of life to include the period of greatest age-specific incidence of respiratory infections ( Schnabel et al. 2009 ; Walker et al. 2013 ). Our findings suggested that air pollution effects may be slightly stronger during the first year ( Table 3 ). This finding could highlight a unique period of susceptibility when children are at increased risk of respiratory infections due to air pollution ( Gehring et al. 2002 ; Gouveia and Fletcher 2000 ; Heinrich and Slama 2007 ). It is also possible that the null findings for infections during the second year of life are due to increased exposure misclassification as older children may spend less time at their home address due to increased child-care enrollment.\nA unique strength of LUR models is their ability to capture small-scale spatial variability in exposure; however, the measurements used to create the ESCAPE exposure models were taken after the birth year ( Eeftens et al. 2012a ; Cyrys et al. 2012 ), and this may have introduced exposure misclassification. Although it is possible that overall levels of air pollution changed during this period, previous findings suggest that the spatial distribution of air pollutants within each area remained consistent ( Cesaroni et al. 2012 ; Eeftens et al. 2011 ; Wang et al. 2013 ). Further, our sensitivity analyses using monitoring data to back-extrapolate exposure estimates to the actual first year of life were consistent with our main findings (see Supplemental Material, Table S8).\nThe wording of parental questionnaires was similar across each cohort, and previous research has shown good agreement between maternal recall and medical records during early childhood ( D’Souza-Vazirani et al. 2005 ; Vernacchio et al. 2007 ). Geographic differences in the prevalence of outcomes across the cohorts were most pronounced for otitis media and may point to potential diagnostic biases or disease misclassification between countries. It was not possible to adjust for epidemics, the impact of vaccinations, or the frequency of infections because data were not available across all cohorts. Furthermore, defining upper respiratory tract infections (otitis media, croup) by physician diagnosis is complicated by the fact that not all infections present with acute symptoms severe enough to warrant a physician visit, in contrast with pneumonia, which routinely presents with a high fever and/or difficulty breathing ( Edmond et al. 2012 ).\nConclusion\nOur meta-analysis of 10 European birth cohorts found consistent evidence for an association between traffic-related air pollution and pneumonia, and some evidence to suggest an association with otitis media. Policies aimed at reducing air pollution may be successful in reducing the overall burden of pneumonia in early childhood.\nCorrection\nThe value for “Traffic load on major streets within 100-m buffer” for GINI/LISA South in Table 1 was incorrect in the manuscript originally published online.

Recent studies have found associations between particulate matter (PM) and increased risk of low birth weight, preterm birth, and decrease in birth weight ( Dadvand et al. 2013 ; Pedersen et al. 2013 ; Sapkota et al. 2010 ). Major congenital anomalies include structural defects such as heart defects and neural tube defects and chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome, and are diagnosed in 2–4% of births [ World Health Organization (WHO) 2012 ]. They are a main cause of infant mortality and important contributor to childhood and adult morbidity, but their etiology remains largely unknown ( Dolk and Vrijheid 2003 ).\nThe evidence for an impact of ambient air pollution on congenital anomaly risk is still limited ( Agay-Shay et al. 2013 ; Dadvand et al. 2011a , 2011b ; Dolk et al. 2010 ; Gilboa et al. 2005 ; Hansen et al. 2009 ; Hwang and Jaakola 2008 ; Kim et al. 2007 ; Marshall et al. 2010 ; Padula et al. 2013a , 2013b ; Rankin et al. 2009 ; Ritz et al. 2002 ; Strickland et al. 2009 ; Vrijheid et al. 2011 ). Previous studies have focused primarily on the routinely assessed pollutants; only four studies ( Agay-Shay et al. 2013 ; Marshall et al. 2010 ; Padula et al. 2013a , 2013b ) included other specific traffic-related air pollutants such as PM2.5 (PM with diameter ≤ 2.5 μm). Cardiac anomalies or oral clefts were most frequently studied, but available evidence on other anomaly groups, such as defects of the nervous, digestive, or respiratory systems, is scarce ( Dolk et al. 2010 ; Padula et al. 2013a ; Rankin et al. 2009 ). Summary estimates from a recent meta-analysis ( Vrijheid et al. 2011 ) indicated that nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were associated with two congenital heart anomalies—coarctation of the aorta and tetralogy of Fallot—and that PM10 (PM with diameter ≤ 10 μm) was associated with atrial septal defects. Except for Dadvand et al. (2011b) , exposure assessments in previous studies were based on monitoring data from a limited number of fixed-site stations, and thus did not account for the strong spatial intra-city variation that characterizes traffic-related air pollution ( Cyrys et al. 2012 ; Eeftens et al. 2012b ). Dadvand et al. (2011b) estimated spatiotemporal exposure to black smoke and SO2 with higher spatial resolution. The use of more precise spatial air pollution models in urban areas is increasingly recommended to reduce exposure misclassification ( Hoek et al. 2008 ; Jerrett et al. 2004 ) in studies of traffic-related air pollution and adverse birth outcomes ( Aguilera et al. 2009 ; Ballester et al. 2010 ; Brauer et al. 2008 ). Moreover, in studies of congenital anomalies, spatial models need to be combined with temporal adjustments to account for the very specific etiologically relevant time windows of exposure ( Ritz and Wilhelm 2008 ).\nBarcelona, Spain, is among the most polluted cities in Europe ( Cyrys et al. 2012 ; Eeftens et al. 2012b ). This is partly attributable to its geography; high traffic density ( Ajuntament de Barecelona 2007 ), which is four times higher than London; and large proportion of diesel-powered vehicles, currently 50% ( Reche et al. 2011 ). In Barcelona we developed a refined spatial air pollution exposure metric using a land use regression model ( Beelen et al. 2013 ; Eeftens et al. 2012a ). At the same time, Barcelona has a high-quality population-based congenital malformation register, which has collected detailed data on cases of congenital anomalies and control births for > 15 years ( Greenlees et al. 2011 ). Using these two data sources, we investigated associations between specific groups of congenital anomalies and intra-urban traffic-related air pollution exposures during sensitive time windows in pregnancy.\nMethods\nStudy population. This study used a population-based case–control design. The source population consisted of congenital anomaly cases and control births from the Barcelona congenital anomalies register, Registro Defectios Congenitos Barcelona (REDCB), which has accrued approximately 13,000 births/year from nearly all maternity units in the city since its start in 1992. The REDCB is part of the Service of Health Information Systems (Servei de Sistemes d’Informació Sanitaria) in the Public Health Agency of Barcelona (Agència de Salut Pública de Barcelona) and a member of the European surveillance of congenital anomalies (EUROCAT) ( Greenlees et al. 2011 ). For the REDCB, full-time nurses actively search for new cases at delivery units, pediatric departments, cytogenetic laboratories, pathology departments, prenatal diagnosis units, and pediatric cardiology services; cases of congenital anomalies suspected but not detected at birth are further followed up until age 1 year. Controls are continuously selected as a 2% representative sample of all live births in Barcelona hospitals, by random date of birth sampling, independent of the cases (nonmatched). Clinical information, including maternal age, is collected from hospital records. As part of the REDCB, information on smoking and education is collected by interview with the mother, using a standardized questionnaire ( Salvador et al. 2005 ). Parental informed consent is completed before the interview, and all consenting cases detected during the maternal period at the hospital and the control mothers are interviewed (35% and 95%, respectively); interviews cannot be held with mothers of cases diagnosed or communicated to the registry authority after the maternity period. In these cases, smoking and maternal education information is abstracted from clinical history records. Further, for the purposes of the current study, the residential addresses of the cases and controls were linked to the MEDEA (Mortalidad en áreas pequeñas Españolas y Desigualdades Socioeconómicas y Ambientales) socioeconomic deprivation index ( Dominguez-Berjon et al. 2008 ) at census-tract level.\nThe present study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of PS–Mar (CEIC project 2008/3115/I and 2006/3394/I) and determined to be exempt from separate informed consent requirements.\nDefinition of cases and controls. Controls were all live births enrolled in the REDCB during 1994–2006 with a residential address at birth in the city of Barcelona. Of the 3,149 controls included in the REDCB during that time period, 158 were excluded because of a residential address that could not be geocoded or that was outside Barcelona, giving a total of 2,991 (95.0%) controls for analysis.\nCases were live births, stillbirths after 20 weeks of gestation, or terminations of pregnancy after prenatal diagnosis of congenital anomalies, enrolled in the REDCB and born or terminated between 1994 and 2006, with at least one major anomaly in the EUROCAT list of subgroups of congenital anomalies ( EUROCAT 2009 ). Cases with only minor congenital anomalies, such as facial asymmetry (code Q67.0) or talipes or pes calcaneovalgus (Q66.4) were excluded from the study, following the EUROCAT exclusion list ( EUROCAT 2009 ). The range of codes for inclusion was, according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) ( WHO 1993 ), the Q chapter. Cases with chromosomal anomalies (Q90–Q92, Q93, Q96–Q99; n = 719), and teratogenic and genetic syndromes (Q86, Q87; n = 72) were excluded. Twins were treated as one outcome (12 pairs) and classified as a case if one or both had a congenital anomaly; siblings were classified as separate outcomes. Cases with residential addresses that could not be geocoded or that were outside Barcelona were excluded (n = 166), as were spontaneous abortion before 20 weeks of gestation (n = 5). In addition, we excluded cases that could not be classified according to the timing of the vulnerable time window of exposure (i.e., 3–8 weeks gestation, when organogenesis occurs) because any information on birth date, gestational age (GA), and date of the last menstrual period (LMP) (n = 74) was available. Of 3,295 cases, 2,247 (68%) were included in analysis. Cases were classified into anomaly subgroups following EUROCAT guidelines ( EUROCAT 2009 ). An a priori decision was made to analyze the following common subgroups of anomalies: neural tube defects (Q00, Q01, Q05), congenital heart disease (Q20–Q26), respiratory system defects (Q30–Q34), orofacial clefts (Q35–Q37), digestive system defects (Q38–Q38, Q402–Q409, Q41–Q45, Q790), abdominal wall defects (Q792, Q793, Q795), urinary system defects (Q60–Q64, Q794), hypospadias (Q54), and limb reduction defects (Q650–652, Q658–Q659, Q660, Q681–Q682, Q688, Q69–Q74). To replicate results from previous studies ( Vrijheid et al. 2011 ), we also considered eight subgroups of cardiac anomalies: transposition of great vessels (Q203), ventricular septal defect (Q210), atrial septal defect (Q211), atrioventricular defect (Q212), tetralogy of Fallot (Q213), tricuspid atresia and stenosis (Q224), pulmonary valve stenosis (Q221), and coarctation of aorta (Q251).\nExposure assessment. This study combined the spatial land use regression (LUR) modeling developed in the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects–ESCAPE ( ESCAPE 2009 ) with a temporal adjustment, providing both spatial and spatiotemporal exposure estimates. LUR models are commonly used to explain the small-scale within-city variation of traffic-related air pollutants; temporal adjustment is needed to account for the timing of exposure in relation to organogenesis—during weeks 3 to 8 of pregnancy ( Moore et al.1998 ).\nSpatial estimates. LUR models were constructed in Barcelona for the year 2009 as part of the ESCAPE project. Pollutants included NO2, nitrogen oxides (NOx), PM10, PMcoarse (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter 10–2.5 μm), PM2.5, and PM2.5 absorbance (as a marker of black carbon) ( Cyrys et al. 2003 ). The methodology has been described in detail elsewhere ( Beelen et al. 2013 ; Cyrys et al. 2012 ; Eeftens et al. 2012a ). All addresses were geocoded to assign the spatial exposure estimates. We assumed that the residential address at delivery was constant during the whole pregnancy period and that the city spatial distribution of pollutants and their determinants remained constant over the study period.\nSpatiotemporal estimates. The start and end dates of weeks 3–8 of pregnancy were determined from the date of birth and the GA recorded on the register (n = 4,866). When GA was not available, the declared date of LMP was used (n = 261) to determine it. When only the birth date was available, we imputed the GA with the mean GA for the specific type of delivery (live birth, stillbirth, or termination of pregnancy; n = 111).\nTo estimate exposure during the “critical window” for organogenesis (weeks 3–8), background routine daily ambient air pollution monitoring data were used. NO2 and NOx series were available for the complete study period, from 1994 through 2006 (29% of days with no measurement), and PM10 data from 2000 through 2006 (68% of days with no measurement). On days with no measurement, NO2 and NOx data were estimated using the multiple imputation method developed in the ICE function of the statistical package STATA version 8 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Because of the large number of days for which PM10 data were missing, we did not impute missing PM10 data. Instead, we restricted our population to those pregnancies with data available on ≥ 2 days per week for at least 5 of the 6 weeks of interest (weeks 3–8 of gestation). This resulted in 63% of the original population. Then, according to the ratio method procedure in the ESCAPE manual for extrapolation back in time ( ESCAPE 2009 ), we calculated the spatiotemporal exposure estimates as follow:\nProcedure for extrapolation back in time. The daily spatiotemporal exposure estimates (Cextrapolated) for each pregnancy were the spatial exposure estimation (CESCAPE) multiplied by a daily temporal adjustment (Ratioroutine) that was calculated as the ratio between the daily NO2, NOx, or PM10 measurements at the background routine monitoring station (Cdaily) and its annual 2009 average (Croutine_yearESCAPE):\nCextrapolated = CESCAPE × Ratioroutine, [1]\nwhere\nRatioroutine = Cdaily/Croutine_yearESCAPE. [2]\nDaily spatiotemporal estimates were averaged over weeks 3–8 of each pregnancy to obtain the final exposure. We further applied the NOx daily temporal adjustment to PM2.5 absorbance spatial estimates because of their high correlation ( Cyrys et al. 2003 ), and the PM10 daily temporal adjustment to PMcoarse and PM2.5 ( Pedersen et al. 2013 ), to obtain the respective spatiotemporal estimates of exposure to air pollution, following the methodology in ESCAPE (2009) .\nStatistical analysis. We examined the association between the spatial and spatiotemporal exposure estimates and 18 groups of congenital anomalies using unconditional logistic regression models. Air pollution exposure estimates were entered into the model as continuous covariates. The odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in air pollutant concentration measured at the spatial level to ensure consistent exposure contrasts between spatial and spatiotemporal estimates, and comparable contrasts among different pollutants. Models were adjusted for year of birth/termination, season of conception, and maternal age, all as categorical variables, and for the MEDEA socioeconomic deprivation index as a continuous variable ( Dadvand et al. 2011a ; Ritz et al. 2002 ).\nWe tested potential confounding by maternal smoking and maternal education in sensitivity analyses restricted to the populations with data available on these variables (70% and 80% of the full study population, respectively). Information on maternal smoking during each month of pregnancy was used to calculate the proportion of smokers during the first trimester as a two-category variable (yes or quit/no). Maternal education was coded as a four-category variable (primary/secondary/college/university). The assumption of a stable spatial exposure surface over the entire study period was investigated by stratifying the population according to year of birth/termination (before and after 2000). All analyses were performed using the statistical package STATA versions 8 and 10.1 (StataCorp).\nResults\nThe study included 2,247 cases and 2,991 controls. There were no statistically significant differences between cases and controls for season of conception, sex, maternal age, and socioeconomic index ( Table 1 ), but differences were seen for maternal smoking during first trimester and for maternal education: Mothers of cases had less education and smoked more frequently than did mothers of controls. Both these characteristics were derived from the interview with the mother completed by the 35% of cases and 95% of controls; in that subpopulation, the exposure distribution was not differential among cases and controls (see Supplemental Material, Table S1).\nTable 1 – Main characteristics of cases and controls for 1994–2006 [n (%)].\nView larger image (TIF File)\nExposure distributions of the air pollutants are presented in Table 2 . The IQRs of the spatiotemporal exposure estimates, which were averaged over the 6-week period of organogenesis for each observation, were wider than the IQRs of the spatial estimates, which were averaged over an entire year, because of the short averaging time and seasonal variation. Exposure estimates were somewhat higher among controls than among cases for all exposures. The range of correlations between spatial exposures (r = 0.16–0.93) was much wider than the corresponding range of correlations among the spatiotemporal exposures (r = 0.85–0.91) ( Table 3 ) because of the high seasonal correlation between the pollutants (data not shown) and the use of NOx and PM10 temporal trends to adjust the other air pollutants. Correlations between spatial and spatiotemporal estimates were moderate to low (r = 0.55 and 0.26 for NOx and PM10 respectively).\nTable 2 – Median (IQR) of spatial and spatiotemporal exposure of air pollutants, by cases and controls.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nWe observed several statistically significant associations between IQR increases in spatial air pollutant exposure estimates and congenital anomaly groups (see Supplemental Material, Table S2): coarctation of the aorta and NO2 [adjusted (adj)ORspatial = 1.08; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.16], NOx (adjORspatial = 1.06; 95%CI: 1.00, 1.13), and PM2.5 (adjORspatial = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.57); transposition of great vessels and PM10 (adjORspatial = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.57); digestive system defects and NO2 (adjORspatial = 1.07; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.13) and NOx (adjORspatial = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.10); and abdominal wall defects and PMcoarse (adjORspatial = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.48). Furthermore, statistically significant negative associations with IQR increases in exposure were observed for all nonchromosomal anomalies and PM2.5 absorbance (adjORspatial = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.98), all congenital heart defects and PM2.5 absorbance (adjORspatial = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.99), and atrial septal defects and PMcoarse (adjORspatial = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.89).\nThe association between an IQR increase in NO2 (12.2 μg/m3) and coarctation of the aorta was increased in the spatiotemporal exposure model (adjORspatiotemporal = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.31) compared with the spatial model, though it was somewhat reduced with an IQR increase in NOx (27.1 μg/m3; adjORspatiotemporal = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.04) ( Table 4 ). Similarly, digestive system defects showed a somewhat increased association with NO2 (adjORspatiotemporal = 1.11; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.23) and decreased association with NOx (adjORspatiotemporal = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.04). The association between abdominal wall defects and an IQR increase in PMcoarse (3.6 μg/m3) was also higher based on the spatiotemporal model (adjORspatiotemporal = 1.93; 95% CI: 1.37, 2.73) ( Table 5 ) compared with the spatial model. The spatiotemporal model also generated several statistically significant associations that were not observed in the spatial model, including significant positive associations between abdominal wall defects and PM10 and PM2.5, and significant negative associations for ventricular septal defects and PM10, PMcoarse, and PM2.5.\nTable 4 – Spatiotemporal exposure to NO2, NOx, and PM2.5 absorbance (1994–2006): adjusted ORa (95% CI) for each IQR increase in exposure.b\nView larger image (TIF File)\nAssociations based on spatial models adjusted for maternal smoking (n = 3,752) or maternal education (n = 4,211) were consistent with estimates that were not adjusted for these variables when restricted to the population with available smoking or education data (see Supplemental Material, Tables S3 and S4). However, some associations differed when based on the restricted populations compared with the full study population. In particular, there were more positive associations (ORs > 1) in the restricted population. The direction and magnitude of associations were comparable for anomalies identified from 1994 through 1999 (n = 2,324) and 2000 through 2006 (n = 2,913), consistent with our assumption of a stable exposure surface over the entire study period, though estimates based on the earlier subset were less precise (see Supplemental Material, Table S5).\nDiscussion\nIn this study we used both spatial and spatiotemporal exposure assessment frameworks to evaluate the association between traffic-related air pollution and groups of congenital anomalies. We included pollutants not previously studied in this field: PMcoarse, PM2.5, and PM2.5 absorbance, all of which are characterized by within-city variability ( Eeftens et al. 2012b ; Jerrett et al. 2005 ). We found little evidence for an association between most of the traffic-related air pollutants and most of the congenital anomaly groups studied. However, we observed statistically significant positive associations with both spatial and spatiotemporal exposure estimates for NO2 and NOx with coarctation of the aorta and digestive system anomalies, and for PMcoarse and abdominal wall defects.\nGiven the multiple comparisons involved in testing a large range of congenital anomaly subtypes against six pollution measures, our analyses are likely to have given rise to some chance associations, and results should be interpreted with caution. To avoid errors due to false-positive statistically significant associations (type 1 errors), we emphasized statistically significant associations from the spatial model that persisted after temporal adjustment, in contrast with statistically significant positive or negative associations based on only one of the two exposure models, which we considered more likely to be attributable to chance. Evaluation of consistency with the previous meta-analysis has further been used to interpret the role of chance as an explanation of our main findings.\nThe positive association between coarctation of the aorta and NO2 is consistent with a recent meta-analysis ( Vrijheid et al. 2011 ) that combined results of four published studies and reported a summary OR for coarctation of the aorta of 1.20 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.44) per 10-ppb increase in NO2 exposure. For comparison, in our study the OR from the spatiotemporal model for a 10-ppb increment in NO2 was 1.23 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.48). Although in our study the number of cases with coarctation of the aorta is small (n = 69), the consistency of findings between spatial and spatiotemporal models, and with the published meta-analysis, appears to strengthen evidence for an association. NO2 and NOx were highly correlated, making it hard to separate their effect, but in the spatiotemporal exposure models NO2 appeared somewhat more strongly associated with coarctation of the aorta than NOx. We also found consistent results between the spatial and the spatiotemporal models when analyzing the association between NO2, NOx, and digestive system anomalies. Only two previous studies evaluated these anomalies: Dolk et al. (2010) reported no association with NO2, but the exposure assessment was based on annual mean levels only; Rankin et al. (2009) evaluated digestive system anomalies in relation to black smoke and also reported no association. In the present study, an association between abdominal wall defects and PMcoarse was observed in both spatial and spatiotemporal models. We are aware of only two previous studies that evaluated associations between air pollutants and abdominal wall defects ( Dolk et al. 2010 ; Padula et al. 2013a ), and both reported nonsignificant associations except for the association between PM10 and omphalocele reported by Dolk et al. (2010) . Therefore, further research on this outcome is needed.\nThe exposure assessment method used in this study was a temporally adjusted LUR built to capture and replicate the spatial variability within cities of traffic-related air pollutants ( Cyrys et al. 2012 ; Eeftens et al. 2012b ). Additionally, for congenital anomalies, it is of great importance to assess exposure during the critical pregnancy weeks 3–8 ( Moore et al. 1998 ), because any exposure after this period would not contribute to the etiology of a major congenital anomaly. Only recent studies on congenital anomalies and air pollution used a spatiotemporal exposure assessment, but they were not covering the same range of pollutants ( Dadvand et al. 2011b ) or assessing the exposure at less refined spatial resolution ( Agay-Shay et al. 2013 ; Padula et al. 2013a , 2013b ). The spatial LUR model we used for Barcelona resulted in a spatial exposure assessment with similar variability (i.e., similar width of the IQR) to previous studies in this field ( Vrijheid et al. 2011 ). After the temporal adjustment, the exposure variation increased, widening the IQR by > 50% for all pollutants ( Table 2 ), thus giving greater statistical power to detect associations in the spatiotemporal models compared with the spatial models. In particular, NO2 and NOx IQRs (reflecting within-city spatial variation) were larger than for particulate matter, partially explaining the null results for particulate matter in the spatial exposure models. One important assumption in using the LUR is that the city spatial distribution of pollutants and their determinants remained constant over the study period; if this assumption is violated, the ORs may be attenuated ( Wu et al. 2011 ). To test this assumption we split the population by earlier and later years of termination/birth (before 2000 vs. during or after 2000); results were consistent with the overall analyses, although earlier years had wider confidence intervals than the later years. Recently Cesaroni et al. (2012) showed in Rome, a city with characteristics (e.g., climate, traffic) similar to those of Barcelona, a correlation of 96% for the exposure estimates from two LUR models produced 11 years apart. Furthermore, we did not observe long-term trends in NO2 and PM10 (data not shown). A limitation of our exposure assessment method is that we used NOx and PM10 temporal trends to adjust other pollutant exposure estimates. This led to high correlations between the spatiotemporal estimates of these pollutants and thus difficulty in the interpretation of results from these pollutants independently. However, we followed the approach developed in the ESCAPE protocol, which has already been used in the recent publication on air pollution effect on pregnancy outcomes by Pedersen et al. (2013) . Another exposure limitation was related to the missing data on the PM10 temporal series, which led to a loss of statistical power in the spatiotemporal models of pollutants temporally adjusted with that series (PM10, PMcoarse, and PM2.5).\nExposure misclassification could be attributable to the time spent in different environments, although we think that it is unlikely to be differential among cases and controls. Exposure misclassification could further have arisen because we estimated outdoor exposure at the residential address at termination/birth as a surrogate of the personal exposure during the first months of pregnancy. In our recent study in Barcelona ( Schembari et al. 2013 ) among 54 pregnant women who carried a personal PM2.5 sampler for 2 days and NOx/NO2 passive badges for 1 week, pregnant women reported time spent at home to be around 60–70% per day, and the correlation between personal exposure and outdoors levels of air pollution ranged from 0.39 for PM2.5 and 0.78 for NOx. This suggests that, particularly for the latter, ambient outdoor levels could act as a good surrogate for personal exposure levels. Residual misclassification may have occurred if women changed residences during pregnancy; but this is unlikely to occur differentially among cases and controls, accordingly with results published by Miller et al. (2010) . Residential mobility was estimated to be between 1% and 6% in a recent Spanish study based on four birth cohorts ( Estarlich et al. 2011 ).\nWe examined a wide range of congenital anomalies that were subtyped following the classification proposed by EUROCAT (2009) . The REDCB includes cases identified among live births, stillbirths, and termination of pregnancy following prenatal diagnosis, which is particularly important ( Ritz 2010 ) for some severe congenital anomalies such as neural tube defects or congenital heart disease (27% and 22.6% of anomalies, respectively, in our study). The register follows the EUROCAT guidelines, but ascertainment may be incomplete if the congenital anomaly is not diagnosed prenatally or at birth. Therefore, the prevalence of all congenital anomalies (including live births, fetal deaths, stillbirths, and termination of pregnancy) for Barcelona was lower, during 1994–2006, than the European register—184/10,000 and 233/10,000 respectively ( EUROCAT 2012 ). The register uses active case ascertainment and simultaneous ascertainment of population-based controls; it recodes the address at delivery allowing the geocoding used for the exposure assessment in this study. We adjusted for maternal age, conception season, year of birth, and socioeconomic status, although the latter was classified at census tract level.\nOnly a subset of participants had data on smoking (70%) and education (80%). The sensitivity analyses on these subpopulations showed little impact of maternal smoking or education on the findings, thus indicating that their confounding effect is likely to be small even in the full study population. Nevertheless, relying on these subpopulation could be misleading: Missing information probably did not occur at random among cases and controls mainly because mothers of cases detected after birth were not interviewed. This may constitute a selective population due to the fact that only specific congenital anomalies are detected after birth; for example, congenital heart defects are frequently detected in the first year of life ( Todros et al. 2001 ). The results of the sensitivity analyses differed for some congenital anomalies/exposure from those on the full population; in particular, PM10 was statistically significantly associated to congenital heart defects in the smoking subpopulation (both adjusted and unadjusted), but not in the main analyses nor in the one adjusted for maternal education. Residual confounding by unmeasured risk factors such as alcohol consumption and dietary factors (e.g., folic acid) could have influenced our findings. However, it is unlikely that such factors would be strongly related to air pollution exposure, and we can partially acount for them by adjusting for social class on area level in the main analyses, and on individual level as sensitivity analysis.\nThe possible mechanisms and causes underlying the development of congenital anomalies are still unclear, because of their probable multifactorial aetiology ( Ritz 2010 ) and because different types of anomalies are likely to have very distinct etiology. Air pollution–induced oxidative stress during pregnancy has been suggested as one possible mechanism behind pregnancy outcomes ( Kannan et al. 2006 ; Slama et al. 2008 ), because it regulates the pulmonary and placental inflammation, the hemodynamic responses, and thus the transplacental oxygenation and transportation of nutrients. Oxidative stress may also affect organogenesis and neural crest cell migration and differentiation ( Hassler and Moran 1986 ; Ritz et al. 2002 ), which play an important role in heart development ( Keyte and Redmond Hutson 2012 ). More recently, van Beynum et al. (2008) suggested a possible gene–environment interaction effect leading to an increased risk of congenital heart defects in mothers exposed to nitric oxide and smoking.\nConclusion\nOur results overall do not indicate an association between exposure to traffic-related air pollution and many groups of congenital anomalies in Barcelona, even though the air pollution levels are some of the highest in Europe. The positive association of NO2 and NOx with coarctation of the aorta is consistent with a findings of a meta-analysis of previous studies, and requires further study. Associations of digestive system anomalies with NO2 and NOx, and of abdominal wall defects with PMcoarse, also call for confirmation.\nReferences\nAgay-Shay K, Friger M, Linn S, Peled A, Amitai Y, Peretz C. 2013.

ISSN 0306-2619\nFull text not available from this repository.\nAbstract\nMany researchers and industry observers claim that electric vehicles (EV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) could provide vehicle-to-grid (V2G) bulk energy and ancillary services to an electricity network. This work quantified the impact on various battery characteristics whilst providing such services. The sensitivity of the impact of V2G services on battery degradation was assessed for EV and PHEV for different battery capacities, charging regimes, and battery depth of discharge. Battery degradation was found to be most dependent on energy throughput for both the EV and PHEV powertrains, but was most sensitive to charging regime (for EVs) and battery capacity (for PHEVs). When providing ancillary services, battery degradation in both powertrains was most sensitive to individual vehicle battery depth of discharge. Degradation arising from both bulk energy and ancillary services could be minimised by reducing the battery capacity of the vehicle, restricting the number of hours connected and reducing the depth of discharge of each vehicle for ancillary services. Regardless, best case minimum impacts of providing V2G services are severe such as to require multiple battery pack replacements over the vehicle lifetime. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\nItem Type:\n""","0.44333786","""http://publications.eng.cam.ac.uk/578299/""",

It is widely acknowledged that inappropriate provision and dispatch of EV charging can lead to negative impacts on power system infrastructure. This paper considers EV requirements and proposes a module which uses owner participation, through mobile phone apps and on-board diagnostics II (OBD-II), for scheduled vehicle charging. A multi-EV reference and single-EV real-time response (MRS2R) online algorithm is proposed to calculate the maximum and minimum adjustable limits of necessary capacity, which forms part of decision-making support in power system dispatch. The proposed EV dispatch module is evaluated in a case study and the influence of the mobile app, EV dispatch trending and commercial impact is explored.\nDocuments\nRights statement: 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed, PPM Mill, PPM Gat, PPM Gar, and HMESO paraffin-embedded MM tumor sections all stained positively for expression of mesothelin ( Fig. 4A ). However, Western blots of only four of seven MM cell lines in vitro exhibited visible bands for the 40-kD portion of mesothelin protein (PPM Mill, PPM Gar, PPM Gord, and PPM Rob). Immortalized human peritoneal mesothelial cells (LP9) and human primary pleural mesothelial cells (NYU474) did not express the mesothelin protein ( Fig. 4B ). MM tumors derived from the HMESO and PPM Mill, PPM Gat, PPM Gar, and PPM Gard cell lines were then assessed for mesothelin protein after growing either SQ or IP in SCID mice ( Fig. 4C ). These experiments provided evidence of mesothelin protein produced from MM cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. The PPM Mill cell line produced mesothelin consistently in vivo and in vitro and has been characterized in the SCID xenograft model ( Hillegass et al. 2010 ). Therefore, we chose the PPM Mill cell line for our targeting studies. In these studies, PLF taken from IP injected animals contained both normal and malignant mesothelial cells comprising either APMS functionalized with the MB antibody or BSA at 24 hr and 6 days ( Fig. 4D ). In both the APMS-MB and APMS-BSA treatment groups, particles could be seen surrounding cell nuclei showing that APMS persist after localized administration up to 1 week. No particles or abnormalities were seen in saline control PLF samples.\nDownload in PowerPoint\nFigure 4. Mesothelin is expressed in mesothelioma (MM) tumors. Paraffin sections of MM tumors derived from four different MM cell lines (PPM Mill, PPM Gat, PPM Gar, and HMESO) grown in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were stained with mouse anti-mesothelin antibody (clone MB) (A). Alexa Fluor 568 secondary antibody was used to visualize mesothelin (red), and SYTOX Green nucleic acid stain was used to visualize cell nuclei (green). Micrographs were taken at 400× magnification, scale bar = 50 µm. Mesothelin protein was assessed by Western blot analysis on human MM cell lines (B) and in human MM tumors grown either intraperitoneally (IP) or subcutaneously (SQ) (C). β-Actin was used as a loading control. Micrographs of Hema 3 differential stained cytospins from peritoneal lavage fluid (PLF) show uptake of acid-prepared mesoporous spheres (APMS)–MB and APMS-BSA microparticles (n=5 mice/group). Particles surround the cell nuclei at 24 hr and 6 days (black arrows) (D). Micrographs were taken at 400× magnification, scale bar = 50 µm.\nFunctionalization of APMS with an Anti-mesothelin Antibody (APMS-MB) Significantly Increases the Fraction of Administered Dose to MM Tissues Using ICP-MS\nTo test the hypothesis that APMS-MB would be taken up by MM tumors more avidly than APMS-BSA control particles, we examined tumors (pooled spheroid and mesenteric) and major organs of treated mice by ICP-MS at 24 hr and 6 days. At 24 hr, less than 2% of the administered dose of APMS was observed in the lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys, whereas in both APMS-MB and APMS-BSA groups, greater than 6% of the administered dose was present in the pooled tumors ( Fig. 5A ). At 6 days, approximately 3.5% of the total administered amounts were observed in the liver. However, greater than 10% of the delivered doses of APMS-MB and APMS-BSA were observed in tumors, and the fraction of the dose in the APMS-MB tumors was significantly increased compared with the fraction of dose observed in APMS-BSA tumors ( Fig. 5B ). We then examined the delivery of particles as a function of concentration of SiO2 (ppm) (i.e., APMS) in both spheroid and mesenteric tumors at 24 hr and 6 days ( Fig. 5C ). APMS-MB-treated mesenteric tumors contained a significantly higher concentration of SiO2 than mesenteric tumors treated with APMS-BSA at 6 days, indicating that APMS-MB is retained in tumors over time to a greater extent than APMS-BSA.\nDownload in PowerPoint\nFigure 5. Acid-prepared mesoporous spheres (APMS) microparticles functionalized with a mesothelin antibody (MB) significantly increased the fraction of administered dose taken up by mesotheliomas (MMs) at 6 days (n=5 mice/group). The fraction of the administered dose of APMS in major organs and tumor tissue was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (A, B). The concentration of SiO2 in tumor tissue in parts per million (ppm) is significantly greater in tumors treated with APMS-MB as compared with the APMS-BSA group at 6 days (C). *Significantly different from saline control of the same organ/tumor group. †Significantly different from APMS-BSA group. ‡Significantly different from all other organ/tumor groups in the same treatment group (p<0.05). For saline and APMS-MB treatment groups, five individual mice were assessed per group per time point. For APMS-BSA treatment, four mice were assessed at each time point.\nUptake of APMS by MM Cells and TAMs In Vivo Is Enhanced by Multifunctionalization with an Anti-mesothelin Antibody\nTo complement results of ICP-MS studies and determine the cell types associated with APMS-MB and APMS-BSA in tumors, we assessed the association of APMS with TAMs and MM cells visually using CLSM. Cryo-sections from in vivo MM mesenteric tumor tissues were examined using A647-labeled particles at 24 hr and 6 days postinjection of APMS. As expected, no particles were observed in tumor tissue injected with saline alone ( Fig. 6A , B ). APMS-BSA and APMS-MB microparticles, at both 24 hr and 6 days, could be visualized in association with MM tumor cells as punctate areas of fluorescence (indicated by white arrows) ( Fig. 6C – F ). In both treatment groups, APMS microparticles were also engulfed by TAMs (shown in green in Fig. 6 ) and surrounded the cell nuclei. Larger, tiled images of MM tumors from the APMS-MB and APMS-BSA treatment groups show APMS-MB microparticles are translocated from the outer surface of the tumor (24 hr postinjection) to the center (by 6 days) (Suppl. Fig. S1). The APMS-BSA microparticles remain in the tumor periphery at 6 days (Suppl. Fig. S2).\nDownload in PowerPoint\nFigure 6. Acid-prepared mesoporous spheres (APMS) microparticles were taken up by mesenteric mesotheliomas (MMs), retained for up to 6 days, and possibly trafficked by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) (n=5 mice/group). Confocal microscopy analysis of frozen sections of MM tumor tissue at 24 hr and 6 days shows no particles in saline-injected control tumors (scale bar = 50 µm) (A, B). APMS-BSA and APMS-MB were taken up by tumor tissue at 24 hr and remained in the tumor tissue at 6 days following intraperitoneal (IP) injection (C–F) (scale bar = 50 µm). In all panels, APMS-MB or APMS-BSA are indicated with A647 (red) (white arrows), cell nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue), and TAMs are stained with Mac-2 (green). Panels B, C, E and F are of the tumor exterior (tumor edge) vs. panels A and D of the tumor interior.\nQuantification of Percent Positive Area in Mesenteric and Spheroid MM Tissue Analyzed for Mac-2 and A647 (APMS) Fluorescence Intensity\nTo show that the particles do not increase the TAM burden in established tumors, we performed quantitative evaluation of the percentage of mesenteric and spheroid MM tissue area staining positively for TAMs (Mac-2). The percentage of MM tissue area containing APMS-MB or APMS-BSA (both A647-tagged) particles was assessed by CLSM in cryo-sections (as described above) from tiled images. Randomly selected regions of interest from each sample (n=18/tumor) at each time point were analyzed for the percentage of the region of interest meeting the minimum fluorescence intensity threshold set by control sample tissues ( Fig. 7 ). In accordance with results from tiled images, TAM+ areas comprised less than 5% of the spheroid or mesenteric tumor area examined. At 24 hr, significant decreases were seen in the percentage of Mac-2+ area in the APMS-MB treatment group (p<0.0001) and the 24-hr APMS-BSA treatment group (p<0.001) compared with the 24-hr saline control ( Fig. 7A ). There were no significant differences in either Mac-2+ or A647+ areas at 6 days in the spheroid or areas of mesenteric MMs at either 24 hr or 6 days.\nDownload in PowerPoint\nFigure 7. The percentage of Mac-2+ area within regions of interest analyzed in spheroid mesothelioma (MM) tumor tissue was significantly decreased in acid-prepared mesoporous spheres (APMS)–MB and APMS-BSA treated animals at 24 hr as compared with saline controls (*p<0.05) (n=1 tumor per mouse/3 mice per group) (A). Five randomly chosen regions of interest from tiled (4 × 4 tiles) confocal fluorescent microscopy images were opened in MetaMorph image analysis software to determine differences in the percent of threshold areas positive for the minimum fluorescence intensity of Mac-2 and A647 (APMS preparations). Minimum intensity thresholds were set by Mac-2+ control samples of mouse aorta and visual assessment of multiple A647+ areas. No significant differences were seen in Mac-2+ percent threshold areas by particles in mesenteric MM tissues (B).\nDiscussion\nSection:\nHere we demonstrate that APMS, a non-toxic, amorphous silica microparticle, associates with human MM tumor cells and TAMs in a mouse xenograft model of MM. A significantly greater fraction of the delivered dose of APMS-MB was taken up by tumors compared with a non-targeting control microparticle (APMS-BSA). Mesoporous silica nanoparticles and other nanoparticles have recently been highlighted as advantageous platforms for the delivery of drugs and biomolecules due to their large internal surface area and ability to be chemically modified for enhanced uptake and targeting ( Hudson et al. 2008 ). However, nanoparticles are readily taken up by cellular organelles, cause cytotoxicity alone, and are distributed systemically throughout the body, whereby they can cross the blood-brain barrier ( Borm and Kreyling 2004 ; Pantarotto et al. 2004 ; Oberdorster, Maynard, et al. 2005 ; Oberdorster, Oberdorster, et al. 2005 ; Xia et al. 2006 ; Handy et al. 2008 ). These properties of nanoparticles raise concern for their acute and long-term effects as drug delivery vehicles. APMS microparticles circumvent these issues as their diameter (1–2 µm) prevents them from entering cellular organelles and prevents them from persisting in the systemic circulation after localized delivery ( Cheng et al. 2010 ; Steinbacher et al. 2010 ). Previously we have shown that APMS modified with tetraethylene glycol on the external surface are readily taken up by mesothelial cells in vitro and remain in the cytosol, avoiding endosomal degradation of cargo ( Blumen et al. 2007 ). We recently reported that APMS-Gd, a novel porous silica microparticle containing a Gd chelate, can be used as a contrast agent that is able to be tracked in real time using MRI ( Steinbacher et al. 2010 ). The use of this approach in studies described here allowed us to verify that APMS microparticles, once administered IP, are excreted with no obvious adverse effects on organ pathology or inflammation. In previous published studies by Steinbacher et al. (2010) and Hillegass et al. (2011) , the toxicity of APMS (both unloaded and loaded with DOX) was evaluated. Studies by Steinbacher et al. (2010) showed that doses up to 500 mg/kg were well tolerated in Wistar rats (non–tumor bearing) without histological evidence of toxicity to the major organs as evaluated by a board-certified pathologist. In studies by Hillegass et al. (2011) , SCID mice bearing peritoneal MMs were administered APMS loaded with DOX. These mice were treated with 7.8 × 108 APMS/mouse (equivalent to 0.33 mg/kg DOX) 3× weekly for 1 week. Adverse health effects were not seen, nor was there evidence of toxicity present in histological samples evaluated by a board-certified pathologist. However, diffuse hepatocytic cell swelling was observed in animals receiving injections of DOX alone (1 mg/kg). These studies led us to believe that APMS particles do not pose a severe risk to the major clearance/filtration organs and that the low levels of APMS (4% of administered dose) have similar retention patterns, as reported in other studies of microparticle accumulation ( Martin et al. 2005 ).\nOne of the challenges with chemotherapeutic approaches in MM and other chemoresistant tumors is maintaining the longevity of the given agent in the desired locale. APMS microparticles remained in the peritoneal cavity up to 6 days after a single IP injection without altering the inflammatory cell profile, making them advantageous for the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to peritoneal tumors. We have previously published that APMS preloaded with DOX and administered either SQ or IP to established MM tumors in SCID mice reduced tumor burden and volume at smaller doses (0.33 mg/kg) in comparison to administration of DOX alone at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg ( Hillegass et al. 2011 ). Here we show that functionalization of APMS with a targeting antibody for mesothelin (MB) results in enhanced uptake of APMS by MM tumors in vivo and that APMS-MB have potential as a more efficacious chemotherapeutic delivery vehicle than particles modified with a nonspecific protein. However, it is also important to note that APMS, even without functionalization with MB, are localized in tumor tissue and TAMs. Inherent properties of APMS make it an appropriate delivery device for an even broader range of malignant diseases.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that albumin can bind to surface glycoproteins such as gp60 (albondin) on capillary endothelial cells and mesothelial cells and activates transcytosis through an as yet unknown signaling mechanism ( Gotloib and Shostak 1995 ; Minshall et al. 2000 ; Vogel et al. 2001 ; John et al. 2003 ). This association between albumin and endothelial cells allows for active transport across the cell membrane, reinforcing the validity of the data presented here showing some uptake of APMS-BSA particles by tumor cells. Due to the observed mechanism of active transport of serum albumin across the endothelial and mesothelial cell membranes, albumin microparticles and nanoparticles have become an area of interest in drug delivery research. Studies have shown that serum albumin micro/nanospheres are readily taken up by macrophages and degraded within a week following administration ( Schafer et al. 1994 ), unlike the persistence of APMS microparticles observed here.\nWhen we examined MM tumors by immunofluorescence for TAMs, a high proportion was observed. Given these findings, it is not surprising that we see a high level of APMS-BSA microparticles in MM tumors or that we see the greatest difference in silica concentration between the targeted and non-targeted groups at 6 days ( Fig. 5C ). A review of the literature reveals that localized administration of antibody-targeted, drug-loaded microparticles to tumors using similar approaches has not been published. Moreover, studies using IP delivery of microparticles of various compositions for drug delivery show less success with regard to microparticle retention by tumor tissue. For example, one study ( Li and Howell 2009 ) examining CD44-targeted Hyplat microparticles (produced by cross-linking hyaluronan via its carboxylate groups with cisplatin) reported tumor retention values between 5 and 10 ppb as assessed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. We demonstrated that APMS-MB particles had tumor tissue retention values between 800 and 1000 ppm SiO2 over the same time frame.\nRegardless of macrophage involvement or active transport of albumin-modified particles into cells, statistical analysis of our data indicated that the retained dose (12%) of administered APMS-MB targeted microparticles is significantly higher than the non-targeted APMS-BSA microparticles (8%) showing that APMS-MB microparticles are more effective at targeting MM tumor tissue. Furthermore, mesothelin is highly expressed not only in MM but also in more than 70% of ovarian cancers, 100% of pancreatic tumors, and 50% of lung cancers, making this approach relevant to a broad range of malignant diseases.\nMesothelin is shed from the cell surface mediated by the “sheddase” activity of ADAM17/TACE. TACE is a transmembrane glycoprotein known for its role in releasing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands from the cell’s surface, which in turn regulates the activation of the EGFR pathway and can contribute to drug resistance ( Ho et al. 2005 ; Ho et al. 2006 ; Hassan and Ho 2008 ; Zhang et al. 2011 ; Pastan and Zhang 2012 ). Mesothelin has been found to bind to the cell surface antigen MUC16/CA125. MUC16/CA125 is elevated in the serum of women with ovarian carcinoma and is overexpressed in 70% of human ovarian cancers ( Bast et al. 1983 ). Thus, it has been implicated in the spread of ovarian cancer throughout the peritoneal cavity ( Rump et al. 2004 ; Gubbels et al. 2006 ). Mesothelin has also been examined as a biomarker for the progression of ovarian cancer and mesothelioma ( Scholler et al. 1999 ; Robinson et al. 2003 ; Robinson et al. 2005 ; Scherpereel et al. 2006 ). Several phase I and II clinical trials focusing on mesothelin as a therapeutic target for mesothelioma and ovarian and pancreatic cancers have been conducted or are currently ongoing. These studies have used anti-mesothelin recombinant immunotoxins (SS1 [dsFv] PE38 [Fv portion of antibody] SS1 and truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin) alone and in combination with chemotherapeutics ( Hassan, Bullock, et al. 2007 ; Kreitman et al. 2009 ) or the anti-mesothelin antibody MORAb-009 (a chimeric IgG/k/SS1 [dsFv] fusion antibody), leading to an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic response ( Hassan et al. 2007 ; Hassan et al. 2010 ). The mesothelin tumor vaccine (CRS-207) is currently in a phase II trial in combination with the pancreatic cancer vaccine GVAX ( Le et al. 2012 ), and adoptive T-cell immunotherapy using mesothelin and antibody drug conjugate therapies are currently being developed for preclinical trials. The shedding of mesothelin into the interstitial space limits the interaction of targeted therapies and may prevent tumor penetration ( Pastan and Zhang 2012 ).\nWe have shown here that APMS-MB are successfully internalized by tumor tissues. APMS-MB may have a dual advantage in that the MB antibody can effect immune changes such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic response and can direct the drug/biomolecule payloads to mesothelin-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, the potential to bind free mesothelin may hinder the spread of cancerous cells throughout the peritoneal cavity. A further advantage of our treatment modality is highlighted by the identification of macrophages in MM tumors, implicating the involvement of these cells and their potential to traffic APMS to MM tumors in vivo.\nMMs exhibit notably high resistance to apoptosis in vivo, which is thought to contribute to heightened chemoresistance of this tumor type ( Fennell and Rudd 2004 ). Focus has recently shifted to the interactions between tumor cells, non-malignant cells, the extracellular matrix, and their combined effects on tumor cell growth, invasion, migration, and resistance to apoptosis ( Kobayashi et al. 1993 ). The end effect of interactions between malignant and non-malignant cells such as TAMs has been termed multicellular resistance ( Kobayashi et al. 1993 ). In more than 80% of epithelial cancers, tumor stage and disease prognosis correlate with tumor macrophage burden. TAMs are known to be present throughout solid MM tumors in both human and murine MMs and are thought to contribute to tumor development ( Bielefeldt-Ohmann et al. 1994 ; Hegmans et al. 2006 ). Multicellular resistance of TAMs may cause changes in the tumor microenvironment, including immunosuppression that can aid in the establishment of tumors or avoidance of immunodetection ( Mantovani et al. 2006 ). TAMs have also been shown to increase angiogenic and other growth factors that, when removed by ablation of TAMs via liposome-encapsulated clodronate (CLIP) in a murine model of diffuse peritoneal MM, leads to loss of cell/tumor survival, invasion, and metastatic properties ( Miselis et al. 2008 ).\nAlthough the TAMs in our study were present in large numbers and appeared to phagocytose both APMS-MB and APMS-BSA, their role in MM and particle trafficking is unclear. Macrophages can be divided into two phenotypes: the M1 “classically activated” and the M2 “alternatively activated” subtypes. Recent studies indicate that TAMs displaying an M2 phenotype are characterized by increased expression of interleukin (IL)–10 that enhances alternatively activated macrophage differentiation and production of CCL17 and CCL22 chemokines ( Mantovani et al. 2004 ; Miselis et al. 2008 ). In addition, the production of CCL17 and CCL22 recruits TH2 lymphocytes, thereby inhibiting TH1 cell function and creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment ( Mantovani et al. 2006 ).\nWe attempted here to quantify changes in tumor proportions of TAMs that may be in response to APMS-MB or APMS-BSA treatment and to evaluate if targeted microparticles were accumulating in tumors with an increased TAM burden. We did not discover any significant changes in TAM burden in established mesenteric tumors between targeted, non-targeted, or saline-treated MMs. However, we did demonstrate a significant reduction in TAM burden in the APMS-MB- and APMS-BSA-treated MMs in spheroid MMs at 24 hr, indicating our microparticles may have an effect on TAM recruitment to developing tumors. We hypothesize that if TAMs are contributing to the trafficking of microparticles to MM tissue, the contributions are not significantly changing the distribution of microparticles within the tissue between treatment groups, nor are APMS significantly altering the TAM component of the tumor microenvironment.\nIn summary, we have shown that APMS modified with an antibody to mesothelin provide a unique therapeutic delivery device that can be both imaged and targeted in an in vivo model of IP MM in SCID mice. We have previously shown that APMS preloaded with a therapeutic agent such as DOX can reduce MM tumor growth ( Hillegass et al. 2011 ), thus suggesting a novel platform for localized, targeted, multimodality treatments for MM. This approach may increase the efficacy of current chemotherapeutic treatments for MM and other intracavitary tumors while lowering systemic toxicity of drugs in patients.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Dr. Harvey I.

However, in 2008 the government announced its intention to invest £7 million into walking promotion. This article utilises Kingdon’s Multiple Streams framework as an organising principle through which to interrogate the reasons behind the increased emphasis on walking promotion as part of the public health policy agenda in England.\nMethods\nThe research adopted a case study design. Data were obtained through document analysis of relevant policies and semi-structured interviews with experts in the walking sector, including both government and non-government representatives.\nResults\nKingdon’s Multiple Streams theory proposes that at certain points in time, ‘policy windows’ are created through the convergence of a problem, an appropriate solution, and a receptive political environment, and this policy window presents an opportunity for major policy change. The findings of this research suggest that the success of London in securing the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games was the primary trigger in the creation of a policy window for walking promotion in recent years.\nConclusions\nDespite previous interest in walking promotion from the health and transport sectors, it was the recent alignment with the sports agenda that led to increased political commitment. This raises concerns that the research evidence on the health benefits of physical activity and rising levels of inactivity in England, are insufficient to secure government support and investment, and that multi-sector lobbying and joined-up political action may be critical in advancing this agenda.\nKeywords\nPublic healthPolicyWalkingEnglandMultiple Streams\nBackground\nEpidemiological research clearly demonstrates that adults who are physically active have a reduced risk of developing many non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, hypertension, and type II diabetes [ 1 ]. Despite these benefits, modernisation, urbanisation, and advances in technology have led to reductions in physical activity levels globally [ 2 ]. In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that more than 30 % of adults worldwide did not engage in sufficient levels of physical activity to benefit their health and prevent disease [ 3 ]. Consequently, physical inactivity has been identified as the fourth leading risk factor for premature mortality, accounting for an estimated 6 % of global mortality (3.2 million deaths annually) [ 4 ]. In England, recent surveillance data suggests that over 40 % of adults are failing to meet recommended physical activity levels [ 5 ]. As a result, physical inactivity is thought to cause 3.1 % of morbidity and mortality in England, and is responsible for 35,000 deaths annually [ 6 ].\nBrisk walking is a ‘sufficient’ activity to benefit health [ 7 – 9 ] and is viewed as one of the most acceptable and accessible forms of physical activity [ 10 ]. Walking is free of charge, does not require specialist equipment or facilities, and can be easily incorporated into everyday life. Walking is an ideal introduction to physical activity for people who are overweight or extremely unfit [ 11 ], and being a low impact activity, walking poses relatively few risks of injury [ 12 ]. For these reasons, walking has been identified as the form of activity with the greatest potential for increasing the overall activity levels of an inactive population [ 9 , 13 ] and also as the most likely way that all adults can achieve recommended physical activity levels [ 14 ].\nThere is increasing recognition among physical activity researchers, of the role of policy in addressing population levels of physical inactivity [ 15 , 16 ]. The development of a national policy framework is important to raise the profile of physical activity as a priority area and to provide a coherent action plan or programme of activities aimed at increasing population prevalence of physical activity [ 17 ]. Due to its broad accessibility and acceptability it has been proposed that “walking must be central to any strategy to increase physical activity” [ 18 ].\nPhysical activity and health began to be recognised as an issue requiring government support in England in the early 1990s. The ACTIVE for LIFE campaign, which was funded by the Department of Health (DH), aimed to raise awareness of the health benefits of being active and encourage regular physical activity as part of a healthy lifestyle. The campaign had a strong focus on walking, but was not accompanied by a strategic plan or investment in infrastructure or programs to support physical activity behaviour change.\nDespite initial leadership for the physical activity and health agenda from DH, the Department for Transport (DfT) began to recognise the role of walking and cycling in meeting its objectives around reducing congestion and carbon emissions. In 1996 DfT published a National Cycling Strategy [ 19 ] and announced its intentions to develop a national walking strategy [ 20 ]. Although a strategy to promote walking did not emerge until 2004, this also came from DfT in the form of Walking and Cycling: An Action Plan.\nPhysical activity promotion generally, and walking promotion specifically, has the potential to contribute to the aims and objectives of a wide range of government departments. In addition, many of the actions to promote walking fall within the remit of different departments such as health, transport, education, environment, and urban planning. Thus there has been no natural ‘home’ for walking promotion, which has presented challenges to developing a coherent and coordinated national policy.\nSince the early 2000s, several non-government organisations have established large scale walking initiatives. For example, the Countryside Agency established the national ‘Walking for Health’ programme (originally known as the Walking the Way to Health Initiative) and also the National Step-O-Meter Programme. These activities were traditionally funded through agencies such as the British Heart Foundation and the Big Lottery, as opposed to the government. However, in 2008 the government announced its intention to invest £7 million in a programme of “innovative campaigns to encourage people to walk more” [ 21 ]. This level of commitment and investment in walking promotion was unprecedented and presented a real opportunity for those working in physical activity and walking promotion to develop and deliver large-scale interventions aimed at improving the nation’s health.\nIn order to move beyond simply a description of this example of policy development, this article turns to the study of policy agendas and considerations of how issues come to be issues in the first place, how agendas change over time, and the factors which determine why some issues are given more government attention than others [ 22 ]. The conceptual framework put forward in this article, Kingdon’s Multiple Streams theory [ 23 ], serves to shed light on and explain the increased emphasis on walking promotion as part of the public health policy agenda in England. In doing so, this paper aims to answer the following questions:\n1.\nMethods\nConceptual framework\nDue to the complex nature of the policy making process, a range of theories and conceptual frameworks have been developed; these constructs serve the purpose of focusing the policy analyst’s attention on important elements within the policy process, while helping the analyst to apply structure or typologies to an otherwise chaotic and unwieldy course of events. Kingdon’s Multiple Streams framework is particularly focused on the agenda setting process and, as such, lends itself to answering the questions posed in this article [ 23 ]. This framework suggests that the policy process consists of three distinct sets of processes or ‘streams’: 1) problems; 2) policies; and 3) politics. At key points in time the three streams are joined—a problem is recognised, an appropriate solution is identified, and the political ‘mood’ is right for the government to embrace and drive forward policy change. This confluence of the three streams is referred to as a ‘policy window’; a juncture at which an opportunity for major policy change can be grasped. Kingdon’s framework is put forward as a useful heuristic device with which to understand agenda setting and policy change.\nStudy design\nThe research adopted a case study design. Therefore the focus was on gaining in-depth insights into the political processes surrounding walking promotion in England, rather than making generalisations about the applicability of the findings to other cases. Data were obtained through document analysis and semi-structured interviews and triangulation techniques were used to verify the validity of the results [ 24 ]. The focus of the research was on the period up to October 2012. The study was approved by Loughborough University Research Ethics Committee.\nDocument analysis\nA literature and web search was undertaken to identify both past and present documents relevant to walking policy in England. The web-search mainly focused on the websites of DH, DfT, and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). Various search terms were used including ‘physical activity’, ‘active travel’ and ‘walking’, and all identified documents were considered. To ensure the comprehensive inclusion of relevant documents, all interviewees were asked to identify documents that they felt were important for understanding the development, content, and/or implementation of walking policy in England. Any documents which had not been previously identified were obtained and included in the analysis. A list of the key documents included in the analysis is provided in Table  1 .\nTable 1\nWalk England (2008).\n \nAlthough each of these organisations is concerned, in some way, with walking promotion, the aims and objectives of each organisation differ and include access to the countryside, pedestrian safety, and transport emissions. The organisations vary substantially in terms of their size and resources; the largest organisations are the Ramblers and Sustrans, while the smallest organisation is Walk England. The primary purpose was not to compare across cases but to consider each organisation’s perspective in order to reach well-rounded conclusions about the development and dynamics of walking promotion as a public health policy issue in England.\nKey representatives from each of these organisations were identified using existing knowledge of the organisations and by searching their respective websites. The selected interviewees were either the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (particularly for smaller organisations) or, if appropriate, the strategic lead for walking and/or health (particularly for organisations with a broader agenda). In addition, DH and DfT have been identified as the ‘main players’ in promoting physical activity for adults [ 25 ]. Interviews were conducted with representatives from each of these departments; the interviewees were the Head of Physical Activity and the Head of Active Travel, respectively.\nSnowball sampling was used to complement the purposive approach [ 26 ]. This involved asking each of the interviewees to identify other colleagues or acquaintances with relevant knowledge and experience who they felt would make a valuable contribution to the research. This approach led to the identification of interviewees from several other organisations including Intelligent Health (a limited company which aims to create physical activity opportunities close to where people live and work), Knowledge into Action (a charity focused on improving health and healthcare), and Sport England (the DCMS funded body responsible for the delivery of sport in England from grassroots to elite level), as well as several independent consultants and other known advocates.\nThe interview schedule typically included the following themes: how walking fits within the aims and objectives of the different organisations; the roles of the different NGOs within the broad field of walking promotion; which aspects of the broad walking agenda agencies are mostly closely aligned to; how the organisations are funded; who they are accountable to; the main programs that the organisations deliver; relationships/collaborations with other organisations; relationships with government; level of political influence of each NGO; perceptions of how the issue of walking has been dealt with by the government; and barriers to establishing greater political support and investment into walking promotion in England. The interview schedule for the government representatives included questions on: how responsibility for walking promotion has been allocated or dispersed across government; consultation and decision making processes related to the development of walking policy; the main challenges in developing and implementing policy to promote walking; and relationships and interactions with the key NGOs on walking related issues.\nFifteen interviews were conducted in total and took place between April and October 2012. The duration of interviews ranged from 35 min to two hours, and the typical length was one hour. All interviews were recorded on a digital audio device, with consent, and were subsequently transcribed verbatim. Each transcript was sent to the respective interviewee, to confirm that it accurately conveyed what was said or intended. In total, the interview data consisted of 285 pages of transcript.\nData analysis\nBoth the documents and the interview transcripts were uploaded into NVivo qualitative software package and analysed using inductive content analysis. Therefore, the coding categories and the names for each concept and theme were derived directly and inductively from the data. The coding themes were then allocated to one of the following three groupings: problems; policies; and politics, in order to analyse the results in relation to Kingdon's Multiple Streams framework [ 23 ]. To confirm the reliability of the analysis, all data were coded on two separate occasions, allowing the lead researcher to confirm or refine the coding system developed during the initial analysis.\nResults\nThe following section is set out according to the broad, yet distinct categories in Kingdon’s Multiple Streams framework: problems; policies; and politics. The article focuses on events and decisions taking part in each of these ‘streams’ before considering how these factors have converged to make a ‘policy window’ for increased support and investment in walking promotion in England.\nThe problem stream\nWalking levels in England have been in decline since the mid-1970s and this reduction in walking has been accompanied by an increase in car use [ 27 ]. The consequences of this shift include reduced overall physical activity levels, increased traffic congestion, and higher levels of carbon emissions. The problems associated with low levels of walking have been recognised by several well established interest groups/organisations, which formed a key focus of the empirical research. These types of interest groups play an important role in nearly every aspect of health policy, from bringing issues to the attention of government, proposing new policy options, and building pressure for action [ 28 ].\nIt is imperative that issues are defined in a way which will attract political interest. According to Weiss [ 29 ], issue definition is concerned with the organisation of a set of facts, beliefs, and perceptions, or ‘how people think about circumstances’. The way in which an issue is ‘packaged’ determines how it is perceived by both policymakers and the public and thus can impact upon the agenda-building process [ 30 ]. ‘Symbols’, which can be described as “objects to which people attach political significance”, are used to attract attention to an issue, to define an issue in a specific way, and to mobilise support for specific policy options over others [ 30 ]. The issue of walking promotion has been defined or ‘packaged’ in three primary ways: as a health issue; a transport issue; and as an environment issue; and this has impacted on how responsibility for walking promotion has been dealt with by the government. A senior staff member from the Ramblers stated, for example:\n“I think it has been spread between transport and health and environment… and it’s kind of shifted and moved around depending on whether you’re talking about the countryside or whether you’re talking about urban walking, or obesity or issues like that” (London, May 2012).\nSometimes recognition that a problem exists is sufficient for the problem to make it onto the political agenda; however there are usually many problems competing for recognition, meaning that only a fraction of them make it into the formal process of political deliberations. Which problems receive government attention is often influenced by ‘policy entrepreneurs’ [ 23 , 31 ]. These entrepreneurs are highly motivated individuals who seek to raise the profile of an issue among both government officials and the general public. Policy entrepreneurs typically hold positions of leadership within relevant interest groups and are usually well connected politically. The main roles of an entrepreneur are to define and reframe problems, advocate new ideas, specify policy alternatives, broker ideas among policy actors, mobilise public opinion, and help set the decision-making agenda [ 32 ].\nThere have been several long standing advocates for walking promotion, who have been instrumental in bringing the issue to the attention of government and for encouraging political action. These include Dr William Bird, a general practitioner who was instrumental in the establishment of the national led walk program Walking for Health, and Sir Muir Gray, who has held several senior positions in preventive health and has been described as a “a ceaseless champion of walking as a means of tackling obesity and inactivity” [ 33 ]. A former employee at DH reflected on the powerful influence of these types of policy entrepreneurs:\n“They can walk the talk. They brought good examples of what was happening elsewhere… you talk about people being influential and stuff like that. It's a fact of life that certain people will like other people and listen to what they say. And it happens more than you could ever believe in terms of someone having the ear of a Minister” (London, July 2012).\nThe lobbying efforts of these policy entrepreneurs have been facilitated by several factors including growing research evidence on the health benefits of walking [ 9 , 10 ] and prevalence data on rising levels of inactivity, for example from the ‘Allied Dunbar Fitness Survey’ [ 34 ], and more recently the Health Survey for England [ 5 , 35 ]. One of the biggest challenges for these policy entrepreneurs, however, has been to convince policymakers that walking promotion legitimately falls within the government’s remit. There is a long history of policy in England which emphasises the importance of individuals taking responsibility for their own health behaviours. For example, Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation [ 36 ], identified behavioural risk factors such as smoking and physical activity as an individual responsibility and beyond the remit of the government. Even some of the more recent policy documents, including Healthy Lives, Healthy People—A Call to Action on Obesity in England [ 37 ], emphasise the need for individuals to take responsibility for their own health by making healthier lifestyle choices. Therefore the challenge has not only been to convince the government of the magnitude and consequences of the problem of low walking levels but also to convince them that dealing with the problem is a government responsibility.\nAn additional barrier to walking promotion, which was expressed by representatives from both DH and DfT, is the perception that walking is such a simple behaviour that the general public will not view walking promotion as sufficiently complex or necessitating high level expertise, to warrant political attention, and thus this will not be considered an appropriate use of scarce government resource. This sentiment is captured by the following quote from a senior government official:\n“Governments can feel a little foolish promoting walking in a sense that it's a Daily Mail headline—Government tells people to walk!—Government gives people lessons on walking! Suddenly you can be ridiculed because it’s such a natural thing to do” (London, April 2012).\nThe policy stream\nThe linking of solutions to policy problems is thought to increase the chances of gaining political attention and support for an issue. Having pre-formulated policy solutions can increase the government’s confidence that there are appropriate solutions to the identified problem and thus that the problem can be dealt with in a timely fashion without the need for drawn-out political deliberations on appropriate policies. Therefore once one or more problems are identified, ‘policy communities’, consisting of experts in the area, try to affix solutions to the problem, usually driven by their own values and interests [ 38 ].\nEach of the key walking organisations has conceptualised different policy solutions, including led walk schemes, infrastructure changes to improve the environment for walking, and resources such as websites and maps. Multiple Streams theory holds that the survival of ideas and solutions in the policy stream is determined by three factors.\nFirst, the degree of technical feasibility, which relates to how easily a theoretically sound idea can actually be translated into practice. Ideas that can make the transition from theory to practice with the least difficulty are thought to stand a better chance of survival.\nSecond, survival is determined by whether solutions are widely supported by a range of specialists within the policy community. The more wide-spread support there is for a policy solution, the greater the likelihood that the solution will be adopted.\nThe third factor relates to budgetary implications, with less costly solutions often receiving a greater level of support from policymakers [ 22 ].\nIn recent years two walking programmes have received substantial government resource; Natural England’s Walking for Health programme and Walk England’s Walk4Life Miles project, which received £3 million and £1.4 million respectively from DH in 2008. Natural England’s Walking for Health programme is a led walk initiative, established in 2000. Walking for Health had already expanded into a national programme and in 2010 the programme consisted of over 600 local schemes, all of which were delivered by a network of over 11,000 trained volunteers [ 39 ]. This programme, in many ways, met Kingdon’s proposed criteria for survival within the policy stream. Walking for Health had a proven track record of feasibility, the programme had widespread support from various stakeholders (and particularly Dr William Bird), and it could be delivered at relatively low cost due to the engagement of a large network of (existing) volunteers.\nWalk England’s Walk4Life Miles project was a new initiative which would involve setting up 2012 one mile sign-posted walking routes across the country. It was envisaged that the one-mile routes would be safe, attractive, and connected to where people live, and that people would be able to use the miles to test their fitness, using the principles of the Rockport One-Mile Walk Test [ 40 ]. The aim of the project was to get 30,000 people to improve their fitness and sustain an increase in physical activity [ 41 ]. The simplicity of this intervention would facilitate judgements of feasibility and cost and, although there was not wide spread support for the initiative from the walking sector as a whole, it was lobbied for fiercely by Walk England, as illustrated by the following quote:\n“I found out that Walk England had snaffled a million quid… the reason that happened was that [they] never got off the phone from [the Department of Health]. They badgered, badgered, badgered, badgered and badgered. And just badgered [the Department of Health] so badly that in the end that’s what happened” (London, May 2012).\nAlthough the ‘evidence-based policy movement’ has sought to promote the rigorous analysis of policy options in order to improve decision-making [ 42 , 43 ], the findings of this research lend support to Head’s suggestion that policy development is often based more on politics and professional judgement, rather than on research evidence alone [ 43 ], and highlights the influence that key ‘policy entrepreneurs’ can have in the decision making process.\nThe politics stream\nThe politics stream relates to the political ‘mood’ and openness to change based on the current political climate [ 22 , 23 ]. Clearly a range of factors such as impending elections, a change in government, and interest group activity can lead to the inclusion or exclusion of different topics on the political agenda, as well as influencing how these problems are perceived by the electorate and policymakers, and how potential solutions are evaluated.\nIn July 2005 it was announced that London would host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Subsequently DCMS released Before, During and After: Making the Most of the London 2012 Games [ 21 ], which outlined the Government’s intention to make the UK a world-leading sporting nation. However a key feature of both the bid and the subsequent policy was the promise of delivering a ‘physical activity legacy’ which would inspire population increases in sport and physical activity, or, as one interviewee summarised it, political interest in physical activity and walking promotion was bolstered by the world’s largest sports mega-event: “The driver, I would say, was the Olympics, because funding was allocated to help meet that target” (London, July 2012).\nSpecifically this policy identified the target of getting two million more people ‘active’ by 2012, and committed to investing £7 million into walking promotion as a key approach to achieving this target. Interestingly, the basis of this legacy is the belief that elite sport success can act as a catalyst for increased physical activity and sport participation among the masses; a belief that has little evidence from previous sports mega-events [ 44 – 47 ].\nThe ‘policy window’\nAt key points in time the three streams outlined above are joined together: a problem is recognised, an appropriate solution is identified, and the political ‘mood’ is right for the government to embrace and drive forward policy change. This confluence of the three streams is referred to by Kingdon as a ‘policy window’.\nThe success of London in securing the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games was the primary trigger in the creation of a policy window for walking promotion in recent years. The profile of hosting this mega-event meant that political interest was high, and the subsequent promise of delivering a physical activity legacy provided a ‘problem’ in that the government were now required to provoke large scale increases in physical activity [ 21 , 48 ]. Time and resources were allocated to delivering this target and thus the government were seeking appropriate policy solutions in which to invest. A former employee at DH recollected on this situation:\n“We had a target to meet and we had to get two million people active so we had to find programmes that would do that and it was very clear that the biggest potential was in walking. I think what possibly wasn’t clear was what the right interventions were” (London, July 2012).\nTherefore, the role of interest groups and policy entrepreneurs was to identify appropriate policy solutions and to convince the government of their value. Two organisations were successful in this endeavour, Natural England and Walk England.\nA key feature of the policy window however, is that as quickly as it opens, it may close, due to other competing agendas or simply a change in the political ‘climate’. In May 2010 there was a general election and a change in government. When the new government came into power, the UK (and the rest of the world) was in the midst of an economic recession. In an attempt to address the economic crisis the coalition government undertook a review of non-departmental public bodies, including Natural England. The review concluded that Walking for Health was peripheral to Natural England’s core objectives and was not something that it should be delivering. A competitive tendering process ensued and in March 2012, the Ramblers took over the coordination of the Walking for Health programme [ 49 ].\nIn addition, there was a Treasury review of the public spending commitments made by the previous government between 1st January 2010 and the General Election [ 50 ]. This review examined £34 billion of spending that was approved during the previous government’s final few months in office. The aim of the review was to assess whether these commitments were affordable, whether they would deliver value for money, and whether they were considered a priority for the new government. In total 12 projects were cancelled because they were deemed unaffordable and not a government priority, one of which was Walk England’s Walk4Life Miles project. This is an example of the ‘window of opportunity’ closing due to a change in politics.\nDiscussion\nThis article reports on the application of Kingdon’s Multiple Streams theory to explain the recent rise of walking promotion on the political agenda in England. The framework provided a useful structure for the study of agenda setting in this discrete area of policy, thus reinforcing the utility and wide applicability of Kingdon’s Multiple Streams theory for policy analysis.\nThe analysis identified the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games as the primary driver behind the government’s increased interest in walking promotion in England. Both the 2012 Games bid and the subsequent policy used the rhetoric of inspiring population level increases in physical activity. It is interesting to note that despite a long-standing interest in walking from DH and DfT, it was alignment with the sports agenda that led to increased investment in walking promotion in recent years. This is supported by the concept of ‘generalisation of interests’ which proposes that if policy entrepreneurs are able to demonstrate the relevance of an issue to a broad audience (and a range of government departments), this increases the appeal of the issue and the likelihood of securing government engagement and support [ 51 , 52 ].\nThe £7 million investment into walking promotion in 2008 was motivated by the perceived potential of sports mega-events to lead to population level increases in sport and physical activity participation; however, there is little evidence to support this notion [ 44 – 47 ]. Hosting sports mega-events does, however, generate political interest and thus sport can be a strong ‘symbol’ for getting physical activity onto the political agenda. Therefore further research is needed to understand how these events may be better utilised as a vehicle for encouraging mass participation in sport and physical activity. It should be noted that linking physical activity promotion with sports mega-events alone is insufficient, as it fails to recognise the importance of physical activity as a critical lifestyle behaviour for the prevention and control of NCDs. In addition, this sort of interest and commitment is often short-lived and is not sustained beyond the event itself. In the case of the London 2012 Games, the target of getting two million more people active as a result of hosting the Games was dropped even before the event took place [ 53 , 54 ].\nFollowing the government’s promise to deliver a physical activity ‘legacy’ as a result of hosting the Games, it committed to investing in a suite of “innovative campaigns to encourage people to walk more” [ 21 ]. The government elected to fund two walking initiates; Natural England’s Walking for Health programme and Walk England’s Walk4Life Miles project, neither of which were supported by a robust scientific evidence base.\nAlthough there is some evidence that walking in groups is an effective approach to increasing physical activity levels [ 55 ], relatively little is known about the effectiveness of other approaches to encourage people to walk more. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advocate for action to promote both leisure and transport related walking [ 14 ], through a range of portfolios including leisure services, parks, transport, and the environment, however further research is needed on exactly what types of interventions are effective and cost-effective.\nIn the absence of strong evidence of effectiveness, the lobbying efforts of policy entrepreneurs will be particularly critical. In addition it is advantageous to package interventions in a way which attracts political interest and aligns with other government priorities. In recent years, Walk England were particularly successful in this regard; the concept of 2012 routes gave this intervention a (albeit loose) connection to the 2012 Games and provided DH with a clear policy solution linked to the legacy target. Thus although the initiative was innovative, lacked a sound theoretical or empirical evidence base, and did not meet Kingdon’s criteria of having wide-spread support, Walk England were able to secure government investment.\nFurther research is clearly needed to build the evidence base on effective walking interventions. In the meantime, lobbying for interventions which lack evidence of effectiveness should be undertaken with caution. If these programs do not lead to the desired outcome in terms of increasing physical activity levels, they will have the adverse effect of undermining the government’s trust and confidence, which is likely to lead to reductions in future support and investment.\nEvidently there is still work to be done to a) raise awareness of the health benefits of physical activity; b) emphasise the importance and potential of walking promotion for influencing population levels of physical activity; c) build the evidence base on effective approaches to promoting walking; and d) encourage the development and implementation of policy level actions, with sustained support and investment, to increase population levels of physical activity and reduce NCD prevalence.\nConclusion\nThis paper utilised Kingdon’s Multiple Streams framework as an organising principle through which to interrogate the reasons behind the government’s increased interest and investment in walking promotion in 2008. Overall it appears that government interest in walking promotion in England has largely been motivated by sport and the promise of delivering a ‘legacy’ as a result of hosting the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. This raises concerns that the research evidence on the health benefits of physical activity and rising levels of inactivity in England, are insufficient to secure government support and investment, and that multi-sector lobbying and joined-up political action may be critical in advancing this agenda.\nDeclarations\nAcknowledgements\nThis manuscript is an output from the lead author’s PhD research which was undertaken at Loughborough University and supervised by Professor Barrie Houlihan.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors’ contributions\nKM collected the data, undertook the analysis, and prepared the draft manuscript.

This study will evaluate the impact of Communities First on residents’ mental health and social cohesion.\nMethods and analysis A prospective controlled quasi-experimental study of the association between residence in Communities First regeneration areas in Caerphilly county borough and change in mental health and social cohesion. The study population is the 4226 residents aged 18–74 years who responded to the Caerphilly Health and Social Needs Study in 2001 (before delivery) and 2008 (after delivery of Communities First). Data on the location, type and cost of Communities First interventions will be extracted from records collected by Caerphilly county borough council. The primary outcome is the change in mental health between 2001 and 2008. Secondary outcomes are changes: in common mental disorder case status (using survey and general practice data), social cohesion and mental health inequalities. Multilevel models will examine change in mental health and social cohesion between Communities First and control areas, adjusting for individual and household level confounding factors. Further models will examine the effects of (1) different types of intervention, (2) contamination across areas, (3) length of residence in a Communities First area, and (4) population migration. We will carry out a cost-consequences analysis to summarise the outcomes generated for participants, as well as service utilisation and utility gains.\nEthics and dissemination This study has had approval from the Information Governance Review Panel at Swansea University (Ref: 0266 CF). Findings will be disseminated through peer-review publications, international conferences, policy and practice partners in local and national government, and updates on our study website ( http://medicine.cardiff.ac.uk/clinical-study/communities-first-regeneration-programme/ ).\nMENTAL HEALTH\nPUBLIC HEALTH\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nThis is an Open Access article distributed in accordance with the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt and build upon this work, for commercial use, provided the original work is properly cited.

It is estimated that in the over past 20 years £11 billion has been spent on these schemes in the UK. 1 These regeneration schemes are typically designed to improve the likelihood of employment, education and social support within economically deprived communities, rather than to directly improve health. The interventions delivered in these schemes therefore include a broad range of regeneration activities to: (1) improve the built environment: increase access to public transport, create or maintain green space, (2) improve housing quality: provide free loft insulation, double glazing, 2 , 3 (3) reduce crime and promote safety: install street lighting, alarms, traffic calming and pedestrian zones, (4) reduce environmental stressors such as litter and noise, and (5) promote social support and contact between residents: by building or staffing youth clubs, providing sports equipment; setting up luncheon or widows clubs. 4 Although there has been a number of systematic reviews examining on the health impacts of housing improvement, 5 , 6 and a few evaluations area-regeneration schemes on short-term changes in employment, education and income, 7 , 8 there is a dearth of evidence on the effectiveness of area-wide regeneration schemes on health outcomes. 1\nWe identified three studies which have evaluated the impact of area-regeneration schemes on mental health. 9 , 10 An evaluation of the New Deal for Communities, delivered in deprived areas in England, found no difference in the change in mental health scores (2002–2008) between residents of New Deal areas and residents randomly sampled from non-contiguous comparator areas 9 ; or participants in the Health Survey for England stratified according to levels of area deprivation. 10 An evaluation of the Go Well regeneration programme, based in Glasgow reported a small improvement in mental health was associated with housing repairs and improvements, but no difference in mental health between residents living in intervention areas being demolished compared to residents from matched control areas. 11\n‘Communities First’ is a Welsh Assembly Government programme of area-wide regeneration delivered in the most deprived communities in Wales. Communities First has spent around £300 million up until 2012 (equivalent to an average of some £200 000 per community or around £55 per resident per annum). 12 To date, evaluations of Communities First have included two reports based on process data which suggested the scheme was viewed positively by residents and may have had a beneficial effect on physical health 13 , 14 ; and another evaluation of the Communities First Support Network made recommendations on how best to support the Communities First programmes. 15 A comparison across Wales between residents who did and did not live in a Communities First area using routine government data aggregated at a small area level suggested there was very little impact on levels of unemployment, unemployment benefit, educational achievement and crime. There was, however, no evaluation of Communities First on mental health. 14\nThe proposed study exploits an opportunity to nest a prospective controlled quasi-experimental study to investigate the effects of Communities First within an electronic record-linked prospective cohort, the Caerphilly Health and Social Needs Electronic Cohort Study (eCATALYsT). 16 We will collect information on the type, location and costs of Communities First interventions in Caerphilly which will be anonymously record-linked to eCATALyST study. The eCATALyST study collected data on mental health, social cohesion before and after the Communities First programme, from residents who did and did not reside in Communities First areas, as well as providing detailed assessments on changes in household and individual-level socioeconomic status. We will also collect mental health data from general practice to triangulate results derived from cohort and routine data.\nAims and objectives\nThis study will examine the association between residence in a Communities First area and changes in mental health and social cohesion in a prospective controlled quasi-experimental, or ‘natural experiment’ design, set in a general adult population sample. Our primary objective is to determine:\nWhat is the impact of the Communities First regeneration programme on mental health?\nThe interventions delivered as part of Communities First may also have an effect on levels of social cohesion. This association could occur through the positive individual and community effects of interventions on local friendship ties, collective attachment and rates of social participation. 17 It is also clear that selective population migration needs to be taken into account in any examination of health inequalities over time, 18 , 19 and that the costs and benefits of interventions need to be assessed. Our secondary objectives therefore are to determine:\nWhat is the impact of the Communities First regeneration programme on social cohesion?\nTo what extent does regeneration of a community result in population replacement rather than regeneration?\nWhat is the impact of the Communities First programme on area-level inequalities in mental health and well-being, taking population migration into account?\nTo what extent can the benefits of the Communities First programme be considered to represent value for money?\nMethods and analysis\nStudy design\nThe study will utilise intervention data and the eCATALyST study to create a prospective controlled quasi-experimental study—a ‘natural experiment’. 20\nSetting\nThe study will be set in Caerphilly county borough, Wales, UK. Caerphilly borough has a population of around 178 000 with a large variation in levels of deprivation. 21 Communities First intervention areas account for roughly one-third of the lower super output areas (LSOAs) in Caerphilly and one-quarter of the resident population.\nParticipants\nData have been collected from 4426 participants aged 18–74 years on 31 May 2001 who responded to the 2001 and 2008 waves of the Caerphilly Health and Social Needs Electronic cohort study. 16 The prospective controlled quasi-experimental study involves a comparison of the 1773 (40%) participants living in 47 LSOAs that received Communities First interventions between the two waves of data collection, with 2653 participants living in 63 LSOAs that did not receive any interventions (control areas; see figure 1 ).\nDownload powerpoint\nFigure 1\nThe 47 Communities First intervention lower super output areas (LSOAs) and 63 control LSOAs in Caerphilly County Borough (Wales, UK).\nUse of existing record-linked datasets: the Secure Anonymous Information Linkage databank\nThe Secure Anonymous Information Linkage (SAIL) databank held within the Health Information Research Unit (HIRU) at Swansea University contains health, social and education data on three million residents of Wales, UK, and currently includes 13 data sets containing nearly one billion records. 22 , 23 Information governance for SAIL is overseen by an Information Governance Review Panel. 22 The smallest geographical area for which data are already linked and may be released from the databank, after scrutiny for small numbers, is the 2001 Census LSOA.\nThe Welsh Demographic Service (WDS) data set held by NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS), the NHS organisation in Wales mandated to hold personally identifiable data, contains addresses for all individuals who register with a general practitioner (GP). Dates for each address record update are held, thereby providing durations of residency for several different homes and the ability to link to local environment exposures at each. This data set will be used to track population migration and record length of exposure in a Communities First area. The WDS contains address information linked anonymously at the individual level (the anonymised linking field, ALF) which is the primary key variable for record-linkage. Using a split-file technique, NWIS supplies ALFs for the whole population of Wales to the SAIL databank. 22 , 23\nCommunities first intervention data\nWe will extract detailed data on each regeneration activity, including a text description, geographical location, duration and investment (£) using information held by Caerphilly county borough council. We propose to classify the interventions delivered as part of Communities First into seven domains of regeneration, informed by a scheme used to organise projects funded by the New Deal for Communities. 4 Examples are provided below.\nCrime. Reducing crime and the fear of crime through installing CCTV, street lighting and alarms;\nEducation. Providing educational support through after school/breakfast/holiday clubs, early learning and Sure Start;\nHealth. Projects to improve the health of residents directly through provision of sport equipment, staffing of sports clubs, health improvement interventions such as healthy eating projects;\nHousing and the physical environment. Housing maintenance and repairs, environmental improvement such as redevelopment of waste land, maintenance of green space, parks, building of play grounds; building and maintenance of roads and cycle paths;\nEmployment. Improving employment prospects included providing advice to businesses; projects to develop of computer skills of the unemployed;\nCommunity. Increasing social contact and participation including the building of community facilities, staffing of youth projects, funding of luncheon and widows clubs and community events;\nInfrastructure. Spending on the running of the partnerships. This entailed spending on staff, stationary, and training.\nThe classification scheme may be amended following extraction of all information on interventions.\nThe Caerphilly Health and Social Needs Electronic Cohort (eCATALyST)\nThe Caerphilly Health and Social Needs Electronic Cohort (eCATALyST) is a prospective cohort study residents of Caerphilly county borough, Wales, UK. The study has been described in detail elsewhere. 16 Briefly, in 2001 a stratified random sample of 22 236 individuals aged 18 and above resulted in 10 892 respondents providing valid information on mental health. In 2008 the survey was repeated with 9551 participants who still resided in the borough. Of these, 4798 returned questionnaires, with 4426 providing data on their mental health at both waves. The study has detailed information on a wide range of social, demographic and economic risk factors (eg, age, gender, socioeconomic status, educational achievement, employment, household income, council tax band) health and lifestyle outcome data (eg, cardiovascular risk factors, SF-36v2 for the Mental Health Inventory (MHI) scale, 24 limiting long-term illness), and perceptions of neighbourhood, including the Buckner Neighbourhood Cohesion scale. 25\nData from general practice on consultations and prescribing\nThe SAIL databank currently contains data on consultations and prescribing data for around 40% of the Welsh population. To date, data from 9 of the 29 GP practices in Caerphilly borough are record-linked in SAIL. This data will be used to compare information on common mental disorders from the eCATALyST data set to that defined using data from general practice. We have already defined a set of Read codes used by general practice to define a case of common mental disorder. 26 Although only around one-third of the survey data set respondents will have linked GP data, this provides an opportunity to compare results for common mental disorders reported in the community survey to those that present to primary care.\nPrimary outcome: mental health\nData on changes in mental health will be assessed using the 2001 and 2008 waves of eCATALyST. Mental health was assessed in 2001 and 2008 using the MHI (MHI-5) included in the SF-36 V.2 scale. 27 , 28 The validity and reliability of the MHI-5 are well established 28 and the scores reflect the continuously distributed nature of mental health status in the population. 27 , 28 Respondents can achieve a total score within a range of 5–25, which can be transformed to a 0–100 scale. 29 , 30 The primary outcome measure for the analysis is change in mental health score, wave 2–wave 1, so that positive values indicate an improvement in mental health.\nWe will repeat our analysis using a set of Read codes used by general practice to represent the common mental disorders. The specific set of codes will build on work conducted by our group using data from general practice to define a common mental disorder. 26 They will include codes for symptoms, diagnosis and treatments for psychiatric illnesses such as anxiety disorders and major depression.\nSecondary outcome measures\nSocial cohesion\nSocial cohesion was measured in both waves of eCATALyST study using a modified version of Buckner's Neighbourhood Cohesion Scale. 23 Social cohesion was measured using eight items: ‘I visit my friends in their homes’, ‘The friendships and associations I have with other people in my neighbourhood mean a lot to me’, ‘If I need advice about something I could go to someone in my neighbourhood’, ‘I believe my neighbours would help in an emergency’, ‘I borrow things and exchange favours with my neighbours’, ‘I would be willing to work together with others on something to improve my neighbourhood’, ‘I rarely have a neighbour over to my house to visit’ (reverse scored), and ‘I regularly stop and talk with people in my neighbourhood’. We will derive small-area social cohesion scores using our ecometric methodology. 31\nMental health inequalities\nThe eCATALyST study includes the following measures of socioeconomic position at both waves 16 : Registrar General Social Class and the National Statistics Socioeconomic Classification (NS-SEC) 32 ; housing tenure; council tax band of residence; full classification of employment status; and gross household income in two bands (above and below 60% of median income). Using the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) 2005 we will categorise each of the LSOAs into quintiles (based on four cut-points and equal counts of LSOAs) for aggregate analyses and use the WIMD score as a LSOA-level covariate in statistical models.\nSample size\nIn this prospective controlled quasi-experimental study the sample size is fixed and so we can calculate the power available to detect a clinically important difference in our primary outcome measure of mental health, the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5) scale scores between groups. Of the 4426 eligible survey participants, 1773 reside in 47 intervention LSOAs and 2653 in 63 control LSOAs. Comparing changes in the MHI-5 score between those living in regeneration areas and those living in control areas would have a power of 87% for detecting a difference of 2 in the mean score, allowing for clustering at LSOA-level. This is high power to detect a small, but clinically important, numerical difference in scores.\nStatistical analysis plan\nThe primary analysis will examine the association between changes in MHI-5 scores and residence in a Communities First intervention area or control area. Data on individuals nested within LSOAs will be available. Our analysis plan is:\nDescriptive statistics for change in mental health, social cohesion and socioeconomic covariates 2001–2008, comparing residents of Communities First and control areas;\nMultilevel linear models to examine changes in MHI-5 scores (2001–2008) and multilevel logistic models for the odds of a case of common mental disorder between residents of Communities First and control areas, adjusting for compositional characteristics including baseline age, gender and transitions in individual-level covariates recorded in eCATALyST. We will adjust for LSOA deprivation using quintiles of the 2005 Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD). 33 We will then include interaction terms to examine whether the effect of Communities First varies according to individual and LSOA-level social cohesion. To investigate the different types of interventions, we will repeat models replacing the binary term for residence in a Communities First or control area with a categorical term for the different types of interventions.\nIn order to address the secondary research questions:\nWe will fit further multilevel linear models described above to examine changes in levels of social cohesion;\nWe will assess the effect of population migration by including a term in these models for whether a participant has moved (yes/no) and whether that move was out of, or into, another Communities First LSOA. We will also compare a model, in which respondents are assumed not to have moved, with a model in which the correct migration is coded, following published methods. 19\nWe will examine the effect of Communities First on mental health inequalities by modelling interactions between residence in a Communities First area and (1) baseline area deprivation Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) 2005 scores 33 and, (2) population subgroups (eg, gender, employment status);\nA cost consequences analysis will be conducted and post-trial modelling employed to assess the cost consequences over longer time horizons than is possible within the study period. Changes in resources utilised over time in the Communities First areas relative to the control areas will be calculated and used in conjunction with the costs of setting up and delivering Communities First to generate the net cost of programme delivery per family; this will represent the incremental cost of providing the programme relative to usual service provision. The differences in primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes (including differences in utility scores derived from the SF-36 responses at each follow-up) will be used alongside the net cost of programme delivery to generate a set of indicators of relative cost-effectiveness within the study period, based on incremental cost and incremental outcomes. 34 These will be used to provide indicators of the extent to which the programme can be viewed as representing value for money.\nWe plan to conduct a number of sensitivity analyses to examine: (1) duration of exposure to Communities First by repeating models with length of residence rather than a binary term for exposure; and, (2) contamination using definitions of each type of intervention according to their likelihood for contamination. We will also explore analysis using propensity scores in an attempt to promote balance across intervention and control areas. We will write these models in MLWiN, 35 Stata, 36 or R. 37\nEthics and dissemination\nThe study has been approved by the Information Governance Review Panel (IGRP) at Swansea University (Ref: 0266 CF) to link the Communities First intervention data to outcome data from the eCATALyST study, general practice records, as well as the WDS within SAIL. The IGRP reviews all applications to the SAIL databank and members include senior representatives from the British Medical Association (BMA), the National Research Ethics Service (NRES), Public Health Wales, NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS) and Involving People. NRES does not consider that studies using only anonymised data require its approval. The eCATALyST study received ethical approval for the baseline survey 2001 from the former Gwent Local Research Ethics Committee (REF: JW/CC/00/59(a)) and for the wave 2 survey in 2008, approved by the SE Wales Research Ethics Committee Panel C (ref 08/WSE03/25).\nFindings will be disseminated through standard academic pathways including peer-review publications, presentations at national and international conferences, and updates on our study website ( http://medicine.cardiff.ac.uk/clinical-study/communities-first-regeneration-programme/ ). In addition, we will present our findings to policy partners in Caerphilly county borough, Public Health Wales, the Welsh Government, as well as the partnership boards who currently deliver Communities First.\nDiscussion\nThe proposed study is highly policy relevant. The Marmot Review of Health Inequalities has the creation of, “locally developed and evidence-based community regeneration programmes” as an objective to improve health and reduce health inequalities by 2020. 38 This study exploits an opportunity to construct a natural experiment to evaluate the impact of a multimillion pound national regeneration programme on mental health. We will extract data on the location and type of interventions and nest it within an anonymously record-linked prospective cohort (eCATALyST) so that we will have detailed assessments on individual and household-level social, economic and health-based confounding factors which have been linked with changes in mental health. These detailed assessments are not commonly available in routine data sources which are typically used in prospective controlled quasi-experimental studies. 20 , 39 These individual-level confounding factors will be important in our planned analysis in the attempt to separate out the effects of Communities First, delivered on the basis of residence in a deprived area, from that area and individual-level socioeconomic disadvantage. Through linkage to routine data we can also examine effects on common mental disorders that present in primary care and provide a more sensitive assessment of exposure to the interventions funded by Communities First through information on length of residence in a Communities First area provided by the WDS.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank the participants of the eCATALyST studies and many of the staff of Gwent Health Authority, the Caerphilly Local Health Group the Chief Executive's Office and the Electoral Services Department of Caerphilly county borough council for their help.

However, it is of considerable difficulties to precisely forecast the undispatchable and intermittent wind and solar power generations. The uncoordinated charging of PEVs imposes further challenges on the unit commitment in modern grid operations. In this paper, all these factors are comprehensively investigated for the first time within a novel hybrid unit commitment framework, namely UCsRP, which considers a wide range of scenarios in renewable generations and demand side management of dispatchable PEVs load. UCsRP is however an extremely challenging optimisation problem not only due to the large scale, mixed integer and nonlinearity, but also due to the double uncertainties relating to the renewable generations and PEV charging and discharging. In this paper, a meta-heuristic solving tool is introduced for solving the UCsRP problem. A key to improve the reliability of the unit commitment is to generate a range of scenarios based on multiple distributions of renewable generations under different prediction errors and extreme predicted value conditions. This is achieved by introducing a novel multi-zone sampling method. A comprehensive study considering four different cases of unit commitment problems with various weather and season scenarios using real power system data are conducted and solved, and smart management of charging and discharging of PEVs are incorporated into the problem. Test results confirm the efficacy of the proposed framework and new solving tool for UCsRP problem. The economic effects of various scenarios are comprehensively evaluated and compared based on the average economic cost index, and several important findings are revealed.\nDOI\nFinal published version\nScopus record\n""","7.508781","""https://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/a-comprehensive-study-of-economic-unit-commitment-of-power-systems-integrating-various-renewable-generations-and-plugin-electric-vehicles(930defe2-c9d4-460e-8334-d1e95df46ffc).html""","[-5.934759,54.583863]"

An improved sensor has now been completed with significant improvements in terms of signal to noise ratio and long-term stability. The improved sensor will be used to measure CO 2 concentrations on three different engines. The results will then be used to validate engine and catalyst models and to propose control strategies aimed at reducing overall emissions. A brief description of the sensor itself was presented.

The provision of ancillary services in the smart grid by electric vehicles is attractive to grid operators. Vehicles must be aggregated to meet the minimum power requirements of providing ancillary services to the grid. Likely aggregator revenues are insufficient to cover the additional battery degradation costs which would be borne by an existing electric vehicle owner. Moreover, aggregator revenues are insufficient to make electric vehicles competitive with conventional vehicles and encourage uptake by prospective consumers. Net annual costs and hourly compensation payments to electric vehicle owners were most sensitive to battery cost. The fleet provided firm fast reserve from 1900 h for 0.42 h, up to 2.7 h in the best cases. At best, likely aggregator revenue was 20 times less than the compensation required, up to 27,500 times at worst. The electric vehicle fleet may not be large enough to meet the firm fast reserve power and duration requirements until 2020. However, it may not be until 2030 that enough vehicles have been sold to provide this service cost-effectively. Even then, many more electric vehicles will be needed to meet the power level and duration requirements, both more often and for longer to enable participation in an all-day, everyday ancillary services market.\nItem Type:\n""","8.813648","""http://publications.eng.cam.ac.uk/738432/""",

This additional demand represents a significant proportion of daily electric load which requires greater or flexible generation and transmission and poses challenges to system security and stability. This paper considers the impact of EV integration on transient stability by using an equivalent model of the Northern Ireland (NI) power system. The paper proposes an AC/DC converter-based EV aggregator model with two typical EV connections. A range of typical faults is investigated and discussed through simulation. The critical clearing time (CCT) and transient stability margin are used to assess transient stability on the NI system. Simulation results indicate that in order to achieve and sustain 2020 EV integration targets and guarantee adequate transient stability, asset support and network reinforcement will be required and these outcomes are described in the paper.\nDocuments\nRights statement: Copyright 2017 IEEE.

However, with a myriad of powertrain architectures that are emerging in the industry, such as those in Electric Vehicles and Hybrid Vehicles, it becomes more challenging to carry out comprehensive comparative analyses across different permutations of powertrain topologies.This has motivated the authors to research on improving the method used to compare different types of powertrain architectures, and develop a tool that can be used by practitioners for this purpose. Literature survey has indicated that whilst there have been many comparisons made between different types of powertrains, such analyses were often carried out by comparing only limited types of architectures at a time. Additionally, many commercially available tools lack the combination of an optimization algorithm with the ability to simulate different combinations of powertrain architectures concurrently to provide a meaningful comparison.In this paper, a new approach is proposed that simultaneously optimizes powertrain architecture selection and component sizing. Results from this investigation have indicated that such analysis is indeed possible, and this was demonstrated by way of identifying the “transition point” between powertrain architectures. The investigation included the use of a multi-objective optimization with a novel powertrain framework. The capabilities of this framework potentially opens a way for vehicle manufacturers to quantify the benefits that can be achieved from each type of powertrain architecture, and help accelerate the implementation of alternative powertrain technology.\nEvent:\n""","1.0","""http://papers.sae.org/2014-01-1105/""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

This approach is especially useful when dealing with electrified platforms as on-board energy storage devices (such as fuel cells or batteries) have a lower energy density ratio [kJ/g]. Unfortunately within the tactical mobility context such information might not be readily available, either by passive obstructions, like mountains, or active ones due to jamming, etc. This paper will elaborate on an energy management system meant to deal with the uncertainty created by navigating in terrain where only basic trip information is available, such as probable distance to be travelled.The overall system is an integration of several intelligent subsystems which act together to create fuel/charge consumption forecasts, energy reserves for critical loads and finally guarantee that vital in-vehicle systems have sufficient energy available to operate at any given time inside a defined operating envelope.\nEvent:\n""","1.0","""http://papers.sae.org/2014-01-1911/""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

"""Cranfield_University""","""The Development and Deployment of a Maintenance Operations Safety SurveyHuman Factors - Marie Langer, Graham R. Braithwaite, 2016""","""Introduction\nSection:\nCollecting information from daily operations has substantial learning potential, allowing the causes of failures, their organizational roots, and successful recoveries to be identified ( O’Leary, 2002 ). Achieving an in-depth understanding of the error chain helps to develop specific management strategies ( Hobbs & Williamson, 2003 ) and to manage human error like any other business risk ( Reason & Hobbs, 2003 ). Predictive tools, such as flight data monitoring and the line operations safety audit (LOSA), provide information on routine operational performance. However, these tools are predominantly focused on flight operations. Other areas of the complex aviation system, like aircraft maintenance, remain reliant on reactive tools, such as investigations of reported events.\nDespite research efforts categorizing the types of human error (see Dhillon & Liu, 2006 ), the maintenance industry still lacks an understanding of maintenance errors in the organizational context ( Hobbs & Kanki, 2008 ). This lack of understanding is mainly because maintenance errors tend to remain hidden (latent), which makes them more challenging to detect ( Hobbs, 2004 ; Reason, 1997 ). Although the flight crew usually get feedback on their actions and see the operational effect almost immediately, the consequences of maintainers’ actions may not become apparent unless an incident or an accident occurs ( International Civil Aviation Organization [ICAO], 2002a ; McKenna, 2002 ). Hobbs (2004) highlights that until such unsafe actions are uncovered, maintainers may continue using the same unsafe practices.\nAircraft maintenance is considered a highly error-prone activity due to the extensive human involvement and system complexities ( Hobbs, 2008 ; Reason & Hobbs, 2003 ). Maintenance errors reduce safety margins and cause financial losses in terms of schedule disruptions; thus effective error management can lead to considerable cost savings ( Hobbs & Kanki, 2008 ).\nThe maintenance field suffers from a restricted supply of information about maintainer and system performance. Several researchers highlight that maintenance still shows signs of blame culture ( Hobbs, 2008 ; McDonald, 2006 ; Patankar & Taylor, 2004 ), which can discourage open reporting of maintenance errors ( Hobbs & Kanki, 2008 ). The volume of maintenance incident reports is 10 times lower than reports associated with flight operations (Nisula & Ward, cited in Ward, McDonald, Morrison, Gaynor, & Nugent, 2010 ; Patankar & Driscoll, 2004 ).\nMaintenance audits usually focus on quality control, regulatory compliance, and adherence to procedures but fail to effectively audit performance in progress ( McDonald, 2003 ; Reason & Hobbs, 2003 ). Given the evaluative conditions, maintainers are likely to alter their behavior. Dekker (2003) highlights that many organizations fail to understand and monitor the practical drift between procedures and practice, even though there is an apparent conflict between the managers’ perception of how work should be carried out (i.e., follow procedures to the letter) and actual performance, where rigorous adherence to procedures causes delays ( McDonald, Corrigan, Daly, & Cromie, 2000 ).\nLOSA, defined by 10 operating characteristics (see Table 1 ), is a tool designed to collect data during routine flight operations (see Klinect, Murray, Merritt, & Helmreich, 2003 ). Its origin dates to 1994, when the University of Texas was approached to develop an observational tool able to measure how well crew resource management training translates into actual flight operations. It uses peer-to-peer direct observations to capture how flight crew manage, or indeed, mismanage, everyday threats and errors. The observers (experienced and trained flight crew) write a “story” of a flight, which is then coded according to a threat and error management (TEM) framework. TEM takes into account the operational complexities (threats) that are always present in the system as well as active failures (flight crew errors) and responses to threats and errors. It provides structure for the data collection and enables the quantification of results ( Klinect, 2005 ).\nTable 1: LOSA Operating Characteristics\nTable 1: LOSA Operating Characteristics\nNote. LOSA = line operations safety audit.\nView larger version\nThe developers claim that by establishing flight crew trust, LOSA has the ability to collect information about flight crew performance much closer to operational reality than any other safety tool ( Klinect et al., 2003 ). It complements existing safety data sources and has the capability to assess safety margins, rationalize allocation of resources, and provide insights into flight crew shortcuts and workarounds and serves as a baseline for measuring organizational change ( Federal Aviation Administration [FAA], 2006 ; Ma et al., 2011 ; Thomas, 2004 ).\nLOSA was also successfully applied in air traffic control ( Henry et al., 2010 ; ICAO, 2008 ), the medical industry ( Helmreich, 2000 , 2003 ; Thomas, Sexton, & Helmreich, 2004 ), and recently, aircraft maintenance. The FAA in collaboration with the Air Transport Association in the United States developed a maintenance line operations safety assessment (M-LOSA), which collects observational data using checklists ( Ma et al., 2011 ) instead of written narratives. Checklists are simple to use, so observers require little training. They are also associated with low cost. However, the context of the observation cannot be fully captured ( Stanton et al., 2013 ), and the predefined codes limit what observers record ( Bakeman, 2000 ).\nIn this research we aimed to adapt the original LOSA concept (i.e., collecting narrative data) for maintenance operations. Even though analysis and coding of free text are very time-consuming and rather laborious ( Stanton et al., 2013 ), thoroughly written narratives can capture the complexities between the operational context and maintainer performance. They can be retrospectively coded for quality purposes and uncover previously unidentified codes, and a timeline can be produced to establish the links between threats, errors, and undesired states. Importantly, the narrative text helps to identify specific actions that maintainers employ in response to threats and errors.\nMethod\nSection:\nThis section describes the conceptual background and development (Study 1) of the maintenance operations safety survey (MOSS) and the empirical application of the developed tool (Study 2). The research project was conducted in accordance with the code of conduct and ethical guidelines of Cranfield University.\nStudy 1: MOSS Development\nWe aimed to test whether the 10 LOSA operating characteristics (see Table 1 ) can be applied in aviation maintenance. To achieve the aim, we studied the practicalities of conducting peer-to-peer observations and writing meaningful narratives in the maintenance context. We also tested whether the collected information could be quantified using the TEM framework.\nMOSS Design Considerations\nMaintenance environment versus flight operations\nMaintainers work in a hazardous ( Hobbs, 2008 ; Kinnison, 2004 ; Lind, 2008 ; Reason & Hobbs, 2003 ) and variable environment ( Reiman, 2011 ) frequently associated with poor lighting, temperature variations, humidity, noise, and other adverse conditions ( Strauch, 2004 ). In contrast, the flight deck offers the comfort of a uniform and a highly ordered and air-conditioned environment ( ICAO, 2002a ).\nAlthough flight operations appear to benefit from a culture wherein direct observations are embraced, maintainers are not regularly observed for training and assessment purposes ( Hobbs & Kanki, 2008 ). Therefore, the observer becomes more visible to the observed maintainer and may feel more intrusive than in flight operations. Maintainers move around the aircraft, collect spares from stores, and frequently return to the office to access documentation as part of a check/task. So rather than observing a maintainer discretely, the observer must follow the maintainer, potentially affecting the latter’s behavior. Although it is possible to keep a distance during certain tasks, such as a walk-around, the observer has to get much closer when accessing the cabin and the flight deck.\nUnit of observation\nThe first step in adapting the LOSA methodology was to identify a common unit or event that could be observed as a complete phenomenon from beginning to end ( Wilkinson, 2000 ). In flight operations, this common unit is a flight, with clear starting and finishing points, always following the same flight phases (e.g., taxi out, take-off, climb, cruise). This common breakdown means that the collected information can be compared across flights independently from other attributes, such as the operator, departure or arrival points, or the length of the flight.\nIn line maintenance, scheduled tasks are usually organized into a check (e.g., transit, daily, weekly). Unscheduled tasks, such as troubleshooting and defect rectification, may be performed outside of a scheduled check. Irrespective of the type, any maintenance task follows three stages as per the manufacturers’ publications: setup, procedure, and close-up ( Liston, 2005 ). This deconstruction is considered equivalent to the flight phases. Therefore, a line check including a set of tasks (both scheduled and unscheduled) and involving all three stages represents the unit of observation.\nThe setup stage includes any tasks conducted in preparation for the check and usually takes place in the line office before attending to the aircraft. This stage may involve reviewing and printing documentation, preparing tools and spares, and communicating with other members of the team. The procedure stage starts when the maintainer arrives at the allocated aircraft. During this stage, the maintainer carries out the tasks required by the specific checklist and defect rectification according to the technical log or any other tasks communicated from maintenance control. This stage finishes with the maintainer having completed all required tasks and returning back to the line office. During the close-up stage, the maintainer carries out necessary actions to complete the line check, (e.g., complete appropriate company documentation), which usually takes place in the line office.\nTEM in the maintenance context\nA systematic observation requires a coding scheme so measurement can occur. Categories or codes are an important means of retrieving and organizing segments of text relating to particular themes ( Miles & Huberman, 1994 ), in this case, to MOSS TEM definitions. This section therefore outlines the key TEM definitions and the initial subcategories of the TEM model applicable in the maintenance context.\nBefore conducting test observations, the TEM code lists for flight operations published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA; 2010) , ICAO (2002b) , and Klinect (2005) were examined. The researcher and an experienced maintainer jointly reviewed all of these sources. The aim was to select relevant TEM subcategories and propose other appropriate threat and error subcategories that reflect the maintenance operational complexities. Utilizing existing categories as a provisional “start list” prior to fieldwork is recommended in research literature ( Miles & Huberman, 1994 ).\nThe top-level categories (threats, errors, and undesired states) come from the TEM framework and represent mutually exclusive categories, as defined by the developers ( Klinect, 2005 ).\nThreats are events or errors that occur outside the influence of the maintainer, increase the operational complexity of a task, and require the maintainer’s attention and management if safety margins are to be maintained. Following the review process, we identified two threat types for MOSS: environmental and organizational. In addition to weather threats, the environmental category also includes factors related to the air traffic control (ATC), airport authority, and external operational pressure. These four subcategories have similar characteristics. The organization has no influence over their occurrence and frequency. For example, the allocation of aircraft stands for arrivals, departures, and overnight parking is controlled solely by the local airport authority. Therefore, if a maintainer is in the middle of a line check and the airport authority requests the aircraft to be towed, it will have an implication on the task in progress and the overall check. Organizational threats originate within the organization. The subcategories are defined according to the source of the threat, such as flight or cabin crew, dispatch, maintenance control center, aircraft, and so on. For example, inaccurate information about a defect in the technical log written by the flight crew represents a threat for the maintainer addressing the specific defect and falls under the category “organizational threats–flight/cabin crew.”\nErrors are defined as maintainer actions or inactions that lead to a deviation from maintainer intentions or organizational expectations and reduce or have the potential to reduce safety margins. Following the review process, we identified three types of errors for MOSS: aircraft handling, communication, and procedural. Aircraft-handling errors include incorrect interactions with aircraft systems and task action errors, such as installation error, removal of wrong parts, or servicing errors. Procedural errors are defined as maintainer deviations from regulations or company standard operating procedures. For example, a maintainer performing a transit check without the relevant documentation commits a procedural error coded under the category “checklists/worksheets.” Written communication errors, such as technical log entries, are also considered procedural and fall under “documentation errors.” Communication errors include inadequate or absent verbal communication between maintainers or between maintainers and external personnel, such as flight crew, cabin crew, or ground agents.\nUndesired states are maintainer error–induced states or situations that reduce or have the potential to reduce safety margins. An undesired state is always preceded by an error. According to the TEM model, all threats, errors, and undesired states have to be recoverable/manageable ( Klinect, 2005 ), which means that normal operations can be regained following the threat/error management. This is an important characteristic because undesired states in particular can be misinterpreted for negative outcomes, such as damage or injury.\nParticipants\nThe participating organization under study was a large U.K. airline with an aircraft engineering subsidiary. The subsidiary provides base and line maintenance for Boeing and Airbus fleets, engine services, and material logistical support both for the company aircraft and for third-party organizations. Considering these characteristics, it is likely that findings from this research will transfer to other maintenance organizations.\nA company line maintainer with European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Part 66 license, category B1, and over 20 years of experience acted as an observer and provided expert advice throughout the development phase. The observed 12 participants were company line maintainers with current EASA Part 66 license (category type was not collected at this stage).\nProcedure overview\nThe MOSS development process ( Figure 1 ) involved an iterative process of testing and editing of the observation instrument, protocol, and TEM coding (discussed in the next sections). The continuous collection of observational data and subsequent revisions were discussed between the researcher, the observer, company line maintenance manager, and quality manager until consensus was achieved.\nDownload in PowerPoint\nFigure 1. Maintenance operations safety survey (MOSS) development process. LOSA = line operations safety audit; TEM = threat and error management.\nOverall, 12 test observations of line maintenance checks were conducted. We ensured that most of the LOSA operating characteristics (see Table 1 ) were in place before test data collection. Targets for enhancements were the only exception, as we did not expect the operator to act on the TEM results from the development phase. We had support from the union and management to conduct peer-to-peer observations. The test observations were selected purposely ( Yin, 2011 ) during day and night shifts and collected at two different line maintenance stations. Two observers, the researcher and an experienced maintainer, trained in TEM jointly conducted the test observations. At the end of each observation, the maintainer was asked if he or she felt uncomfortable or threatened during the observation and if this feeling led to a change of behavior. All observations were anonymous, nonpunitive, and conducted with prior consent from observed maintainers. To minimize information loss as a result of memory decay, both observers jointly reconstructed the observed events and wrote the narrative immediately after the completion of each observation ( Robson, 2002 ; Weick, 1968 ; Wilkinson, 2000 ).\nObservation instrument\nMOSS is based on structured observations requiring an observation instrument ( Robson, 2002 ). We consulted the LOSA observation forms published by ICAO (2002b) and by Klinect (2005) and made adaptations to suit this research. Specifically, we changed the demographic information and narrative breakdown by task stage. The initial draft MOSS form included demographic information about the observer, aircraft type, shift type, station, date, start and finish time of a check, and maintenance type (line, hangar, store, engine shop). Also, basic information about the observed maintainer was collected: license type, years of experience, and years in this position. The narrative was broken down into setup, procedure, and close-up as discussed previously.\nAs the collection of test observations progressed, we decided to remove the date from the demographic section to further protect the observed maintainer from identification. We inserted additional information regarding the task(s) observed, which was split into routine and nonroutine (unscheduled), as line checks often include both types. Also, the narrative procedure stage was separated accordingly. Following the completion of the 12 test observations, the MOSS observation form was finalized and ready for the deployment stage (Study 2). A final version of the deidentified MOSS observation form is presented in the appendix .\nDerivation of TEM codes\nThe code derivation process used principles from content analysis ( Krippendorff, 2004 ). With the TEM definitions in mind, the narratives were repeatedly reviewed to identify threats, errors, and undesired states. Separate categories were created for responses and outcomes to establish the TEM event chain. For example, in the narrative Example 1 ( Table 2 ), the duty manager approached the maintainer, asking to board. This event is clearly a threat, as the interruption has an impact on the maintainer’s performance and the situation must be managed to ensure safety. According to its origin, it is coded as “organizational threat–dispatch/flight operations–request to commence boarding.” The maintainer responded to the threat appropriately, so it did not lead to any errors, nor did it have any negative impact on the check. Therefore the threat was coded as inconsequential. The uncoded text provides an important context, which, on many occasions, reveals the links between TEM events.\nTable 2: Derivation of TEM Codes From Narratives\nTable 2: Derivation of TEM Codes From Narratives\nNote.

"""UCL""","""Iris Publication""","""http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/151599/\nAbstract\nOne interaction between environmental and safety goals in transport is found within the vehicle fleet where fuel economy and secondary safety performance of individual vehicles impose conflicting requirements on vehicle mass from an individual’s perspective. Fleet characteristics influence the relationship between the environmental and safety outcomes of the fleet; the topic of this paper. Cross-sectional analysis of mass within the British fleet is used to estimate the partial effects of mass on the fuel consumption and secondary safety performance of vehicles. The results confirmed that fuel consumption increases as mass increases and is different for different combinations of fuel and transmission types. Additionally, increasing vehicle mass generally decreases the risk of injury to the driver of a given vehicle in the event of a crash. However, this relationship depends on the characteristics of the vehicle fleet, and in particular, is affected by changes in mass distribution within the fleet. We confirm that there is generally a trade-off in vehicle design between fuel economy and secondary safety performance imposed by mass. Cross-comparison of makes and models by model-specific effects reveal cases where this trade-off exists in other aspects of design. Although it is shown that mass imposes a trade-off in vehicle design between safety and fuel use, this does not necessarily mean that it imposes a trade-off between safety and environmental goals in the vehicle fleet as a whole because the secondary safety performance of a vehicle depends on both its own mass and the mass of the other vehicles with which it collides.\nPublication data is maintained in RPS.

The construction of the Composite Safety Performance Index (CSPI) involves the following key steps: the selection of the most appropriate indicators to be aggregated and the method used to aggregate them.\nOver the last decade, various aggregation methods for estimating the CSPI have been suggested in the literature. However, recent studies indicates that most of these methods suffer from many deficiencies at both the theoretical and operational level; these include the correlation and compensability between indicators, as well as their high “degree of freedom” which enables one to readily manipulate them to produce desired outcomes.\nThe purpose of this study is to introduce an alternative aggregation method for the estimation of the CSPI, which is free from the aforementioned deficiencies. In contrast with the current aggregation methods, which generally use linear combinations of road safety indicators to estimate a CSPI, the approach advocated in this study is based on non-linear combinations of indicators and can be summarized into the following two main steps: the pairwise comparison of road safety indicators and the development of marginal and composite road safety performance functions. The introduced method has been successfully applied to identify and rank temporal and spatial hotspots for Northern Ireland, using road traffic collision data recorded in the UK STATs19 database. The obtained results highlight the promising features of the proposed approach including its stability and consistency, which enables significantly reduced deficiencies associated with the current aggregation methods. Progressively, the introduced method could evolve into an intelligent support system for road safety assessment.\nOriginal language\n""","5.1039033","""http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/ranking-spatial-and-temporal-hotspots-for-road-safety-interventions-using-a-nonlinear-aggregation-approach(ed487a45-05e0-4cf6-aae9-343b07517bcf).html""","[-5.934759,54.583863]"

Exposure to air pollution may adversely affect human health by triggering or exacerbating respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, certain cancers, and possibly diabetes, leading to premature mortality ( Beelen et al. 2014a ; Hoek et al. 2013 ; Raaschou-Nielsen et al. 2012 , 2013 ).\nDeclining rates of physical activity ( Brownson et al. 2005 ) have given rise to population-level health initiatives including promotion of active transport in cities, encouraging a shift from car use to cycling and walking ( de Nazelle et al. 2011 ). These initiatives are also highly relevant as a solution to other urban challenges such as traffic congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse-gas emission problems in major cities. One of the major challenges to active transport initiatives and other efforts to promote exercise is the trade-off between the health benefits of increased physical activity and potential harms due to amplified exposure to air pollution during outdoor physical activity in urban areas ( Rojas-Rueda et al. 2011 , 2012 , 2013 ; Woodcock et al. 2014 ). Increased respiratory uptake and deposition of air pollutants in the lung due to higher minute ventilation during physical exercise may amplify harmful effects of air pollution, even in young and healthy individuals ( Giles and Koehle 2014 ; Strak et al. 2010 ). In controlled, real-life exposure studies, reduced lung function has been reported in association with walking on a busy street in London ( McCreanor et al. 2007 ; Zhang et al. 2009 ), running near heavy traffic close to major highway ( Rundell et al. 2008 ), cycling during rush hour on a heavy-traffic route ( Strak et al. 2010 ), or hiking on high air pollution days ( Korrick et al. 1998 ). Similarly, exposure to air pollution and exercise in a controlled setting was reported to alter markers of vascular impairment, arterial stiffness, and vascular reactivity and to reduce exercise performance ( Cutrufello et al. 2012 ; Lundbäck et al. 2009 ; Rundell and Caviston 2008 ; Shah et al. 2008 ) and alter immune function ( Chimenti et al. 2009 ). These studies documented evidence of acute adverse health effects of short-duration exposures to high levels of air pollution during exercise, which seem to be transient and reversible after exercise, at least in young healthy individuals.\nOne study examined whether exercise modified associations of acute (same-day) exposure to air pollution with mortality in Hong Kong, and reported that regular exercise may reduce premature death attributable to air pollution in elderly subjects ( Wong et al. 2007 ). A cohort study in children reported that participating in sports was associated with development of asthma in children residing in areas with high ozone, but not in areas with low ozone levels ( McConnell et al. 2002 ). These studies implied that there is a potential interaction between physical activity and air pollution, yet no cohort study in adults has explored whether long-term exposure to air pollution modifies beneficial health effects of physical activity on mortality.\nIn a large prospective urban cohort, we studied whether reductions in mortality linked to regular outdoor leisure-time and transport-related physical activity in terms of doing sports, cycling, gardening, and walking ( Johnsen et al. 2013 ) were modified by long-term exposure to high levels of air pollution at residence.\nMaterials and Methods\nDesign and study population. This study was based on the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort, described in detail elsewhere ( Tjønneland et al. 2007 ). In brief, the cohort consists of 57,053 men (48%) and women (52%) born in Denmark, 50–64 years of age, living in Copenhagen or Aarhus, with no previous cancer diagnosis at the time of enrollment (1993–1997). The participants completed an extensive questionnaire on diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, education, occupation, physical activity, history of diseases and medication, and other health-related items, and provided blood samples, blood pressure, and height and weight measurements at enrollment. Relevant Danish ethical committees and data protection agencies approved the study, and written informed consent was provided by all participants.\nMortality definition. Each cohort member was followed up in the Danish Register of Causes of Death ( Helweg-Larsen 2011 ) until 31 December 2009, using a unique personal identification number. On the basis of the underlying cause of death, we defined total mortality as all mortality from natural causes [International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes A00–R99], cancer mortality (C00–C97), cardiovascular mortality (I00–I99), respiratory mortality (J00–J99), and diabetes mortality (E10–E14). We extracted the date of emigration or disappearance and the addresses of all cohort members from the Central Population Registry ( Pedersen 2011 ) using their personal identification numbers.\nPhysical activity. Physical activity was assessed by a self-administered, interviewer-checked questionnaire in which leisure time and transport-related (e.g., to and from work, shopping) physical activity was reported as hours per week spent on sports, cycling, gardening, walking, housework (cleaning, shopping), and “do-it-yourself” activities (e.g., house repair). Data were collected separately for winter and summer of the previous year, and the two values were averaged, so that being active implies at least half an hour spent on a specific activity per week. The physical activity questions have been validated in two studies that found high correlation between self-reported physical activity estimates with the accelerometer measurements of total metabolic equivalent in 182 subjects ( Cust et al. 2008 ) and with combined heart rate and movement sensing measurements in 1,941 subjects ( InterAct Consortium et al. 2012 ). We focused in this study on sports, cycling, and gardening, which were previously associated with lower mortality in the same cohort ( Johnsen et al. 2013 ), and additionally walking at least half an hour per week, which is relevant as an outdoor physical activity pertinent to exposure to air pollution. A previous analysis of data from the cohort indicated that accounting for the amount of physical activity did not substantially alter associations with mortality when activity was dichotomized as any participation versus none ( Johnsen et al. 2013 ). Therefore, our main analyses focused on the estimated effect of participation (yes/no) in sports, cycling, gardening, and walking on mortality, whereas associations with the amount of cycling (categorized as does not cycle, 0.5–4 hr/week, or > 4 hr/week) were estimated in sensitivity analyses.\nAir pollution exposure. The outdoor concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was calculated at the residential addresses of each cohort member with the Danish AirGIS dispersion modeling system ( http://www.dmu.dk/en/air/models/airgis/ ). AirGIS is based on a geographical information system (GIS) and provides estimates of traffic-related air pollution with high temporal (1-year averages) and spatial (address-level) resolution. AirGIS is a validated model: High correlation was found between AirGIS estimated and measured NO2 values ( Raaschou-Nielsen et al. 2000 ), which has been used in a number of studies ( Andersen et al. 2012b , 2012c ; Raaschou-Nielsen et al. 2011 , 2012 , 2013 ) and is described in more detail in the Supplemental Material, “AirGIS Human Exposure Modelling System.” We used the mean of annual concentrations of NO2 at residential addresses of each cohort participant since 1971 until the end of follow-up as a proxy of average exposure to traffic-related air pollution during exercise. We defined an indicator variable of high versus moderate/low NO2 exposure separated by the 75th percentile of exposure range in the cohort (≥ vs. < 19.0 μg/m3).\nStatistical methods. We used Cox proportional hazards regression with age as the underlying time scale to simultaneously estimate associations between mortality and participation in sports, cycling, gardening, and walking, with separate models used to estimate associations of the four activities with total, cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory, and diabetes mortality, respectively. The follow-up started on the date of enrollment into the cohort (1993–1997) until the date of death, emigration, or 31 December 2009, whichever came first. We fit a crude model adjusted for age (underlying time scale), each of the four domains of physical activity, NO2, sex, and year of enrollment into cohort. In addition we fit a fully adjusted model that also included occupational physical activity (sedentary work, standing work, manual work, heavy manual work, or no occupation), smoking status (never, previous, current), lifetime smoking intensity (spline), smoking duration (years), environmental tobacco smoke (indicator of exposure to smoke in the home and/or at work for at least 4 hr/day), alcohol intake (indicator and spline for intensity, grams/day), educational level (< 8, 8–10, or > 10 years of education), fruit and vegetable intake (grams/day), fat intake (grams/day), occupational risk (indicator of a year or longer in an occupation with potential exposure to smoke, particles, fumes or chemicals: mining, rubber industry, tannery, chemical industry, wood-processing industry, metal processing, foundry, steel-rolling mill, shipyard, glass industry, graphics industry, building industry, truck, bus, or taxi driver, manufacture of asbestos or asbestos cement, asbestos insulation, cement article industry, china and pottery industry, painter, welder, hairdresser, auto mechanic), and mean income in the municipality of residence at enrollment (spline), We checked the proportional hazards assumption for all categorical variables by testing for a non-zero slope in a generalized linear regression of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals on functions of time [estat phtest command in Stata (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA)]. We detected violation of proportional hazards assumption by marital status (single, married, divorced, widow/widower) and therefore stratified the model by this variable. Significance level < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant result in all analyses. An additional model was fit in which potentially mediating variables [body mass index (BMI; continuous, kilograms per meter squared), self-reported diagnosis or medication for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia] were added to the full model. Effect modification of associations between the four physical activities (yes/no) and mortality from different causes by exposure to NO2 (moderate/high or low) was evaluated by introducing an interaction term into the model, and tested using likelihood ratio tests. Additionally, for cycling, we tested whether there was an interaction between intensity of cycling (> 4 hr/week, 0.5–4 hr/week, does not cycle) and NO2 levels, to examine whether there is a dose–response relationship with different levels of NO2 [very high, ≥ 23.9 μg/m3 (90th percentile of exposure range); moderate, 15.1–23.9 μg/m3; low, < 15.1 μg/m3 (50th percentile of exposure range)]. We also conducted sensitivity analyses using 1-year mean of NO2 at the residential address at enrollment (1993–1997, corresponding to the time period for the self-reported physical activity data) as an alternative proxy of exposure to air pollution. Finally, we conducted two sensitivity analyses on total and respiratory mortality: a) with high exposure to air pollution defined as NO2 levels above the 90th percentile (23.9 μg/m3) of exposure range; and b) in a cohort subset consisting of 13,948 subjects living in inner Copenhagen (municipalities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg)—the most urban part of the cohort, with the highest levels of cycling and air pollution (75th percentile of NO2 distribution = 24 μg/m3). Results are presented as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), estimated with stcox in Stata 11.2.\nResults\nOf 57,053 cohort members, 571 were excluded due to cancer diagnosis before baseline, 2 due to uncertain date of cancer diagnosis, 960 for whom an address history was not available for at least 80% of the time between 1971 and recruitment date in the Central Population Registry or their address at baseline could not be geocoded, 948 due to missing air pollution exposure (due to missing traffic counts or other air pollution model input data), and 2,511 due to missing information for a potential confounder or effect modifier, leaving 52,061 cohort members for the study. Excluded subjects did not differ significantly from the rest of the cohort with respect to age, physical activity levels, and education (results not shown).\nStudy participants were followed for a mean of 13 years, resulting in 677,760 person-years, during which 5,534 (10.6%) died. Of these, 2,864 (50.6%) died from cancer, 1,285 (23.2%) from cardiovascular disease, 354 (6.4%) from respiratory disease, and 122 (2.2%) from diabetes as the underlying cause of death.\nMean age at recruitment was 56.6 years ( Table 1 ). Most of the study subjects participated in physical activity: 54.3% participated in sports, 68.0% cycled, 73.5% gardened, and 93.0% walked. Participation in all physical activities was lower among those who died during follow-up than in the entire cohort ( Table 1 ), with the lowest participation among those who died from respiratory disease and diabetes ( Table 2 ). The mean concentration of NO2 at residence was 16.9 ± 5.2 μg/m3 for the cohort and 17.9 ± 5.7 μg/m3 for the subjects who died during follow-up ( Table 1 ).\nTable 1 – Characteristics of 52,061 participants in the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nStatistically significant inverse associations were observed between participation in sports (vs. non participation) and all mortality ( Table 3 ), with fully adjusted HRs of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.82) for total mortality, 0.82 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.89), 0.78 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.88), 0.60 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.77), and 0.34 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.55) for cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory, and diabetes mortality, respectively. Statistically significant inverse associations, somewhat weaker than those for participation in sports, were estimated for cycling (vs. not cycling) and gardening (vs. not gardening) with all but cancer mortality: 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.88) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.89) for total mortality, 0.78 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.88) and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.93) for cardiovascular mortality, 0.62 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.77) and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.79) for respiratory mortality, and 0.61 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.89) and 0.42 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.62) for diabetes mortality, respectively. Walking (vs. not walking) was statistically significantly inversely associated with respiratory mortality only (HR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.97). All estimates were robust (remained unchanged or were only slightly attenuated) to additional adjustment for BMI, blood pressure, and hypercholesterolemia (data not shown).\nTable 3 – Association [HR (95% CI)] of total and cause-specific mortality with participation (yes/no) in physical activities among 52,061 participants in the Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nThere was no statistically significant effect modification of inverse associations between any of the four physical activities and mortality by NO2, except for gardening (p = 0.02), and borderline significant associations for cycling (p-value for interaction 0.09) on respiratory mortality ( Table 3 ). The inverse associations of cycling and gardening with respiratory mortality were stronger among subjects with moderate/low NO2 exposure (HR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.72 and HR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.73, respectively) than among those with high NO2 exposure (HR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.11 and HR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.55, 1.18, respectively). Comparable and slightly attenuated effect estimates were observed for all physical activities with a 1-year mean level of NO2 at the cohort baseline (data not shown). There was no significant interaction between cycling intensity and NO2 when considering the dose–response relationship between increasing levels of cycling intensity and NO2 levels, categorized as low, moderate, or high (see Supplemental Material, Table S1). Furthermore, sensitivity analyses showed no effect modification of associations between total and respiratory mortality with any physical activity when exposure to NO2 was dichotomized at the 90th percentile (23.9 μg/m3) (see Supplemental Material, Table S2), or in the subset of cohort living in inner Copenhagen (see Supplemental Material, Table S3).\nDiscussion\nEstimates suggesting that leisure-time participation in sports, cycling, and gardening was associated with lower mortality were not significantly modified by exposure to NO2 in an urban setting, for total, cancer, cardiovascular, and diabetes mortality. Estimated benefits of cycling and gardening on respiratory mortality were moderately attenuated among those with high levels of NO2 exposure compared with moderate or low exposure.\nOur finding of significant reductions in total natural and cause-specific mortality related to physical activity confirm existing evidence ( Samitz et al. 2011 ; Woodcock et al. 2011 ) including Danish data ( Johnsen et al. 2013 ; Schnohr et al. 2006 ). Estimated benefits of cycling, including cycling to and from work and shopping, were weaker than estimated effects of participating in sports, but were significant, and comparable to the limited evidence. Benefits of cycling estimated in the present analysis were slightly weaker than those earlier reported for cycling to work on all-cause mortality in another cohort in Denmark (relative risk = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.91) ( Andersen et al. 2000 ) and comparable to cycling to work in Chinese women on overall mortality [HR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.61, 1.01 and HR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.40, 1.07, for 0.1–3.4 and ≥ 3.5 MET (metabolic equivalent)-hr/day, respectively, compared with no cycling] ( Matthews et al. 2007 ). Estimated inverse effects of gardening on mortality were noteworthy, because they are similar in magnitude to those of cycling, whereas weak inverse associations were detected between walking and respiratory mortality only.\nAdverse effects of chronic exposure to air pollution on total natural and cardiovascular mortality are well supported ( Hoek et al. 2013 ), and positive associations were also evident in this Danish cohort, where air pollution levels are relatively low ( Beelen et al. 2014a , 2014b ; Raaschou-Nielsen et al. 2012 , 2013 ). Long-term exposure to air pollution was also associated with diabetes mortality in this cohort ( Raaschou-Nielsen et al. 2013 ), but not with respiratory mortality, in agreement with the recent meta-analyses of 16 European cohorts, including a subset of the cohort in the present analyses ( Dimakopoulou et al. 2014 ). On the other hand, associations of air pollution with incidence of chronic respiratory disease—asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)—have been also found in this cohort ( Andersen et al. 2011 , 2012a ).\nOur results—that long-term benefits of physical activity on all major types of mortality were not moderated by exposure to high levels of NO2—are novel. This may imply that acute stress and damage to the cardiovascular system induced by short-term exposure to air pollution during exercise, in terms of vascular impairment, arterial stiffness, and reduced blood flow, as shown in earlier studies ( Lundbäck et al. 2009 ; Rundell and Caviston 2008 ; Shah et al. 2008 ), seem to be transient and reversible and do not abate long-term benefits of physical activity on mortality. Our results may furthermore be explained by the short duration of the physical activities, with mean of 2–3 hr/week for most activities ( Table 1 ); this implies that extra inhaled dose of air pollution during physical activity, which is a function of increased inhalation and duration, is only a small fraction of total inhaled dose of air pollution ( Rojas-Rueda et al. 2011 ), and is therefore not sufficient to increase the risk of premature mortality. Our results are furthermore in line with a study finding significantly lower levels of physical activity on days with poor air quality among respiratory disease patients, but not in cardiovascular patients, who do not seem immediately enough bothered by air pollution to change their outdoor physical activity habits ( Balluz et al. 2008 ; Wells et al. 2012 ). Our study thus may imply that effects of long-term exposure to NO2 and physical activity on overall and cardiovascular mortality are independent of each other, with benefits of outdoor physical activity not being reduced by exposure to NO2.\nInverse associations of cycling and gardening with respiratory mortality were closer to the null among subjects with high NO2 exposure (0.77; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.11 and 0.81; 95% CI: 0.55, 1.18, respectively) than among those with moderate/low NO2 (0.55; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.72 and 0.55; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.73, respectively). Only one similar study exists in a cohort of children, which, consistent with our findings, showed asthma development only in children living in areas with high ozone concentrations, and not in those living in areas with low ozone ( McConnell et al. 2002 ). It is plausible that amplification of lung damage due to greater inhaled doses of air pollution through physical activity in urban areas with high air pollution may moderate the benefits of physical activity, which improves some of the same physiological mechanisms. Earlier studies have shown that hikers with a history of asthma had significantly greater air pollution–related acute reductions in pulmonary functions than did asthma-free hikers ( Korrick et al. 1998 ), and that subjects with moderate asthma had greater acute lung function reductions after walking on a busy street in London than did those with mild asthma ( McCreanor et al. 2007 ; Zhang et al. 2009 ). However, reduced physical activity was observed on days with poor air quality among respiratory disease patients ( Balluz et al. 2008 ; Wells et al. 2012 ), but not among cardiovascular disease patients, as noted earlier. This implies an alternative explanation to our findings that reduced benefit from physical activity in subjects residing in areas with high air pollution may be attributable to abstaining from physical activity on days with high air pollution, and not from enhanced negative effects of greater exposure to air pollution during physical activity. Our findings were weakened by the fact that there was no dose–response relationship in reductions of respiratory mortality related to cycling by number of hours spent cycling and by increasing levels of air pollution (see Supplemental Material, Table S1). Although numbers are small in the interaction analyses, the lack of effect of duration of cycling may imply that the cyclists themselves differ from the noncyclists, and that in general, the effects of air pollution are minimal in healthy people. Finally, significant interactions of cycling and gardening with air pollution observed for respiratory mortality ( Table 3 ) could not be reproduced when considering levels of NO2 > 24.9 μg/m3 (the 90th percentile) as high exposure, or when considering the subset of subjects living in inner Copenhagen, where levels of air pollution and number of people cycling are at the highest in Denmark (see Supplemental Material, Tables S2 and S3). However, these analyses need to be interpreted with caution because in both sensitivity analyses, exposure levels were also increased in the “low” exposure category, possibly obscuring differences in associations between the lower and higher levels of exposure.\nIn summary, our findings suggest that outdoor physical activity in areas with high air pollution may moderate, but not reverse, the benefits of physical activity on respiratory mortality: Adverse effects of the additional pollutants inhaled over time do not outweigh the benefits of physical activity. Our results, however, need to be reproduced, because of both the small number of people dying from respiratory causes and the sensitivity of these results to the definition of NO2 and subcohort. Furthermore, because of the relatively small number of people dying from respiratory causes (6% in this cohort), and assuming that our results are true, reductions in health benefits related to physical activity in areas with high air pollution are rather marginal.\nStrengths of our study include a large prospective cohort, with well-defined and validated information on physical activity and air pollution exposure, both of which have been linked to mortality ( Johnsen et al. 2013 ; Raaschou-Nielsen et al. 2012 , 2013 ). We furthermore benefited from the state-of-the art information on individual exposure to NO2 with high spatial (address-specific) and temporal (annual mean) resolution, assessed over 35 years. Another strength of this cohort is the very high prevalence of cycling (68%), both leisure and utilitarian (e.g., to work, shopping); this provided the data for evaluation of an interaction of air pollution with this type of physical activity, in contrast to existing studies on cycling to work ( Andersen et al. 2000 ; Matthews et al. 2007 ; Rojas-Rueda et al. 2011 , 2012 ). Furthermore, this is the first cohort study to evaluate individual-level benefits of physical activity in an urban cohort while also considering individual exposure to air pollution. A study of short-term effects of air pollution on mortality in Hong Kong, which has several-fold higher levels of air pollution than in Copenhagen, found that those who exercised regularly had reduced susceptibility to acute effects of air pollution and lower mortality than those who did not exercise ( Wong et al. 2007 ). Our study provides a novel approach in contrast to existing health impact assessment studies. Our study estimated benefits versus risks of increased physical activity, typically by evaluating active travel policies targeted to shift commuters from car use to cycling, on a population level, based on derivation of risk estimates from different studies and hypothetical scenarios ( Andersen et al. 2000 ; de Hartog et al. 2010 ; Rojas-Rueda et al. 2011 , 2012 , 2013 ).\nA weakness of our study is the use of NO2 levels at residence as a proxy of average air pollution levels encountered during physical activity. This assumption works well for gardening, which typically occurs at the residence (the exact location of air pollution modeling) but less well for cycling and walking. Given that this cohort consists of older subjects 50–65 years of age at baseline, many of whom retired before study recruitment or during study follow-up, it is reasonable to assume that most of their time walking and cycling had taken place in close proximity to their residence, which may be well represented by air pollution levels at residence. The higher exposure misclassification is expected for cycling than for gardening. Cycling levels were the same for subjects residing in areas with low/moderate and high air pollution levels, 68%. Gardening was more common in subjects living in areas with low/moderate air pollution (79%) than in those living in areas with high air pollution (58%), because rates of house ownership are higher in the suburbs than in the inner city, where pollution is highest. Furthermore, we did not have information on cycling, walking, and exercising habits of cohort participants, and possible behavioral adjustment by those living in areas of high air pollution levels to avoid the most polluted areas, which may bias results. Similarly, participating in sports is a poor proxy of outdoor activity because we do not have information on the type of sports activity or whether it took place outdoors (running), or indoors (e.g., gym, badminton, swimming). Thus, lack of findings of interaction with air pollution and participation in sports may be attributable to exposure misclassification. Many cohort members retired during the study follow-up, implying the possibility of misclassification of exposure over time, if retirement led to considerable changes in cycling after enrollment. Most biking trips (over 65%) in Denmark are undertaken for leisure activities, shopping, and doing errands, with a minority for transport to and back from work ( Danish Technical University 2013 ). Cycling decreases with age in Denmark, but only marginally, by about 10–15% from 50–59 to 60–69 years, due to retirement/decrease in share of cycling trips to work ( Vithen 2013 ).\nAnother weakness is a lack of data on particulate matter (PM), which was available for only half of the cohort participants living in Copenhagen ( Beelen et al. 2014a ) and only for 2010, and was therefore not used here. However, NO2 and nitrogen oxides were found to correlate strongly with PM in Denmark, with Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.70 for PM10 (PM with diameter ≤ 10 μm) and 0.93 for ultrafine fraction of PM ( Hertel et al. 2001 ; Ketzel et al. 2003 ), implying that similar results for PM would be expected. Furthermore, we have shown earlier that PM10 originates largely from long-range transport in Denmark, resulting in smaller spatial variation than ultrafine PM and NO2 ( Andersen et al. 2007 ), which originate mainly from traffic. Traffic is the main focus of this study, reflecting air pollution exposures during exercise or commute. Still, NO2 serves as a proxy for all traffic-related pollutants, including elemental carbon, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, ultrafine PM, noise, and possibly road dust.\nAnother weakness is that DCH cohort participants are likely healthier than the general Danish population, because they are better educated and had higher income than nonparticipants ( Tjønneland et al. 2007 ). Finally, air pollution levels are relatively low in Copenhagen and Aarhus, and these findings need to be reproduced in sites with higher air pollution levels.\nOur results are in agreement with a growing number of health impact assessment studies that evaluate the net effects of an increase in cycling at the population level, typically as a shift from car use, and conclude that health benefits due to increased physical activity levels generally outweigh the risks related to increase inhaled air pollution doses during cycling ( de Hartog et al. 2010 ; Rojas-Rueda et al. 2011 , 2012 ; Woodcock et al. 2014 ).\nConclusions\nPhysical activity plays a key role in improving the physiologic mechanisms and health outcomes that exposure to air pollution may exacerbate. This presents a challenge in understanding and balancing the beneficial effects of physical activity in the urban environment with the detrimental effects of air pollution on human health. Our findings suggest that beneficial effects of physical activity on mortality in an urban area with relatively low levels of air pollution are not moderated in subjects residing in areas with the highest levels of air pollution. Estimated benefits of cycling and gardening on respiratory mortality were marginally reduced, but not annulled, for those living in areas with high NO2 levels, but these novel results need confirmation. Overall, the long-term benefits of physical activity in terms of reduced mortality outweigh the risk associated with enhanced exposure to air pollution during physical activity.\nReferences\nAndersen LB, Schnohr P, Schroll M, Hein HO. 2000.

During regenerative decelerations, the nonlinear powertrain backlash would excite driveline oscillations, deteriorating vehicle drivability and blended brake performance. Therefore, backlash compensation is worthwhile researching for an advanced powertrain control of electrified vehicles during regenerative deceleration.In this study, a nonlinear powertrain of an electric passenger car equipped with a central motor is modeled using hybrid system approach. The effect of powertrain backlash gap on vehicle drivability during regenerative deceleration is analyzed. To further improve an electric vehicle's drivability and blended braking performance, an active control algorithm with a hierarchical architecture is studied for powertrain backlash compensation. Since the backlash in driveline is unable to be measured by a sensor, a high-level hybrid observer for backlash identification is designed at first. Then, based on the observation of the backlash traverse, a low-level switching-based active controller for powertrain backlash compensation is synthesized.The proposed control algorithm is simulated and compared with a non-active baseline strategy under regeneration deceleration. The simulation results show that the nonlinear powertrain backlash is well compensated by the developed active control algorithm, and the vehicle drivability and blended braking performance are also significantly enhanced.\nAlso in:\n""","10.282589","""http://papers.sae.org/2015-01-1225/""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

Each agent has a non-increasing marginal valuation function for the resource, and an upper limit on the number of units that can be allocated in any period. We propose two versions on a truthful allocation mechanism. Each modifies the decisions of a greedy online assignment algorithm by sometimes cancelling an allocation of resources. One version makes this modification immediately upon an allocation decision while a second waits until the point at which an agent departs the market. Adopting a prior-free framework, we show that the second approach has better worst-case allocative efficiency and is more scalable. On the other hand, the first approach (with immediate cancellation) may be easier in practice because it does not need to reclaim units previously allocated. We consider an application to recharging plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Using data from a real-world trial of PHEVs in the UK, we demonstrate higher system performance than a fixed price system, performance comparable with a standard, but non-truthful scheduling heuristic, and the ability to support 50% more vehicles at the same fuel cost than a simple randomized policy.\n""","7.4132767","""http://jair.org/papers/paper4064.html""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

Inflammation has been proposed as a possible mechanism, and this possibility is supported by experimental models ( Donaldson et al. 2003 ; Niwa et al. 2008 ; Vogel et al. 2005 ) and population studies ( Rückerl et al. 2006 , 2007 ; Schwartz 2001 ). A key player in modulating the inflammatory response is interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic cytokine shown to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality ( Rattazzi et al. 2003 ).\nLevels of IL-6 in plasma may be affected by specific genetic variations of both the gene encoding IL-6 (IL6; GenBank accession number M18403) ( Bennermo et al. 2004 ; Burzotta et al. 2001 ) and genes encoding the fibrinogen protein [α-chain (FGA), β-chain (FGB), and γ-chain (FGG); GenBank accession numbers NM_000508, NM_005141, and NM_021870, respectively] ( Mannila et al. 2007 ; National Center for Biotechnology Information 2009 ). Because IL-6 principally stimulates fibrinogen production ( Dalmon et al. 1993 ), a possible explanation for increased IL-6 levels in association with certain fibrinogen gene polymorphisms is a positive feedback mechanism where fibrinogen products (fibrin) increase IL-6 production in monocytes and macrophages ( Ritchie et al. 1982 ; Robson et al. 1994 ; Szaba and Smiley 2002 ).\nSeveral studies have shown expression of the IL6 gene to be induced by air pollution ( Quay et al. 1998 ; Vogel et al. 2005 ; Watterson et al. 2007 ), but no studies have examined induction of fibrinogen genes or examined variants of the IL6 gene and how they may possibly lead to differences in individual susceptibility to air pollution. In previous analyses from this study population, genetic polymorphisms of fibrinogen have been associated with increased fibrinogen plasma levels ( Jacquemin et al. 2008 ) and modified the fibrinogen response to ambient particulate matter (PM) ( Peters et al. 2009 ). In light of a positive feedback mechanism of fibrinogen levels on IL-6 levels, polymorphisms of fibrinogen may potentially affect IL-6 levels differently through differences in transcription rate of fibrinogen. Indeed, combinations of polymorphisms in the IL6 and fibrinogen genes may interact to further increase IL-6 levels.\nMyocardial infarction (MI) survivors have a compromised long-term prognosis, making relative risk reduction particularly advantageous. We hypothesized that the moderate effect of air pollution seen on inflammatory markers in previous studies is stronger in MI survivors with specific variants of inflammatory genes such as IL6 and the fibrinogen genes. We aimed to assess the influence of polymorphisms of the IL6, FGA, and FGB genes on the IL-6 response to air pollution and to explore the influence of gene–gene interactions on this effect.\nWe present here results of a meta-analysis of six independent studies whose data were collected by a common protocol and that were designed to look at gene–air pollution interactions ( Peters et al. 2007 )\nMaterials and Methods\nPatients. IL-6 concentrations were assessed in the AIRGENE study, a multicenter longitudinal study of MI survivors from six European cities: Athens, Greece; Augsburg, Germany; Barcelona, Spain; Helsinki, Finland; Rome, Italy; Stockholm, Sweden ( Peters et al. 2007 ). Subjects between 35 and 80 years of age who had experienced an MI between 4 months and 6 years before start of the study were recruited through population-based MI registries (KORA MI Registry Augsburg, and registries in Barcelona and Stockholm) or from administrative databases of hospital admissions (Athens, Helsinki, and Rome). Patients with MI or interventional procedures < 3 months before the beginning of the study or with chronic recurring inflammatory diseases such as Crohn’s disease were excluded. MI was defined based on the European Society of Cardiology/American College of Cardiology Committee criteria ( Anonymous 2000 ). Study protocols were approved by local ethics committees, and written consent was obtained from all patients before inclusion in the study.\nPatients were invited to participate in six to eight clinical visits between May 2003 and July 2004. The visits were scheduled every 4–6 weeks, on the same weekday and at the same time of the day to minimize the impact of weekly and circadian variation in biological processes and air pollution levels. The average number of visits per patient was 5.8, resulting in 5,813 plasma samples. The subjects recruited were predominantly middle-age men who had survived one MI for > 2 years on average ( Table 1 ).\nTable 1 – Data on patient characteristics, IL-6 measurements, and air pollution concentrations in the AIRGENE study.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nField study. The fieldwork was based on standard operating procedures developed by the AIRGENE study group. At a baseline clinical visit, a single blood sample for DNA analysis was collected and stored at − 80°C until shipment on dry ice for DNA isolation at the laboratory at the Helmholtz Zentrum München—German Research Center for Environmental Health in Neuherberg, Germany. Patients were also characterized at baseline with respect to comorbidities, smoking history, environmental tobacco exposures, socioeconomic status, regular exercise, and alcohol and medication intake. Measurements of blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were performed.\nAt each repeated clinical visit, including baseline, a short questionnaire was administered regarding smoking behavior, time of last meal, and a 7-day recall of medication intake. In addition, a blood sample was collected for IL-6 assessment according to previously described procedures ( Peters et al. 2007 ). For quality assurance purposes, 102 randomly selected IL-6 duplicate samples from all centers except Athens were analyzed, showing an average coefficient of variation of 13.8% (from 3.2% in Augsburg to 23.4% in Stockholm).\nAir pollution. Data on hourly means of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), PM with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm (PM10) or ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5), particle number concentration (PNC), air temperature, and relative humidity were collected for each city ( Rückerl et al. 2007 ) and aggregated to 6- and 24-hr running means on the basis of standard procedures ( Katsouyanni et al. 1995 ). Inhalable (PM10) and thoracic (PM2.5) particles were strongly correlated (overall r across cities for consecutive 24-hr means = 0.81), and local combustion-related pollutants were strongly correlated (CO and NO2, overall r = 0.68; and both also to PNC, overall r = 0.67 and 0.74, respectively). We also saw this overall pattern in the single cities, with the exception of Athens and Stockholm, which showed less correlation between CO and PNC.\nGenotyping. We extracted DNA from EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid)–anticoagulated blood using a salting out procedure. We selected 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for IL6 and 21 SNPs for FGA, FGB, and FGG and genotyped them as described previously ( Peters et al. 2007 ). Genotyping success rates ranged between 97.9% for IL6 rs2069832 and 99.8% for FGB rs1800790.\nSNP selection. We selected IL6 SNPs that showed an association with IL-6 levels in our sample (p-value < 0.05) and were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for gene–environment analyses (Ljungman et al. 2008). Five SNPs met this criterion, but IL6 rs2069832 and rs1800795 were in very high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2 = 0.99), as were rs1554606 and rs2069845 (r2 = 0.99). Therefore, one of each pair (rs2069832 and rs1554606) was chosen for further gene–environment interaction analyses. IL6 rs2069840 was, however, in weak LD (r2 = 0.31 to 0.35) with the other selected SNPs and might have independent effects. Associations have been seen between IL-6 levels and fibrinogen levels ( Mannila et al. 2004 ), and previous analyses in our study population ( Jacquemin et al. 2008 ) have shown evidence of modification of the effect of fibrinogen polymorphisms on fibrinogen levels by levels of IL-6. Consequently, we selected one SNP each from the genes coding the α-chain (FGA, rs2070011) and β-chain (FGB, rs1800790) of fibrinogen, which were both associated with fibrinogen levels in the previous study ( Jacquemin et al. 2008 ), based on these results.\nOf the 1003 study participants, we restricted all further analyses to 955 (95%) for whom complete information on the five SNPs was available.\nStatistical analysis. We estimated the effect of the SNPs on IL-6 using linear mixed effects models with random subject-specific intercepts, adjusting linearly for the variables age, BMI, pack-years of cigarette smoking, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, alcohol intake, and logarithm of NT-proBNP and for the categorical variables city, HbA1c, number of earlier MIs, history of heart failure or diabetes, and symptoms of phlegm. SNP genotypes were coded as an ordinal variable by the number of copies of the minor allele (0, 1, 2; denoted 1 1, 1 2, and 2 2 in tables and figures) as described in Ljungman et al. (2008).\nFor detailed information on model selection procedures, see Rückerl et al. (2007) . We estimated the overall effects of air pollutants on IL-6 in city-specific additive mixed models [see Supplemental Material, Table 1 (doi: 10.1289/ehp.0800370.S1 via http://dx.doi.org/)], adjusting for the above-described patient characteristics, time trend, and the weather parameters air temperature and relative humidity to accommodate the different characteristics and meteorologic conditions across Europe, as previously reported ( Rückerl et al. 2007 ). We tested the robustness of the model to exclusion of all time-invariant variables in sensitivity analyses.\nGene–environment interactions were estimated for each SNP by including in these models the main effect of the SNP (additive genetic model), the main effect of the air pollution effect, and the interaction term between air pollution and SNP. We determined the a priori exposure window for all gene–environment interaction analyses to be the average exposure during the 24 hr immediately preceding blood withdrawal based on results from previous analyses ( Rückerl et al. 2007 ) and the short half-life of IL-6. Secondary analyses were performed for other time windows of exposure as well as for gene–gene combinations of polymorphisms showing effect modification. We explored consistency of patterns of association in city-specific analyses. In assessing the contributions of the different exposure windows to the interaction effect, we also performed analyses for the subjects carrying at least one risk allele using distributed lags, thus allowing for independence of effects for each time window of exposure in a common model.\nEffect estimates by genotypes are presented together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Because the study of gene–environment interactions was of an exploratory nature, we did not attempt to correct for multiple comparisons for these analyses. Estimates are presented for an increase of the pollutants by a one interquartile increase in pollutant exposure range and expressed as a relative change of the overall geometric mean in IL-6. We tested the assumption of an additive genetic effect by using an indicator variable for the heterozygote genotype in the model. For overall results, we pooled city-specific estimates using meta-analysis methodology ( van Houwelingen et al. 2002 ). Heterogeneity of effect estimates was assessed with a chi-square test with 5 degrees of freedom. If the p-value was < 0.1, random effect models were applied for combining effect estimates.\nResults\nMean IL-6 ranged from 2.5 pg/mL in Augsburg to 3.5 pg/mL in Barcelona ( Table 1 ). The consecutive 24-hr mean levels of CO ranged from 0.29 mg/m3 in Stockholm to 1.48 mg/m3 in Athens. The within-interquartile difference ranged from 0.08 in Helsinki to 0.73 in Athens.\nLess than 5% of the subjects were homozygotes for the minor allele of FGB rs1800790, whereas 9–19% of subjects were homozygotes for minor allele of the IL6 and FGA polymorphisms ( Table 2 ). Genotype frequencies differed among the cities for all SNPs (chi-square test, p < 0.03), displaying a north–south gradient, with the minor alleles of IL6 rs2069832 and IL6 rs2069845 having higher frequencies in the northern cities and the minor alleles of IL6 rs2069840 having higher frequencies in the southern cities. The fibrinogen SNPs did not show such a pattern (data not shown).\nTable 2 – SNPs and SNP–IL-6 association: characteristics of the analyzed SNPs of IL6, FGB, and FGA and their association with plasma IL-6 concentrations.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nOverall effect of genotype on IL-6 levels.  Table 2 shows the associations of SNPs with an increased plasma level of IL-6 in this data set. The minor alleles of IL6 rs2069832 and IL6 rs2069845 and the major allele of IL6 rs2069840 were significantly associated with an increased plasma level (at p < 0.05) (Ljungman et al. 2008). The minor allele of FGA rs2070011 showed nonsignificant association to increased plasma levels of IL-6, whereas FGB rs1800790 polymorphism showed no clear association to plasma IL-6. We found no evidence of deviation from the additive model for these SNPs (p-value for heterozygote indicator variable > 0.05).\nOverall effects of air pollution on IL-6 levels. Elevated concentrations of CO averaged during the 0–24 hr preceding blood sampling were not significantly associated with increased plasma IL-6 levels ( Table 3 ), but elevated concentrations during 6–11 hr intervals preceding sampling were associated (2.2% change of overall mean IL-6; 95% CI, 0.3–4.2%). For other pollutants, NO2 levels averaged over the 0–24 hr preceding blood sampling showed associations with an increase in plasma IL-6 ( Table 3 ), and PNC levels showed significant associations for both 6–11 hr and 12–17 hr exposure windows preceding sampling [1.8% change (95% CI, 0.2–3.5%) and 2.6% change (95% CI, 0.8–4.5%), respectively].\nTable 3 – Effect of 24-hr interquartile range increase in air pollution on IL-6 plasma levels.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nGenotype modification of IL-6 response (24-hr exposure windows). Subjects with the homozygous major allele genotypes for all three IL6 polymorphisms showed larger IL-6 responses to increased CO, but only for for IL6 rs2069832 was a similar genetic inter-action seen with increased NO2 ( Table 4 ).\nTable 4 – SNP–environment interactions: association between 24-hr average of CO or NO2 and plasma IL-6 levels by genotype for the analyzed polymorphisms in the genes IL6, FGA, and FGB.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nSubjects with the homozygote minor allele genotype of FGB rs1800790 showed both a larger and clearer effect modification for the IL-6 response to increased CO compared with the IL6 SNPs. The overall effect of a 0.8% increase in IL-6 per 0.34 mg/m3 increase of CO in the preceding 0–24 hr seemed to be confined to individuals carrying the minor allele of FGB rs1800790. In the 4% of the study sample that were homozygous with this allele, the corresponding CO effect on IL-6 was a 4.5% increase. We saw similar magnitudes of effect modification for NO2, but the effect modification pattern was not statistically significant. The FGA SNP did not modify the response to air pollution. These results were robust to sensitivity analysis excluding all time-invariant variables from the final model and only maintaining time trend and meteorology (data not shown).\nFor PM pollutants, we found a similar pattern of effect modification of FGB rs1800790 for increased levels of PM2.5 and PM10 during the preceding 0–24 hr, but with less precision of effect for PM10 ( Figure 1 ). For ultrafine particles measured by PNC and for IL6 rs2069832, the pattern was less clear.\nFigure 1 – Modification by IL6 rs2069832 (A) and FGB rs1800790 (B) genotypes of IL-6 response to increased 24-hr average ambient CO, NO2, ultrafine PM (PNC), and PM2.5 immediately preceding blood withdrawal (1, major allele; 2, minor allele).

Subjects with ≥ three high-risk alleles from both SNPs (154 subjects) had the largest IL-6 response.\nFigure 2 – (A) Construction of gene–gene interaction variable based on relative change in plasma IL-6 in univariate gene–environment interaction analysis of polymorphisms IL6 rs2069832 and FGB rs1800790.

We found greatest effect modification for FGB rs1800790 for increased CO during the 6–11 hr preceding sampling. The overall effect of a 2.2% increase in IL-6 per 0.64 mg/m3 increase of CO in this time window seemed again to be confined to individuals carrying the minor allele of FGB rs1800790, with a 10% (95% CI, 4.6–16%) increase in homozygotes (4% of study sample). In homozygotes for the major allele of IL6 rs2069832 (36% of the study sample), the corresponding increase was 3.6% (95% CI, 1.0–6.2%). Differences in the NO2 ( Figure 3 ) and PM2.5 (data not shown) effects across genetic subgroups for different 6-hr exposure windows were similar but weaker. The distributed lag analyses restricted to subjects with at least one minor allele of FGB rs1800790 (GA or AA, 37% of study sample) or one major allele of IL6 2069832 (GA or AA, 83% of study sample) for 6-hr and 24-hr time windows showed associations with increased IL-6 for increases in CO for the 0–5 hr and 6–11 hr preceding sampling [see Supplemental Material, Figure 1 (doi: 10.1289/ehp.0800370.S1)]. The IL-6 increase seen in minor allele holders of FGB rs1800790 for 0–23 hr exposure of CO seemed to be mainly driven by exposure in the 6–11 hr time window. We found a similar but weaker pattern for 0–23 hr exposure in major allele holders of IL6 rs2069832.\nFigure 3 – Modification by IL6 rs2069832 and FGB rs1800790 genotypes of IL-6 response to increased ambient CO and NO2 in association with 6-hr exposure windows preceding blood sampling.

S1)], modification of the IL-6 response to preceding 0–24 hr average of increased CO and NO2 showed consistency between the pollutants, with the clearest effect modification seen in Helsinki, Barcelona, and Athens. For FGB rs1800790 [see Supplemental Material, Figure 3 (doi: 10.1289/ehp.0800370.S1)], we found the strongest effect modification in Athens and Augsburg, and the effects were consistent for both pollutants except in Stockholm. Although we found variation across cities because of reduced power in the city-specific analyses, we found no significant heterogeneity of city- specific effects (p-value > 0.1).\nDiscussion\nWe found evidence of gene–environment interaction where the SNPs IL6 rs2069832 and FGB rs1800790 modified the effects of air pollution on IL-6 levels in MI survivors. All pollutants showed similar patterns of effect, but results were most apparent for CO. The influence of CO on IL-6 levels was strongest in subjects with the major allele of IL6 rs2069832 and the minor allele of FGB rs1800790, and the combination of these two genetic variants, present in 16% of subjects, resulted in a significant gene–gene–environment interaction, potentially indicating a higher risk for health effects from air pollution in these patients with ischemic heart disease. We found similar magnitudes of effect modification with respect to air pollution for IL6 rs2069840 and IL6 rs2069845, but we found no effect modification for FGA rs2070011.\nWe found small effects of air pollution on IL-6 levels in the overall population. The groups defined by the minor allele of FGB rs1800790, and to a lesser extent by the major allele of IL6 rs2069832, seem to be the driving force between the associations seen, suggesting a restriction of the effect of air pollution to groups of MI survivors of specific genotypes.\nNO2 was the pollutant with the most convincing effects on IL-6 levels with respect to the a priori specified time window of exposure (0–24 hr) when considering the overall population, regardless of genotype. Modification of air pollution effects by SNPs was, however, clearest for CO, although the other pollutants in general followed a similar pattern. CO has been proposed as a probable culprit to cardiovascular effects of air pollution ( Dales 2004 ; McGrath 2000 ) in addition to PM. In this study we did not have sufficient power to more specifically identify the most important air pollution component or source, and we acknowledge that we studied a mixture of correlated pollutants. Ambient CO levels measured using fixed monitors have been shown to correlate better to personal exposure to PM rather than to personal exposure to CO ( Sarnat et al. 2005 ; Schwartz et al. 2007 ), so although sensitivity analyses adjusting for the level of PM2.5 in the models showed support for an independent effect of CO (data not shown), we can not be sure of a specific CO effect. Secondary analyses showed that the interaction effect was clearest and strongest during the first 24 hr and particularly 6–11 hr preceding blood withdrawal, consistent with the short half-life of IL-6. The early effect was further supported by the distributed lag analyses of the subjects carrying the risk allele for IL6 rs2069832 and FGB rs1800790. Given the strong correlation of 6-hr exposure windows, it is probable that effects seen for exposure window 12–17 hr and possibly also 0–5 hr reflect this correlation rather than independent effects of these exposure windows.\nAlthough FGB rs1800790 displayed an interaction effect with CO on IL-6 levels, we found no effect of the polymorphism on IL-6 in these patients when not taking air pollution into account. A previous study of the same population ( Jacquemin et al. 2008 ) investigating the effect of fibrinogen polymorphisms on fibrinogen plasma levels found no interaction effect with high levels of IL-6 on fibrinogen levels for this polymorphism, in contrast to FGA rs2070011. However, a follow-up study ( Peters et al. 2009 ) showed that FGB rs1800790 modified the effect of a 5-day average exposure to ambient PM on circulating fibrinogen levels. The production of fibrinogen is stimulated by IL-6, but there is also evidence both in vivo ( Szaba and Smiley 2002 ) and in vitro ( Robson et al. 1994 ) suggesting a positive feedback mechanism whereby fibrinogen products in turn stimulate IL-6 production and release from monocytes. Although this might suggest that the increased IL-6 levels seen in MI survivors with a minor allelic genotype of FGB rs1800790 are mediated via increased fibrinogen levels, the effects on IL-6 levels occurred within 12 hr rather than after 5 days.\nIn this study, subjects with major alleles of IL6 rs2069832 and rs2069845 had lower IL-6 concentrations than did those with minor alleles, but they seemed to react more strongly to CO exposure than did minor allele holders. The reason for this pattern is unclear. Our previous study (Ljungman et al. 2008) revealed a tendency of a greater within-individual variability for major allele holders compared with minor allele holders. Taken together, this may indicate that major allele holders are more likely to respond with inflammation to stimuli such as air pollution but from a lower basal level of IL-6.\nAir pollution has been associated in epidemiologic studies with the onset of MIs in both previously healthy subjects and cardiac patients ( Peters et al. 2001 ; Zanobetti and Schwartz 2005 ). In addition, human experimental ( Mills et al. 2007 ) and epidemiologic ( Chuang et al. 2008 ) studies have demonstrated an effect of air pollution on ST-segment changes in electrocardiograms indicating the triggering of acute ischemia. The gene–environment interaction observed for these two SNPs in our study emphasizes that certain genetic subgroups of cardiac patients may react more strongly toward air pollution than do others. Similar genetic interaction with air pollutants has been seen in human and animal models for lung disease ( Kleeberger 2003 ; London 2007 ) and oxidative stress ( Romieu et al. 2006 ; Schwartz et al. 2005 ). Although both the IL6 and FGB genes are probable candidates affecting the levels of the known cardiovascular biomarker IL-6, the actual polymorphisms responsible for the observed effect modification may be other strongly correlated SNPs or combinations of SNPs. Indeed, in our population, IL6 rs2069832 has very high LD with IL6 rs1800795, a functional SNP located in the promoter region. The reason for focusing on IL6 rs2069832 instead of IL6 rs1800795 was that the overall pooled effects of IL6 rs1800795 on IL-6 levels showed slightly more heterogeneity across cities (Ljungman et al. 2008). To confirm the effects of the studied polymorphisms, functional analyses are required, and as our analyses suggest, the nature of possible gene–gene interaction effects in combinations of SNPs possibly in different genes are of interest. In order to verify whether these data have any prognostic significance, follow-up of clinical ischemic events has to be performed.\nStrengths and limitations. We conducted this study with data from six European cities, thereby providing six independent samples for testing gene–environment interactions. We focus here on genes that, applying a meta-analytical approach across all cities, were associated with gene–environment interactions.\nThe different cities, however, reflect not only a large variation of air pollution exposure, which was desirable, but also other differences possibly confounding our results. To control for this variation, we applied a two-step approach, starting with city-specific models and thereafter pooling the results and checking for evidence of heterogeneity. This test, however, suffers from low power, and the interaction effects showed some disparity across cities. We found clearer effects in Athens and Barcelona than in Helsinki or Stockholm. The southern European cities showed the highest mean levels and the greatest variability in CO levels, whereas Stockholm and Helsinki showed very little variation and considerably lower mean levels. A sensitivity analysis excluding Athens did reduce the effect estimates for CO and increased the p-values of interaction, whereas results for NO2 and PM2.5 were essentially unchanged (data not shown). However, we present here a pooled analysis of six independently conducted studies based on a common protocol. Therefore, we regard the a priori planned analyses as valid, which include all cities, and especially those with the large exposure contrasts and therefore more power. By and large, the effects for CO were corroborated by those for NO2. The remaining differences might be attributed to possible differences in measurement error for the pollutants, as well as possible differences in how representative the fixed monitors are of urban background levels of the various pollutants. The low-risk allele showed point estimates below zero for the IL6 SNP and the combined SNPs in relation to increased CO, for which we have no clear explanation, but because we found no such tendency for the same genotypes in relation to NO2, this may be a chance finding. The temporal relationship between exposure and effect within 12 hr generally fits the expected rise and fall of IL-6 response in the bloodstream. A fair amount of measurement error was seen for IL-6, but we expect that this would not be associated with air pollution levels and therefore would lead to nondifferential misclassification, potentially attenuating our results.\nWe had expected a stronger main effect of CO and NO2 on IL-6 levels, but because air pollution is strongly linked to cardiovascular mortality, survivors of MI—although at high absolute risk for future cardiovascular events—may be less susceptible to the effects of air pollution in a relative sense than the general population. Nevertheless, our results indicate that groups of these individuals identified by specific genotypes are at increased risk of a systemic inflammatory response in association with exposure to continuous ambient air pollution. Should this increase in IL-6 be confirmed to have prognostic implications, these individuals could be identified and protected with counseling such as avoidance of traffic or going outdoors at periods of high risk, for example, within the first month after an MI or during highly polluted days. Furthermore, they might be helped by more rigorous medication.\nConclusion\nThe results support our hypothesis that the effect of air pollution on inflammation may be stronger in certain genetic subpopulations of cardiac patients. Polymorphisms in the IL6 genes modified the IL-6 response when exposed to increased air pollution in the 6–11 hr period preceding sampling, consistent with biological expectation. The role of FGB rs1800790 also seemed important, although the rapid effect was unexpected. Combining these polymorphisms also showed a gene–gene interaction, possibly implicating that one-sixth of the population of MI survivors is at particular risk for effects of air pollution. Whether these differences in air-pollution–mediated inflammation have any prognostic importance remains to be clarified, as well as the possible role of these polymorphisms in air pollution effects on earlier stages of cardiovascular morbidity.\nReferences\nAnonymous. 2000.

In order to achieve this, various cross-sections of extruded aluminium were chosen and their behaviour under dynamic impact loading was investigated. The crash boxes were made from aluminium alloy 6060 temper T4. Finite element software LS-DYNA in ANSYS was used for modelling. For each cross-section, the results of dynamic crushing load versus crushing distance was obtained from the FE simulation and the results were compared with the experimental and numerical work on a square crash box in the literature. Parameters such as the crush force efficiency and the specific energy of various crash boxes were compared with the relevant ones for the square crash box and the most efficient crash box was recommended.\nInfo:\nJ.

The characteristics of the crashworthiness and energy absorption of the pillar pendulum which have different design parameters, such as shapes and thickness, et. al., are emphasized particularly in the paper. A simple finite element model of SUV is established, the effect of different design parameters of stiffness of body cover to the whole distribution of energy absorption and the reasonable transfer of total energy is discussed. The noticeable issue and advice on body design of SUV is proposed.\n620\nCrashworthiness Design for Reinforced Thin-Walled Column under Oblique Impact Using a Magic Cube Approach\nAuthors: Shu Yang, Chang Qi, Dong Ming Guo\nAbstract: This paper is concerned with crashworthiness design of a reinforced thin-walled column under oblique impact. To transform the failure mode of the column under oblique loads from low energy-absorption global bending to high energy-absorption progressive collapse, Magic Cube (MQ) approach, a systematic design approach, is employed to assist the design process: by applying time (process) decomposition, the original difficult nonlinear dynamic crashworthiness design problem is converted into a sequence of simplified linear design problems; by applying multi-domain topology optimization technique to the simplified linear design problems, the optimal configuration of the reinforcement is obtained. Numerical simulation results show that, compared with the original column with same weight, the optimal reinforced thin-walled column has higher energy absorption performance and lower initial crushing force under oblique impact.\n1175\nAnalysis on Impact Performance of Aluminum Automotive Side Member\nAuthors: M. Salleh Salwani, Aidy Ali, Sahari B. Barkawi, A.A. Nuraini, A.A. Faieza, Tuan Hafandi Tuan Ismail, J. Mai Nursherida, Azim Azizi, Nabilah Mohd Safar, Siti Aini Satuan, Shahril Mohamad, Norhidayah Muhamed\nAbstract: In this study an aluminium alloy is introduced as an alternative lightweight material in automotive industry. In order to achieve lightweight design, the study was undertaken on a side member of automotive parts. Crashworthiness performance of AA5182 side member is compared to the automotive steel side member. By designing 16 experiments based on full factorial design, the effect of thickness with four levels on the crash performance of the AA5182 side member was investigated for each loading conditions, axial and oblique loading. Mass, energy absorbed and maximum force is set as the evaluation criterion and the full factorial design has presented several designs to serve the evaluated criterion.\n209\nThe Effect of Material Parameters on Crashworthiness of Vehicle Steering Column\nAuthors: Xiao Hua Song, Jing Liu\nAbstract: The drivers were hurt seriously by the vehicle steering column in the frontal collision. So a steering column with well energy-absorbing is very useful for the drivers. In this paper, the crashworthiness of a vehicle steering column is investigated by using the explicit dynamics finite element analysis method. Based on the proposed finite element model, the steering column with different material parameters including elastic modulus and yield strength are analyzed. Moreover, the displacement, velocity and energy absorption is discussed. The simulation results show that the crashworthiness of the vehicle steering column is significantly influenced by the yield strength. However, the elastic modulus has little effect on the crashworthiness.\n3\nCrashworthiness Analysis and Optimization of Thin-Walled Square Tube with Pyramidal Ripples Based on Mechanics Properties\nAuthors: Xiao Guang Hu, Jing Bo Yang\nAbstract: Thin-walled structure absorbs most impact kinetic energy during collision accident,and they are widely used as energy-absorbing element. In order to improve crashworthiness of them, regular pyramidal ripple is added on the thin-walled square tube’s surface. Explicit finite element technology is applied to simulate the behavior of the tube under axial impact load. Simulation data was delt with by Response Surface Method to form a function of variables and response,and the new structure was optimized. Research results show that, the thin-walled square tube with pyramidal ripples can improve controllable of structure deformation obviously and Optimized structure can absorb and dissipate much more impact kinetic energy.\n69\n""","0.017841019","""https://www.scientific.net/KEM.348-349.661""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

In a critical review of the relation between urban design and highway engineering, the paper distinguishes two paradigms: on one side, the hierarchical model, pervasive and institutionally entrenched through design standards and traffic management; on the other, an alternative non-hierarchical paradigm which has developed piecemeal and experimentally on the back of policies for social exclusion, city centre regeneration, liveable neighbourhoods and neo-traditional urbanism. The paper discusses the tension between the two frameworks and highlights the health, safety and environmental arguments for reinventing the mixed-use urban street. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.\nPublication data is maintained in RPS.

Applied Energy, 111. pp. 206-218. ISSN 0306-2619\nFull text not available from this repository.\nAbstract\nMany researchers and industry observers claim that electric vehicles (EV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) could provide vehicle-to-grid (V2G) bulk energy and ancillary services to an electricity network. This work quantified the impact on various battery characteristics whilst providing such services. The sensitivity of the impact of V2G services on battery degradation was assessed for EV and PHEV for different battery capacities, charging regimes, and battery depth of discharge. Battery degradation was found to be most dependent on energy throughput for both the EV and PHEV powertrains, but was most sensitive to charging regime (for EVs) and battery capacity (for PHEVs). When providing ancillary services, battery degradation in both powertrains was most sensitive to individual vehicle battery depth of discharge. Degradation arising from both bulk energy and ancillary services could be minimised by reducing the battery capacity of the vehicle, restricting the number of hours connected and reducing the depth of discharge of each vehicle for ancillary services. Regardless, best case minimum impacts of providing V2G services are severe such as to require multiple battery pack replacements over the vehicle lifetime. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\nItem Type:\n""","1.0","""http://publications.eng.cam.ac.uk/578299/""",

ISSN 1361-9209\nFull text not available from this repository.\nAbstract\nThis paper uses a patent data set to identify factors fostering innovation of diesel engines between 1974 and 2010 in the OECD region. The propensity of engine producers to innovate grew by 1.9 standard deviations after the expansion of the car market, by 0.7 standard deviations following a shift in the EU fuel economy standard, and by 0.23 standard deviations. The propensity to develop emissions control techniques was positively influenced by pollution control laws introduced in Japan, in the US, and in the EU, but not with the expansion of the car market. Furthermore, a decline in loan rates stimulated the propensity to develop emissions control techniques, which were simultaneously crowded out by increases in publicly-funded transport research and development. Innovation activities in engine efficiency are explained by market size, loan rates and by (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) diesel prices, inclusive of taxes. Price effects on innovation, outweigh that of the US corporate average fuel economy standards. Innovation is also positively influenced by past transport research and development. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.\nItem Type:\n""","0.77428937","""http://publications.eng.cam.ac.uk/624083/""",

This increase in air traffic may adversely affect safety if appropriate measures are not taken. Regulators and Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) analyze incidents to identify ways to prevent them from happening again. Incidents are rare events in airspace, and this poses problems with robust statistical testing and trend analysis. Aviation safety analysis uses the Poisson distribution where possible, but doubts remain as to its appropriateness. Incident data from ANSP were analyzed over 17 years in a logical quantitative manner using extreme value theory (EVT), a method that uses the limited amount of information available on incidents and defines a distribution that can be used to make statistical inferences. EVT has had considerable use in other fields but little in aviation. A statistical analysis and validation framework is outlined and used to test the data using Poisson, negative binomial, and EVT. The goodness-of-fit tests, as well as other statistical tests, indicate that by far the best fit of the data is achieved using EVT. Further analysis using EVT shows its efficacy as a tool for monitoring and predicting incidents, based on statistical hypothesis and the use of quantile information.\n< >\nTransportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board\nTransportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board\nPrint ISSN: 0361-1981\n""","0.7426039","""http://trrjournalonline.trb.org/doi/10.3141/2106-15""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

All participants had documented evidence of GORD and symptoms for >12 months.\nIntervention The type of laparoscopic fundoplication used was left to the discretion of the surgeon. Those allocated to medical treatment had their treatment reviewed and adjusted as necessary by a local gastroenterologist, and subsequent clinical management was at the discretion of the clinician responsible for care.\nMain outcome measures The disease specific REFLUX quality of life score (primary outcome), SF-36, EQ-5D, and medication use, measured at time points equivalent to three and 12 months after surgery, and surgical complications.\nMain results Randomised participants had received drugs for GORD for median of 32 months before trial entry. Baseline REFLUX scores were 63.6 (SD 24.1) and 66.8 (SD 24.5) in the surgical and medical randomised groups, respectively. Of those randomised to surgery, 111 (62%) actually had total or partial fundoplication. Surgical complications were uncommon with a conversion rate of 0.6% and no mortality. By 12 months, 38% (59/154) randomised to surgery (14% (14/104) among those who had fundoplication) were taking reflux medication versus 90% (147/164) randomised medical management. The REFLUX score favoured the randomised surgical group (14.0, 95% confidence interval 9.6 to 18.4; P<0.001). Differences of a third to half of 1 SD in other health status measures also favoured the randomised surgical group. Baseline scores in the preference for surgery group were the worst; by 12 months these were better than in the preference for medical treatment group.\nConclusion At least up to 12 months after surgery, laparoscopic fundoplication significantly increased measures of health status in patients with GORD.\nTrial registration ISRCTN15517081 .\nIntroduction\nGastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) causes some of the most commonly seen symptoms in both primary and secondary care. 1 Most have only mild symptoms and require little if any medication. A small minority have severe reflux and, despite full medical treatment, have complications or persistent symptoms requiring surgical intervention. For the remainder, control of symptoms requires regular or intermittent medical treatment, usually with proton pump inhibitors, and it is from this intermediate group that most of the treatment costs arise. While there is wide agreement that proton pump inhibitors, sometimes combined with prokinetic agents, are the most effective treatment for moderate to severe GORD, they can cause a spectrum of short term symptoms, 2 and there are concerns about the impact of long term use through profound acid suppression. 3\nInterest in surgery as an alternative to long term medical treatment has been considerable since the introduction of the minimal access laparoscopic approach in the early 1990s. The operation (fundoplication) involves partial or total wrapping of the fundus of the stomach around the lower oesophagus to recreate a high pressure zone. Although fundoplication produces resolution of reflux symptoms in up to 90% of patients, 4 we do not know whether exchanging symptoms associated with best medical management for those of the side effects of surgery is advantageous for the patient and a good use of healthcare resources.\nWe carried out a multicentre pragmatic randomised trial (with parallel non-randomised preference groups to contextualise the results and augment them, particularly in respect of surgical complications), 5 evaluating the clinical effectiveness, safety, and costs of a policy of relatively early laparoscopic surgery compared with optimised medical management of GORD for people judged suitable for both policies.\nMethods\nParticipants\nPatients were eligible if they had more than 12 months’ symptoms requiring maintenance treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (or alternative) for reasonable control; they had endoscopic or 24 hour pH monitoring evidence of GORD, or both; they were suitable for either policy (including American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade I or II); and the recruiting doctor was uncertain which management policy to follow. Exclusion criteria were morbid obesity (BMI >40); Barrett’s oesophagus of more than 3 cm or with evidence of dysplasia; para-oesophageal hernia; and oesophageal stricture.\nWe invited any eligible patient who did not want to take part in the randomised trial because of a strong preference about treatment to join a non-randomised preference arm. An independent data monitoring committee recommended continued recruitment on each of the three occasions that it confidentially reviewed accumulating data.\nClinical management\nClinical management aimed to optimise current care in participating centres. Participating clinical centres had local partnerships between surgeons (who had performed at least 50 laparoscopic fundoplication operations) and gastroenterologists with whom they shared the secondary care of patients with GORD. They, supported by local research nurses, informed participants about the randomised trial and invited them to take part. It was only at this point that participants who declined to take part in the randomised trial, because of a strong preference either for remaining on medical treatment or for undergoing surgery, were informed about, and given the opportunity to take part in, the preference study.\nFor all participants in either the randomised or preference surgical group, surgery could be subsequently deferred or declined, by either the participant or surgeon (that is, even after trial entry). In the absence of erosive oesophagitis on endoscopy, and when necessary to exclude achalasia, manometry or pH studies were performed before surgery. A lead surgeon (or a less experienced surgeon working under supervision) undertook the surgery. Routine crural repair and non-absorbable synthetic sutures were recommended. The type of fundoplication was left to the discretion of the surgeon, who recorded intraoperative details on a specially designed study form. For the purposes of the main comparisons, we considered the different fundoplication techniques as a single policy. Those allocated to medical treatment had their treatment reviewed and adjusted as necessary by a local gastroenterologist to be “best medical management,” based on the Genval workshop report. 6 The medical protocol included the option of surgery if a clear indication developed after randomisation. In all other respects, clinical management was at the discretion of the clinician responsible for care.\nOutcome measures\nOutcome measures were those judged important to patients and health services. The primary outcome was the REFLUX questionnaire score, a validated “disease specific” measure incorporating assessment of reflux and other gastrointestinal symptoms and the side effects and complications of both treatments (score range 0 to 100, the higher the score the better the patients felt). 7 The score was derived from the weighted average of six questions on quality of life (heartburn; acid reflux; eating and swallowing; bowel movements; sleep; and work, physical, and social activities). Five symptom scores were also developed as secondary measures (general discomfort; wind and frequency; nausea and vomiting; limitation in activity; constipation and swallowing). Participants were followed up by postal questionnaire three and 12 months after surgery or at an equivalent time among those who did not have surgery; the medical participants were linked to surgical participants who had been randomised at about the same time. Issues related to long, variable length, waiting lists prohibited timing of follow-up from randomisation. Other prestated outcome measures were health status (EQ-5D, based on UK public preference values, and SF-36); serious morbidity, such as operative complications; and mortality.\nSample size\nWe originally intended to recruit 300 participants to each trial group to identify a difference between the randomised groups of 0.25 of 1 SD in the disease specific REFLUX score (80% power; α=0.05) 12 months after surgery. In January 2003, however, in part prompted by a lower rate of recruitment than expected, we revised this target in consultation with the data monitoring committee and representatives of the funders. It was agreed that a slightly larger but still moderate sized benefit (0.3 of 1 SD, equivalent to seven points on the REFLUX quality of life score) was clinically plausible based on improvements reported in other studies 8 9 after surgery among more severely affected people. We calculated that this required 196 in each group to give 80% power (α=0.05), assuming 10% attrition (that is, 176 per group with 12 month follow-up).\nRandomisation\nRandom allocation was organised centrally by a secure system, using a computer generated sequence, stratified by clinical site, with balance in respect of age (18-49 or ≥50), sex (men or women), and BMI (≤28 or >29) secured by minimisation. Staff in the central trial office entered details of participants on the secure database, then notified participants and respective clinical sites of their allocation. There was no subsequent blinding.\nThe figure ⇓ summarises the stages of the trial. The first 146 randomised participants (70 allocated to surgery and 76 allocated to medical management) were sent details of their allocation at the same time as the baseline questionnaires. This was changed at the request of the data monitoring committee such that subsequent allocations were generated only once completed baseline forms had been returned. The committee were concerned that if patients were to receive their allocation before completing the questionnaire this could potentially affect their responses.\nFlow of participants through trial\nDownload powerpoint\nStatistical methods\nOur primary analysis in the randomised trial was by intention to treat. General linear models adjusted for the minimisation covariates (age, BMI, and sex) and, when appropriate, for baseline score and interaction between baseline score and treatment. We also included a covariate to adjust for the change in practice regarding the baseline questionnaires. All analyses used 95% confidence intervals. Because a relatively large proportion of the randomised surgical participants did not receive surgery, we also performed per protocol analyses and analyses adjusted for treatment received 10 11 to estimate efficacy of treatment. For the preference groups, we analysed statistically only the primary outcome, the REFLUX score. This analysis compared the group who preferred surgery with the group who preferred medical treatment and adjusted for the minimisation factors. We did not plan to adjust for the baseline score using analysis of covariance methods in the analysis of the preference groups given the anticipated non-random imbalances at baseline.\nResults\nRecruitment took place in 21 centres in the United Kingdom from March 2001 to June 2004: 357 participants were in the randomised arm (178 allocated to surgery and 179 to medical management) and 453 in the preference arm (261 chose surgery and 192 chose medical management) (figure). ⇑ The three and 12 month follow-ups were conducted an average of 86 and 360 days after surgery, respectively, and this was equivalent to 300 and 570 days (580 and 540 days in the randomised surgical and medical groups, respectively) after randomisation across all the trial groups; three and 12 month follow-up questionnaires were received from 86% and 89% participants, respectively. Three participants died, two in the preference for surgery group and one in the randomised medical group; none had surgery. All deaths were unrelated to trial participation.\nDescription of the groups at trial entry\nThe characteristics of the randomised participants (table 1 ⇓ , baseline rates for medication in table 2 ⇓ , and table A on bmj.com) were similar and lay between those in the preference groups; participants in the preference for surgery group were younger and had been prescribed medication for GORD for longer; participants in the preference for medical treatment group were older, more likely to be women, and had been prescribed medication for a shorter time.\nTable 1\nView inline\nSimilar patterns in the randomised groups were seen in the SF-36 scores, where the biggest differences favouring surgery were observed in the general health and bodily pain dimensions and in the EQ-5D score (see tables B, C, and D on bmj.com), although with some evidence of attenuation at 12 months. Three participants died, one in the randomised medical group (road traffic incident) and two in the preference surgical group, neither of whom had surgery (alcoholic liver disease and cause unknown).\nPossible side effects of surgery\nNo differences were detected between the trial groups in their questionnaire responses at 12 months regarding “difficulty swallowing” and “bloatedness/trapped wind,” but there was some evidence of more frequent “wind from the lower bowel” after surgery.\nPreference groups\nThe participants in the preference for surgery group had lower mean REFLUX scores at baseline than those in the preference for medical treatment group (55.8 v 77.5). Despite this, at follow-up at 12 months, according to intention to treat analysis (difference 3.9, −0.2 to 8.0; P=0.064) and per protocol analysis (6.3, 2.4 to 10.2; P=0.002) the REFLUX score favoured the preference surgical group.\nFor participants in the preference group, other quality of life scores also tended to favour the surgical group. The differences between the preference groups, however, were less marked than the differences between the randomised groups, mainly because the preference for medical treatment group had better scores than the randomised medical group at baseline and follow-up.\nDiscussion\nPrincipal findings\nIn patients with GORD, laparoscopic fundoplication results in better symptom relief and improved quality of life compared with optimised medical treatment. There were highly significant differences between the randomised groups in the REFLUX scores three months after surgery (a half to a third of 1 SD) favouring surgery, and these were broadly sustained nine months later. The lower the REFLUX scores at entry—that is, the worse the symptoms—the larger were the improvements after surgery. Similar differences were seen in most of the other measures of health status. There was, however, some evidence of a narrowing of the differences between three and 12 months, particularly for the EQ-5D. Data on drug treatment were consistent with this, showing more use in the surgical groups at 12 months than at three months. There were small improvements in scores in the medical groups; this might reflect their having specialist review at trial entry to optimise their drug treatment.\nThose who agreed to join the randomised trial had baseline characteristics between the two preference groups. The results in the preference groups were consistent with the randomised comparison: scores after surgery in those who preferred surgery were somewhat higher than in those who preferred medical treatment, despite starting from much lower baseline levels. None of the three participants who died had surgery and complications were uncommon; but confidence intervals around estimated frequencies were wide despite inclusion of all 319 surgical participants, leaving important uncertainty about the magnitude of surgical risk.\nStrengths and weaknesses\nWe used a pragmatic trial design, with many UK patients, centres and experienced surgeons, thus allowing the results to be interpreted within a “real life” NHS context. The addition of the preference groups gives an indication of probable behaviour if surgery were to become more freely available.\nWe explored the impact of a third of those randomised to surgery not having fundoplication: firstly, through per protocol analyses limited to those randomised who received their allocated management, and, secondly, through an adjusted approach 10 11 in an attempt to circumvent the probable selection bias of per protocol analyses. In the event, these two approaches gave similar results. The direction of effects was so clear that we observed significant differences even in the most conservative intention to treat analyses. While the intention to treat analyses estimate unbiased average effects on compliers and non-compliers, the adjusted analyses estimate bias adjusted average treatment effects on those who comply with treatment. In general, an adjusted analysis is preferable to a per protocol analysis as it is less likely to be biased.\nThe protocol allowed surgeons to use the type of fundoplication with which they were familiar, principally to avoid any learning effects. There is mixed evidence for the use of a total wrap or partial wrap. 12 We explored possible differential effects of total versus partial wrap fundoplication in an observational analysis and found no evidence of a difference within either the randomised, preference, or per protocol groups (difference in 12 month REFLUX score −1.3 (−7.9 to 5.2), P=0.687).\nOur study was limited to patients who were on long term acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors, who had symptoms that were reasonably controlled, and who were clinically suitable for either policy; it is to these sorts of patients with GORD that the results are generalisable. Potential participants were not easy to identify and recruit, and this led to slow recruitment. Most patients taking long term proton pump inhibitor treatment are managed in general practice, often through a repeat prescription system, whereas our trial was based in secondary care. We used three approaches to identify potentially eligible patients: retrospective review of hospital case notes; prospective identification, especially through endoscopy clinics; and (in selected centres) public advertisements. All potentially eligible patients then had to be assessed clinically, often through specially established monthly clinics, before being formally approached about the trial. Those approached often expressed clear preferences, reflecting the marked differences between the policies being compared.\nThe trial was conducted at a time when there was great pressure on surgical services in the NHS, with long delays for elective surgery for non-life threatening benign conditions. Indeed, the average time between trial entry and surgery was eight to nine months. Some participants experienced long delays before being formally offered surgery, and this was an important factor in their eventual decision to choose not to have surgery after all. While patient’s choice was the commonest reason for not having surgery, about a third of those who did not have fundoplication after allocation to surgery were refused surgery for clinical reasons: most commonly, the surgeon disagreed with the recruiting doctor that symptoms were sufficient to justify surgery or judged that the patient was not sufficiently fit (such as overweight) or the symptoms had improved since randomisation,\nThe standard rule in most trials is to time follow-up from randomisation. This was not appropriate in our trial because of the variable time between randomisation and surgery, exacerbated by the waiting list problem. The protocol specified follow-up at a time equivalent to three and 12 months after surgery. It was important to have follow-up in the medical groups at an equivalent time. We arranged this by setting the follow-up of medical participants at time points equivalent to three months and 12 months after surgery.\nWe focused directly on subjective measures of outcome (patient reported measures) rather than on objective measures of outcome. This was intentional and appropriate for the pragmatic evaluation of the interventions. In clinical practice, pH is not routinely measured after surgery. If we had included such objective outcome measures, this would have entailed our changing the regular management practices for these patients, thus jeopardising the generalisability of both our intervention and our findings.\nComparison with other studies\nWe identified two other randomised trials comparing laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication with continued medical management. 13 14 They were less pragmatic in design with fewer participants (217 13 and 104 14 ), centres (two 13 and one 14 ), and surgeons (two 13 and four 14 ) and reported postoperative 24 hour pH measurement. The results of the two trials were consistent with ours. Across all trials, there were significantly greater improvements after surgery in measures of gastrointestinal and general wellbeing. While no major intraoperative complications were reported among the 52 patients who had surgery in one trial, 14 in the other trial there were four major complications and four reoperations, including one case of gastric resection, among the 109 patients who had fundoplication, 13 illustrating the potential risks of the procedure.\nConclusions\nLaparoscopic fundoplication significantly increased health status at least to 12 months after surgery.  Surgery does carry costs, however, and we will report investigation of cost effectiveness elsewhere.  The narrowing of differences in health status between three and 12 months could reflect a postoperative placebo effect or could indicate decreasing effectiveness of surgery over time from surgery (as has been observed after open fundoplication 9 ). We have therefore instituted annual follow-up using similar questionnaires and plan to report long term effectiveness after five years of follow-up.\nWhat is already known on this topic\nMany people require regular proton pump inhibitors to control symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and there are concerns regarding the impact of long term use\nLaparoscopic fundoplication can relieve symptoms of reflux, but side effects of surgery might be worse than symptoms associated with the best medical management\nWhat this study adds\nAt one year follow-up reflux specific symptoms and general quality of life were better in patients who underwent laparoscopic fundoplication compared with those receiving optimised medical treatment\nNotes\nCite this as: BMJ 2008;337:a2664\nFootnotes\nWe thank Maureen G C Gillan, Marie Cameron, and Christiane Pflanz-Sinclair for their assistance in study coordination, recruitment of participants, and follow-up; Sharon McCann, who was involved in piloting the practical arrangements of this trial; Allan Walker for database and programming support; and Janice Cruden and Pauline Garden for their secretarial support and data management.\nTrial coordination team\nGarry Barton (1999-2002), Laura Bojke, Marion Campbell, David Epstein, Adrian Grant, Sue Macran, Craig Ramsay, Mark Sculpher, Samantha Wileman.\nTrial steering group\nWendy Atkin (chair, independent of trial), John Bancewicz, Ara Darzi, Robert Heading, Janusz Jankowski (independent of trial), Zygmunt Krukowski, Richard Lilford (independent of trial), Iain Martin (1997-2000), Ashley Mowat, Ian Russell, Mark Thursz.\nData monitoring committee\nJon Nicholl, Chris Hawkey, Iain MacIntyre (all independent of trial)\nMembers of the REFLUX trial group responsible for recruitment in the clinical centres\nA Mowat, Z Krukowski, E El-Omar, P Phull, T Sinclair, L Swan (Aberdeen Royal Infirmary); B Clements, J Collins, A Kennedy, H Lawther (Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast); D Bennett, N Davies, S Toop, P Winwood (Royal Bournemouth Hospital); D Alderson, P Barham, K Green, R Mittal (Bristol Royal Infirmary); M Asante, S El Hasani (Princess Royal University Hospital, Bromley); A De Beaux, R Heading, L Meekison, S Paterson-Brown, H Barkell (Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh); G Ferns, M Bailey, N Karanjia, TA Rockall, L Skelly (Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford); M Dakkak, C Royston, P Sedman (Hull Royal Infirmary); K Gordon, L F Potts, C Smith, PL Zentler-Munro, A Munro (Raigmore Hospital, Inverness); S Dexter, P Moayeddi (General Infirmary at Leeds); DM Lloyd (Leicester Royal Infirmary); V Loh, M Thursz, A Darzi (St Mary’s Hospital, London); A Ahmed, R Greaves, A Sawyerr, J Wellwood, T Taylor (Whipps Cross Hospital, London); S Hosking, S Lowrey, J Snook (Poole Hospital); P Goggin, T Johns, A Quine, S Somers, S Toh (Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth); J Bancewicz, M Greenhalgh, W Rees (Hope Hospital, Salford); CVN Cheruvu, M Deakin, S Evans, J Green, F Leslie (North Staffordshire Hospital, Stoke-on-Trent); J N Baxter, P Duane, M M Rahman, M Thomas, J Williams (Morriston Hospital, Swansea); D Maxton, A Sigurdsson, M S H Smith, G Townson (Princess Royal Hospital, Telford); C Buckley, S Gore, RH Kennedy, Z H Khan, J Knight (Yeovil District Hospital); D Alexander, G Miller, D Parker, A Turnbull, J Turvill (York District Hospital).\nContributors: AMG was the principal grant holder and contributed to development of the trial protocol and preparation of the paper and had overall responsibility for the conduct of the trial.

In order to achieve this, various cross-sections of extruded aluminium were chosen and their behaviour under dynamic impact loading was investigated. The crash boxes were made from aluminium alloy 6060 temper T4. Finite element software LS-DYNA in ANSYS was used for modelling. For each cross-section, the results of dynamic crushing load versus crushing distance was obtained from the FE simulation and the results were compared with the experimental and numerical work on a square crash box in the literature. Parameters such as the crush force efficiency and the specific energy of various crash boxes were compared with the relevant ones for the square crash box and the most efficient crash box was recommended.\nInfo:\nJ.

The characteristics of the crashworthiness and energy absorption of the pillar pendulum which have different design parameters, such as shapes and thickness, et. al., are emphasized particularly in the paper. A simple finite element model of SUV is established, the effect of different design parameters of stiffness of body cover to the whole distribution of energy absorption and the reasonable transfer of total energy is discussed. The noticeable issue and advice on body design of SUV is proposed.\n620\nCrashworthiness Design for Reinforced Thin-Walled Column under Oblique Impact Using a Magic Cube Approach\nAuthors: Shu Yang, Chang Qi, Dong Ming Guo\nAbstract: This paper is concerned with crashworthiness design of a reinforced thin-walled column under oblique impact. To transform the failure mode of the column under oblique loads from low energy-absorption global bending to high energy-absorption progressive collapse, Magic Cube (MQ) approach, a systematic design approach, is employed to assist the design process: by applying time (process) decomposition, the original difficult nonlinear dynamic crashworthiness design problem is converted into a sequence of simplified linear design problems; by applying multi-domain topology optimization technique to the simplified linear design problems, the optimal configuration of the reinforcement is obtained. Numerical simulation results show that, compared with the original column with same weight, the optimal reinforced thin-walled column has higher energy absorption performance and lower initial crushing force under oblique impact.\n1175\nAnalysis on Impact Performance of Aluminum Automotive Side Member\nAuthors: M.

In order to achieve lightweight design, the study was undertaken on a side member of automotive parts. Crashworthiness performance of AA5182 side member is compared to the automotive steel side member. By designing 16 experiments based on full factorial design, the effect of thickness with four levels on the crash performance of the AA5182 side member was investigated for each loading conditions, axial and oblique loading. Mass, energy absorbed and maximum force is set as the evaluation criterion and the full factorial design has presented several designs to serve the evaluated criterion.\n209\nThe Effect of Material Parameters on Crashworthiness of Vehicle Steering Column\nAuthors: Xiao Hua Song, Jing Liu\nAbstract: The drivers were hurt seriously by the vehicle steering column in the frontal collision. So a steering column with well energy-absorbing is very useful for the drivers. In this paper, the crashworthiness of a vehicle steering column is investigated by using the explicit dynamics finite element analysis method. Based on the proposed finite element model, the steering column with different material parameters including elastic modulus and yield strength are analyzed. Moreover, the displacement, velocity and energy absorption is discussed. The simulation results show that the crashworthiness of the vehicle steering column is significantly influenced by the yield strength. However, the elastic modulus has little effect on the crashworthiness.\n3\nCrashworthiness Analysis and Optimization of Thin-Walled Square Tube with Pyramidal Ripples Based on Mechanics Properties\nAuthors: Xiao Guang Hu, Jing Bo Yang\nAbstract: Thin-walled structure absorbs most impact kinetic energy during collision accident,and they are widely used as energy-absorbing element. In order to improve crashworthiness of them, regular pyramidal ripple is added on the thin-walled square tube’s surface. Explicit finite element technology is applied to simulate the behavior of the tube under axial impact load. Simulation data was delt with by Response Surface Method to form a function of variables and response,and the new structure was optimized. Research results show that, the thin-walled square tube with pyramidal ripples can improve controllable of structure deformation obviously and Optimized structure can absorb and dissipate much more impact kinetic energy.\n69\n""","0.32266963","""https://www.scientific.net/KEM.348-349.661""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

Existing work on such mechanisms has typically assumed that participants are fully rational and can report their preferences accurately via some interface to the mechanism or to a software agent participating on their behalf. However, this may not be reasonable in settings with non-expert human end-users.Thus, our overarching aim in this paper is to determine experimentally if a fully expressive market interface that enables accurate preference reports is suitable for the EV charging domain, or, alternatively, if a simpler, restricted interface that reduces the space of possible options is preferable. In doing this, we measure the performance of an interface both in terms of how it helps participants maximise their utility and how it affects deliberation time. Our secondary objective is to contrast two different types of restricted interfaces that vary in how they restrict the space of preferences that can be reported. To enable this analysis, we develop a novel game that replicates key features of an abstract EV charging scenario. In two experiments with over 300 users, we show that restricting the users' preferences significantly reduces the time they spend deliberating (by up to half in some cases). An extensive usability survey confirms that this restriction is furthermore associated with a lower perceived cognitive burden on the users. More surprisingly, at the same time, using restricted interfaces leads to an increase in the users' performance compared to the fully expressive interface (by up to 70%). We also show that some restricted interfaces have the desirable effect of reducing the energy consumption of their users by up to 20% while achieving the same utility as other interfaces. Finally, we find that a reinforcement learning agent displays similar performance trends to human users, enabling a novel methodology for evaluating market interfaces.\n""","10.282589","""http://jair.org/papers/paper5387.html""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

The introduction of the individual electric powertrain provides great capacity for improvement of the vehicle’s energy efficiency and control performance. However, it also poses tremendous challenges concerning vehicle safety, due to the complex system dynamics and cooperation mechanisms between multiactuators.For an electric vehicle with independently controlled motors, because of design and manufacturing factors, the steady-state error of each motor output torque, and the flexibilities and nonlinear backlash of left and right drivetrains, can be different. This results in asymmetrical output characteristics of electric powertrain systems on the same axle. Therefore, during a normal straight-line deceleration, an unexpected yaw moment would be generated, affecting vehicle’s directional stability.In this study, a novel method of directional stability enhancement through robust control of blended braking of an electric vehicle equipped with four individual on-board motors during normal straight-line deceleration are studied. System models, including the vehicle dynamics, tire, electric powertrain, and hydraulic brake models, are developed. Mechanisms of directional instability of the electric vehicle during straight-line braking are analyzed. To further improve the electric vehicle’s safety and performance, robust control algorithm of blended braking is developed using nonlinear sliding mode approach. Simulations of the proposed control strategy is carried out under straight-line braking. The results demonstrate that the developed approach is advantageous over the baseline, with respect to both the directional stability and regeneration efficiency, thus validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the controller synthesis.\nAlso in:\n""","0.45733517","""http://papers.sae.org/2016-01-1669/""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

A mixed methods methodology was adopted using interviews and focus group discussions on three selected case studies of confined construction sites. In addition to these, a questionnaire survey was used based on the findings from the interviews and the focus group discussions. The top five key strategies include (1) Employ safe system of work plans to mitigate personnel health and safety issues; (2) Inform personnel, before starting on-site, of the potential issues using site inductions; (3) Effective communication among site personnel; (4) Draft and implement an effective design site layout prior to starting on-site; and (5) Use of banksman (traffic co-ordinator) to segregate personnel from vehicular traffic. The construction sector is one of the leading industries in accident causation and with the continued development and regeneration of our urban centres, confined site construction is quickly becoming the norm - an environment which only fuels accident creation within the construction sector.

At cruising altitudes (about z = 5–12 km), accurate forecasts for turbulence, icing, and convection are critical for reducing extra costs due to in-flight injuries, structural damage, and flight delays by encountering those hazards (e.g., Sharman et al. 2012 ; Sharman and Lane 2016 ). Reliable predictions of upper-level jet and wind variations can also have a significant impact on optimal flight-routing planning ( Kim et al. 2015 ; 2016 ). Near airports, rapidly updated nowcasts from observing and modeling systems are crucial to identify possible low-level wind shear and downburst events, which can cause serious safety issues for departing and landing airplanes (e.g., Wong et al. 2013 ). From a long-term perspective, a better understanding of the two-way interaction between climate change and aviation may help establish a better strategy for green aviation in the future ( Williams 2016 ).\nDespite the importance of research to aviation meteorology, only a few scientific groups internationally are currently studying these topics. To collaborate and promote research activities in aviation meteorology, the Workshop on Aviation Meteorology has been hosted biennially by Yonsei University (YSU) since 2008. The fundamental goal of this workshop is to find pathways to strengthen collaborations among the active research groups, operational weather forecast centers, and stakeholders, which can improve operational forecasting models and observing techniques to better predict and analyze aviation weather hazards and can eventually mitigate the adverse weather impact on aviation.\nThe participants presented and discussed on-going research results on four main themes: 1) development of global aviation turbulence forecasting systems, 2) improvements in modeling and observing systems of aviation meteorology, 3) local weather forecasts and low-level wind shear, and 4) interaction between aviation and climate change.\nDEVELOPMENT OF GLOBAL AVIATION TURBULENCE FORECASTING SYSTEMS.\nSection:\nAt the requests of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and World Meteorological Organization (WMO), two World Area Forecast Centers (WAFCs) in Washington, United States, and London, United Kingdom, have developed the World Area Forecast System (WAFS), which provides automated and consistent gridded forecasts for global aviation users ( Gill 2012 ). In accordance with ICAO’s Aviation System Block Upgrades (ASBU), ICAO/WMO required the update of the current WAFS grids especially to include severity instead of potentials and to provide probability of all hazards with increases in spatial and temporal resolution. Blending these hazard forecasts with output from third-party providers in addition to the two WAFCs will be considered at a later date.\nHye-Yeong Chun from YSU presented the current status of the Korean Aviation Turbulence Guidance (KTG; Kim and Chun 2012 ) product, which forecasts aviation turbulence over East Asia, and outlined future plans to extend it as a global forecasting system, Global-KTG (G-KTG), to be based on the Global Data Assimilation and Prediction System (GDAPS) developed by the Korean Meteorological Administration (KMA). Evaluation over East Asia shows that the KTG performance depends on the season, higher in winter and fall and lower in summer. This is likely because of the lack of proper turbulence diagnostics to capture convectively induced turbulence (CIT) and a seasonal bias in the underlying GDAPS model. In addition, estimation of atmospheric turbulence in the free atmosphere using high vertical resolution radiosonde data (HVRRD), in conjunction with the project of finescale atmospheric processes (FISAPS) from Stratosphere–Troposphere Processes and their Role in Climate (SPARC; Geller et al. 2016 ), and its application to the aviation meteorology was suggested.\nPhilip Gill from the Met Office in the United Kingdom (WAFC London) presented their efforts on ensemble-based global aviation hazard forecasts. Current global forecasts from the two WAFCs are produced from deterministic model output. To communicate forecast uncertainty, the Met Office Global and Regional Ensemble Prediction System (MOGREPS) is used for probabilistic aviation weather forecasts ( Gill and Buchanan 2014 ). Here, a multimodel ensemble combining MOGREPS and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble is used and evaluated using the observed derived equivalent vertical gust (DEVG) from commercial aircraft for verification.\nMatt Strahan from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Aviation Weather Center (NOAA/AWC; WAFC Washington) introduced the missions and roles of the NOAA/AWC for the WAFS upgrades. Jung-Hoon Kim from NOAA/AWC also presented joint efforts with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) for the development of the Global Graphical Turbulence Guidance (G-GTG) for WAFS upgrades. The current WAFS turbulence grid is based on a single turbulence diagnostic, the Ellrod index ( Ellrod and Knapp 1992 ), which does not directly provide turbulence severity and does not directly consider sources of turbulence other than clear-air turbulence (CAT). In contrast, a recent version of GTG ( Sharman and Pearson 2016 ) provides the energy dissipation rate (EDR; m2/3 s–1), a measure of atmospheric turbulence intensity, which is calculated by optimally combining multiple component diagnostics based on various turbulence sources: CAT, mountain wave–induced turbulence (MWT), and possibly CIT. Using NOAA’s Global Forecast System (GFS) and global EDR observational data ( Sharman et al. 2014 ) for one month (October 2015), it was shown that the new global EDR forecast from the G-GTG has better performance skill than the current WAFS turbulence forecast.\nIMPROVEMENTS IN MODELING AND OBSERVING SYSTEMS OF AVIATION METEOROLOGY.\nSection:\nImprovements in forecast performance can be achieved by contributions from careful tunings and evaluations of current algorithms, better observations, development of new diagnostics, upgrades to underlying numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, and better observation-derived products.\nDan-Bi Lee from YSU presented the development of the G-KTG system that combines 10 CAT diagnostics and 2 MWT diagnostics using the GDAPS data. Individual diagnostics are mapped into an EDR scale, based on in situ flight observations ( Sharman and Pearson 2016 ) and GDAPS calculations of each diagnostics. The performance of the G-KTG system is evaluated against global in situ EDR observations from October 2016, and the skill score was shown to be quite good.\nJoel Tenenbaum from the State University of New York (SUNY) discussed the Global Aircraft Dataset (GADS) experiment, which was initiated by contributions from multiple international airlines for verification of winter jets. This has been updated and extended to provide automated DEVG measurements from a European-based airline and is now used for verification of current WAFS turbulence forecasts.\nSoo-Hyun Kim from YSU suggested new near-cloud turbulence (NCT) diagnostics based on the convective gravity wave drag (CGWD) parameterization by Chun and Baik (1998) . This is intended to detect NCT above convective clouds. The minimum Richardson number Rimin that includes a convective GW effect, CGWD, and turbulence kinetic energy calculated using eddy viscosity from Rimin and CGWD is suggested as possible NCT diagnostics. The case study shows that this approach is feasible to predict the NCT encounters ( Trier et al. 2012 ) above the shallow convection in cold season.\nJung-Hoon Kim from the NOAA/AWC presented results of improvements to the current MWT forecasts by reducing unphysical small-scale energy in the model topography in the initialization of the NWP model ( Park et al. 2016 ). The NWP model uses high-resolution digital elevation data interpolated to the model domain, which results in unphysical energy at scales smaller than 6 times the horizontal grid spacing (i.e., 6Δx), and this needs to be properly eliminated in the model initialization. It was found that the current regional NWP model skips this procedure, which results in an adverse high false alarm ratio for MWT prediction in the western United States. After applying smoothing functions in the NWP model, the unphysical mode in the model topography was damped and has fewer spurious, trapped mountain waves, which gives better MWT forecast skill.\nBrian Pettergrew from NOAA/AWC pointed out that improvements in the lightning data allow for better decision support with newly derived products. A lightning-based echo-top product was developed based on correlations between lightning density within a 5-km grid box and the height of maximum radar echo top. This allows a 2-min update cycle, which is higher than the 5-min current radar frequency. This can give better decision support especially for rapidly developing and decaying convection.\nLOCAL WEATHER FORECASTS AND LOW-LEVEL WIND SHEAR.\nSection:\nHigh-resolution modeling techniques with data assimilation can provide detailed structures of the local wind shear near airports. And the analysis of observed signal patterns can allow better decision support for wind shear alerts and microbursts.\nYoung-Gon Lee from KMA/National Institute of Meteorological Sciences (NIMS) developed a 300-m weather prediction model that is downscaled from 17-km GDAPS to the Incheon International Airport (IIA). Data assimilation approaches using variational methods are additionally suggested by Hee-Wook Choi from KMA/NIMS to ingest observed wind data from automatic weather stations (AWSs) and the low-level wind shear alert system (LLWAS) around IIA in a cost-effective way. Better representation of model topography in a high-resolution domain with assimilated local wind data showed potential benefits to capture detailed wind forecasts and low-level wind shear (LLWS) near the airport.\nIn-Sul Song from KMA/Aviation Meteorological Office (AMO) demonstrated rule-of-thumb signals from observation data to predict local wind shear and downbursts in rapidly changing weather conditions. A 5-yr period of Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) and LLWAS data was analyzed to find better patterns for foreseeing LLWS and microbursts at IIA. Results showed that there are four distinct patterns from TDWR: horizontally sheared type, low-level jet type, cyclonic rotation, and divergent–convergent type. Ye-Ji Park from KMA/AMO examined turbulence cases issued with AMO’s local significant weather forecast (SIGWX) based on a regionally tuned KTG system and introduced their ongoing efforts for sharing more aircraft report (AIREP) data in Korea for better situational awareness and prediction.\nBrian Pettegrew from NOAA/AWC additionally discussed the challenges and potential of new approaches for LLWS guidance and wind compression using high-resolution wind forecasts and available observational data around airports, which will be beneficial for aviation operations.\nINTERACTION BETWEEN AVIATION AND CLIMATE CHANGE.\nSection:\nBetter understandings of both the impact of climate change on aviation operations and the adverse impact of aircraft emissions and contrails on climate are important to establish a long-term strategy for green aviation in the future.\nPaul D. Williams from the University of Reading emphasized that the impacts of climate change on aviation have only recently begun to emerge (e.g., Williams and Joshi 2013 ). Here, the influence of climate change on flight routes and journey times is investigated ( Williams 2016 ), which showed that a strengthening of the prevailing winds in future climate change scenarios causes eastbound flights to shorten and westbound flights to lengthen. From a conceptual model for journey times, the eastbound shortening does not cancel out the westbound lengthening, causing an increase of the total round-trip flight time. Even assuming no future growth in aviation, this results in 2,000 h of extra journey time per year for all transatlantic flights, with an extra 7.2 million gallons of jet fuel burnt and an extra emission of 70 million kilograms of carbon dioxide.\nUlrich Schumann from the German Aerospace Center (DLR) explained how contrails from aircraft can contribute to the global warming effect. Contrails are visible aircraft tracers and indicators for aviation climate impact, which are formed when water vapor is condensed and frozen on aerosols from the exhaust of aircraft engines when the ambient air temperature is below typically −40°C ( Schumann 2012 ). Contrails also form prototype cirrus, offering insight into cirrus formation, which impacts the energy budget of the atmosphere because of a net change in radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere by reflecting incoming shortwave and trapping outgoing longwave radiation. Reduction of the climate impact of contrails is technically feasible by using biofuel, optimizing aircraft design, and developing climate-optimal flight routes. Operationally, changing a flight route to avoid areas that cause warm (cold) effects of contrails could minimize the total climate impact of aviation.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe especially thank the following sponsors for making this workshop possible: Yonsei University, National Institute of Meteorological Sciences (NIMS) in Korea, Korea Meteorological Industry Promotion Agency (KMIPA), Aviation Meteorological Office (AMO), and Korean Meteorological Administration (KMA).

The aim of this study was to evaluate methods of estimating the inhaled dose of air pollution and understand variability in the absence of a true gold standard metric. Five types of methods were identified: (1) methods using (physical) activity types, (2) methods based on energy expenditure, METs (metabolic equivalents of task), and oxygen consumption, (3) methods based on heart rate or (4) breathing rate, and (5) methods that combine heart and breathing rate. Methods were compared using a real-life data set of 122 adults who wore devices to track movement, black carbon air pollution, and physiological health markers for 3 weeks in three European cities. Different methods for estimating minute ventilation performed well in relative terms with high correlations among different methods, but in absolute terms, ignoring increased ventilation during day-to-day activities could lead to an underestimation of the daily dose by a factor of 0.08–1.78. There is no single best method, and a multitude of methods are currently being used to approximate the dose. The choice of a suitable method for determining the dose in future studies will depend on both the size and the objectives of the study.\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.est.6b05782 .\nLiterature review of minute ventilation methods, additional information as a supplement with Table 1 , full correlation and difference matrices, Bland–Altman plots for method Ve2.1, and sensitivity analyses for sex and city ( PDF )\n""","1.2677733","""http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.6b05782""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

By performing a number of simulations we investigate the major kinetic properties of the transport as a function of the network geometry, the packet input rate and the buffer size. We find long-range correlations in the power spectra of arriving packet density and the network's activity bursts. The packet transit time distribution shows a power-law dependence with average transit time increasing with network size. This implies dynamic queuing on the network, in which many interacting queues are mutually driven by temporally correlated packet streams.\nKeywords: Internet; traffic; information packet\nPACS: 02.50.cw, 05.40.-a, 89.75Hc\nCited by (38):\nDávid Csercsik , Sándor Imre .

A questionnaire designed to evaluate older people's awareness of their sensory abilities with regard to road use was administered to 80 individuals aged from 50 to 79 years, who were also given eyesight and hearing tests. Despite marked declines in their objective sensory efficiency, people in their 70s did not rate their sensory abilities as poor any more than did people in their 50s. Individuals of any age who did subjectively perceive declines in their sensory abilities also reported that they had made very sensible adjustments in their road-use behaviour, for example, avoiding complex junctions. Those individuals who reported taking such precautions also reported fewer recent accidents. One month after completing the questionnaire, and being given the results of their eyesight and hearing tests, two-thirds of individuals reported that they had made important changes in their behaviour on the roads. Many now avoided or took particular care in dangerous situations, and some had started to wear prescribed spectacles more appropriately. The implications of older people's lack of awareness of changes in their sensory abilities to their safety on the roads, and in general, are discussed. Factors causing the age-related mismatch between actual and subjectively perceived sensory abilities are discussed.\nGeneral Accident Insurance Company.

Active safety systems require precise vehicle positioning in order to assess the safety threats accurately, especially for those systems which are developed for warning/intervention in safety critical situations. When warning drivers of a local hazard (e.g. an accident site), accurate vehicle location information is important for warning the right driver groups at the right time. Global positioning system and digital maps have become major tools for vehicle positioning providing not only vehicle location information but also geometry preview of the road being used. Advances in wireless communication have made it possible for a vehicle to share its location information with other vehicles and traffic operation centres which greatly increases the opportunities to apply vehicle positioning technologies for improving road safety. This paper presents a state‐of‐the‐art review of vehicle positioning requirements for safety applications and vehicle positioning technologies. The paper also examines key issues relating to current and potential future applications of vehicle positioning technologies for improving road safety.\nArticle Metrics\n""","0.94357497","""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01441640903441531""","[-2.099122,57.165019]"

Furthermore, the tire interactions with relatively rough terrains could adversely affect the directional and roll stability limits of an ASV due to terrain-induced variations in the vertical and lateral tire forces. It may thus be desirable to assess the dynamic safety of ASVs in terms of their directional control and stability limits while operating on different terrains. The effects of terrain roughness on the directional stability limits of an ASV are investigated through simulations of a comprehensive three-dimensional model of the vehicle with and without a rear axle suspension. The model incorporates a torsio-elastic rear axle suspension, a kineto-dynamic model of the frame steering struts and equivalent random profiles of different undeformable terrains together with coherence between the two tracks profiles. The simulations are performed to determine the stability limits of the ASV models while operating on different terrains, namely: a perfectly smooth surface, plowed field, pasture, gravel road, and the MVEE random course. The directional stability limits are defined in terms of the static and dynamic rollover thresholds, rearward amplification ratio, and critical speed corresponding to snaking instability under steady and transient steering inputs. The results suggest that the tire interactions with the rough terrains affect the stability limits of both the unsuspended and suspended vehicles in a highly adverse manner. The suspended vehicle responses, however, show less sensitivity to variations in the road roughness profile.\nAlso in:\n""","0.33677945","""http://papers.sae.org/2013-01-2366/""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

With increased age and potential cognitive decline, older people take the decision to cross a street primarily based on vehicles' distance, and not on their speed. Furthermore, older pedestrians tend to overestimate their own walking speed, and could not adapt it according to the traffic conditions. Pedestrians' behavior is often tested using virtual reality. Virtual reality presents the advantage of being safe, cost-effective, and allows using standardized test conditions. METHODS: This paper describes an observational study with older and younger adults. Street crossing behavior was investigated in 18 healthy, younger and 18 older subjects by using a virtual reality setting. The aim of the study was to measure behavioral data (such as eye and head movements) and to assess how the two age groups differ in terms of number of safe street crossings, virtual crashes, and missed street crossing opportunities. Street crossing behavior, eye and head movements, in older and younger subjects, were compared with non-parametric tests. RESULTS: The results showed that younger pedestrians behaved in a more secure manner while crossing a street, as compared to older people. The eye and head movements analysis revealed that older people looked more at the ground and less at the other side of the street to cross. CONCLUSIONS: The less secure behavior in street crossing found in older pedestrians could be explained by their reduced cognitive and visual abilities, which, in turn, resulted in difficulties in the decision-making process, especially under time pressure. Decisions to cross a street are based on the distance of the oncoming cars, rather than their speed, for both groups. Older pedestrians look more at their feet, probably because of their need of more time to plan precise stepping movement and, in turn, pay less attention to the traffic. This might help to set up guidelines for improving senior pedestrians' safety, in terms of speed limits, road design, and mixed physical-cognitive trainings.\n""","0.49273664","""https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/publications/585883""",

Switched reluctance motors (SRMs) are one of promised motors for EV applications. In order to extend the EVs’ driving miles, the use of photovoltaic (PV) panels on the vehicle helps decrease the reliance on vehicle batteries. Based on phase winding characteristics of SRMs, a tri-port converter is proposed in this paper to control the energy flow between the PV panel, battery and SRM. Six operating modes are presented, four of which are developed for driving and two for standstill on-board charging. In the driving modes, the energy decoupling control for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the PV panel and speed control of the SRM are realized. In the standstill charging modes, a grid-connected charging topology is developed without a need for external hardware. When the PV panel directly charges the battery, a multi-section charging control strategy is used to optimize energy utilization. Simulation results based on Matlab/Simulink and experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed tri-port converter, which has potential economic implications to improve the market acceptance of EVs.\nDocuments\nSolar PV-Powered SRM Drive for EVs with Flexible Energy Control Functions\nRights statement: © 2015 IEEE.

But simultaneously, widespread adoption of EVs would create new challenges. For example, spatiotemporal concentration of charging events in high-density residential or commercial areas would place extreme demands on the power network, causing bottlenecks and grid instability. A novel approach to the typical decentralized control methods for EV charging service providers (CSPs) is presented. First, static price signals based on anticipated demand define a set of charging offers, targeted to segments of EV users. Prices are differentiated either only by time or both by time and place and allow comparison and evaluation of both scenarios. A choice-based revenue management method is employed to optimize allocation of generated charging offers, with respect to revenue outcome for the CSP. The charging coordination techniques are demonstrated through simulation. Data come from the London Travel Demand Survey and particularly trips around Westfield, one of Europe’s largest urban shopping malls, representing out-of-home charging behavior for short intervals in a high-demand area. Findings suggest that in a first-come, first-served system, locational pricing might create opportunities both for increased revenue and for relocation of charging events to less-congested facilities. In the revenue management system, locational pricing significantly favors total revenue outcome but without discharging vulnerable areas. However, because agents with conflicting interests participate in the process (infrastructure owners, power system operators, EV drivers), opportunity exists for the CSP to adapt constraints according to the priority of its objectives.\n< >\nTransportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board\nTransportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board\nPrint ISSN: 0361-1981\n""","1.0","""http://trrjournalonline.trb.org/doi/10.3141/2502-15""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

A road bridge is only safe if the stresses caused by the passing vehicles are less than the capacity of the bridge to resist them. Conventional SHM systems can be used to improve knowledge of the bridges capacity to resist stresses but generally give no information on the causes of any increase in stresses (based on measuring strain). The concept of in Bridge Weigh-in-Motion (B-WIM) is to establish axle loads, without interruption to traffic flow, by using strain sensors at a bridge soffit and subsequently converting the data to real time axle loads or stresses. Recent studies have shown it would be most beneficial to develop a portable system which can be easily attached to existing and new bridge structures for a specified monitoring period. The sensors could then be left in place while the data acquisition can be moved for various other sites. Therefore it is necessary to find accurate sensors capable of capturing peak strains under dynamic load and suitable methods for attaching these strain sensors to existing and new bridge structures. Additionally, it is important to ensure accurate strain transfer between concrete and steel, the adhesives layer and the strain sensor.  This paper describes research investigating the suitably of using various sensors for the monitoring of concrete structures under dynamic vehicle load. Electrical resistance strain (ERS) gauges, vibrating wire (VW) gauges and fibre optic sensors (FOS) are commonly used for SHM. A comparative study will be carried out to select a suitable sensor for a bridge Weigh in Motion System. This study will look at fixing methods, durability, scanning rate and accuracy range. Finite element modeling is used to predict the strains which are then validated in laboratory trials.\nOriginal language\n""","0.39115858","""http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/assessment-of-various-sensors-for-structural-health-monitoring-for-bridge-weighinmotion-bwim(67712075-cb0e-4242-b794-2a305d083174).html""","[-5.934759,54.583863]"
"""Imperial_College_London""","""Lung Development and Aging | Annals of the American Thoracic Society""","""Annals of the American Thoracic Society\nDepartment of Paediatrics, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom; and Royal Brompton Harefield National Health Service Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom\nCorresponding Author: Andrew Bush\nAbstract\nSection:\nThe onset of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can arise either from failure to attain the normal spirometric plateau or from an accelerated decline in lung function. Despite reports from numerous big cohorts, no single adult life factor, including smoking, accounts for this accelerated decline. By contrast, five childhood risk factors (maternal and paternal asthma, maternal smoking, childhood asthma and respiratory infections) are strongly associated with an accelerated rate of lung function decline and COPD. Among adverse effects on lung development are transgenerational (grandmaternal smoking), antenatal (exposure to tobacco and pollution), and early childhood (exposure to tobacco and pollution including pesticides) factors. Antenatal adverse events can operate by causing structural changes in the developing lung, causing low birth weight and prematurity and altered immunological responses. Also important are mode of delivery, early microbiological exposures, and multiple early atopic sensitizations. Early bronchial hyperresponsiveness, before any evidence of airway inflammation, is associated with adverse respiratory outcomes. Overlapping cohort studies established that spirometry tracks from the preschool years to late middle age, and those with COPD in the sixth decade already had the worst spirometry at age 10 years. Alveolar development is now believed to continue throughout somatic growth and is adversely impacted by early tobacco smoke exposure. Genetic factors are also important, with genes important in lung development and early wheezing also being implicated in COPD. The inescapable conclusion is that the roots of COPD are in early life, and COPD is a disease of childhood adverse factors interacting with genetic factors.\nKeywords:\nKeywords: atopy ; asthma ; nicotine ; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ; microbiome\nIn 1977, in a classic report, Fletcher and Peto ( 1 ) proposed a model (their Figure 1 ) in which all comers attained a normal FEV1 at age 25 years, and progression to respiratory disability was solely determined by rate of decline of spirometry thereafter. Smoking history was seen as the chief determinant of rate of decline, and events before age 25 years were irrelevant. In their far less well known, but far more accurate Figure 2, they incorporated different starting levels of FEV1 at age 25 years, as well as different rates of decline, into their model. These findings have been taken forward and have had to be substantially modified by a recent study combining three cohorts. This confirmed two trajectories to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or, strictly speaking, to an FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 70%. There were approximately equal numbers in each trajectory. Of those who failed to attain an FEV1 of 80% before age 40 years, 26% had developed COPD during the 22 years of observation, whereas 7% with a normal FEV1 aged 40 years developed COPD within the same time period due to an accelerated rate of decline in FEV1 ( 2 ). Critically, the rate of decline was unrelated to smoking, nor could the authors identify any current feature associated with rapid decline in spirometry. The only logical conclusion is that all COPD risk is determined before the age of 40 years, either genetically or by environmental adverse influences or their interactions ( Figure 1 ).\nFigure 1. Why adults get premature airway disease. Note that all the factors have origins in childhood; there is no consistent adult-onset feature identified in the literature.\n[More] [Minimize]\nThis conclusion is supported by a European study that identified five adverse childhood influences that were associated with a lower FEV1 and a more rapid rate of decline of spirometry (and, hence, a greater COPD risk in adult life) ( 3 ). These were maternal and paternal asthma, maternal smoking, and childhood asthma and severe respiratory infections. Childhood disadvantage was at least as important as heavy smoking. The focus is therefore on any adverse event increasing the likelihood of one or more of these disadvantages. The first lesson from normal lung growth for pediatricians is that by asking five simple questions (antenatally, asking the mother three simple questions) ( Table 1 ) ( 4 ), a population of children at high risk for later premature airflow obstruction can be identified. Second, any factor increasing the likelihood of the development of childhood asthma or an increased propensity to respiratory infection will contribute to accelerated lung aging. Gene polymorphisms, for example in a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 33 (ADAM33), have also been associated with accelerated decline in lung function ( 5 ) (see below). Finally, no adult life influence, including smoking, has consistently been associated with accelerated decline in spirometry. The conclusion is inescapable: both the two recently described trajectories to COPD ( 2 ) are determined before adult life, and, if COPD is to be prevented, measures starting in adult life are too late.\nTable 1. Simple key questions to identify children at high risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nAntenatally and postnatally\nDoes the child have asthma?\nHas the child had severe respiratory infections?\nThe best description of the normal evolution of spirometry is from the Global Lung Initiative ( 6 ). The group used 97,759 measurements in healthy nonsmokers from 72 centers in 33 countries aged between 2.5 and 95 years to construct predictive equations for spirometry. From their smooth curves, three key stages emerge: for normal lung health, spirometry needs to be normal at first measurement (now best described by the raised volume, rapid thoracic compression technique at birth [ 7 ], or preschool standard spirometry [ 8 ], stage 1), needs to grow normally in childhood to attain a normal plateau at age 20 to 25 years (stage 2), and declines with aging at a normal rate (stage 3). Key influences on these stages are discussed in turn. Finally, new data challenging the concepts of normal alveolar growth are presented. Space allows only a summary of many factors leading to childhood asthma and respiratory infections.\nKey Stage 1: Before Birth\nSection:\nThe morphological phases of lung development in utero have been well described; airway caliber is determined largely in the second half of pregnancy. Recently, the gene expression studies of normal lung development have been determined ( 9 ) and have broadly confirmed the utility of the morphological stages. The complexities of the pathways of branching morphogenesis have been reviewed ( 10 , 11 ) and will not be discussed further, except insofar as they lead to important genetic clues into lung aging.\nPreconception adverse events may impact the fetus. Grandmaternal smoking has a double-hit effect; it increases the risk of maternal asthma and, even if the mother herself does not smoke, increases the risk of her offspring having asthma ( 12 , 13 ).\nAntenatal adverse effects can be mediated through reducing airway caliber, altering fetal immune responses, inducing either or both prematurity and low birth weight, and influencing the mode of delivery. Many different antenatal adverse effects on lung growth have been described ( 14 ), including the effects of maternal stress on fetal immune responses ( 15 ), but most information is available for nicotine and tobacco smoke. These are worsened if mother or fetus have non-null GSTT1, highlighting the importance of gene–environment interactions ( 16 ). Recently, the adverse effects on early childhood spirometry of maternal exposure to environmental pollution have come to the fore ( 17 , 18 ), and, although the mechanisms are speculative, it is clear that early airflow obstruction is the result ( 19 ).\nMaternal hypertension of pregnancy has been described as causing airflow obstruction in the baby ( 20 ), but this has been disputed recently, with attention focusing on prepregnancy hypertension as being important ( 21 ). More studies are needed to confirm or otherwise the developmental role of maternal blood pressure on the baby.\nStructural Changes\nMost of the data have come from animal models of nicotine exposure of the pregnant dam. Antenatal changes described include increased collagen deposition ( 22 ), increased MUC5AC expression ( 23 ), and airway lengthening and reduction in caliber ( 24 ). The readout in the fetus is airway obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) at birth. Note that AHR occurs in the absence of allergen exposure (mice) and any evidence of airway inflammation (mice, infants [ 24 , 25 ]). The anatomical changes are likely also exacerbated by loss of alveolar tethering points ( 26 ) and increased airway smooth muscle thickness ( 27 )\nImmunological Changes\nThere are a large number of studies looking at the effects of pregnancy exposures on cord blood mononuclear cell function. Maternal smoking and previous pregnancies affect cord blood mononuclear cell proliferation to allergens ( 28 ). Abnormal cytokine responses at birth predict wheeze with viral infections in early life ( 29 ), including rhinovirus-induced wheeze, which is strongly associated with subsequent asthma ( 30 ). Maternal smoking is also associated with abnormal toll-like receptor function ( 31 ).\nBirth Weight, Low Birth Weight, and Prematurity\nA recent metaanalysis has shown that any cause of low birth weight is associated with subsequent childhood and adult asthma ( 32 ). The Aberdeen Birth cohort demonstrated a linear relationship between birth weight (adjusted for relevant maternal factors) and spirometry at age 45 to 50 years ( 33 ). Tobacco smoking is a well-known cause of preterm delivery, the risk of which is reduced by tobacco legislation ( 34 ). Very preterm infants are well known to be left with fixed and variable airflow obstruction, and, although outcomes are improving ( 35 ), even those preterm babies requiring no treatment in the newborn period have airflow limitation ( 36 ), so improvements in neonatal intensive care are unlikely to abolish the problem. The decrements in spirometry in bronchopulmonary dysplasia survivors are greater than those of healthy preterm infants ( 37 ). Furthermore, even modest degrees of prematurity (up to 37 weeks’ gestation) are associated with impaired spirometry in the late teenage years ( 38 ) and increased use of asthma medications in childhood ( 39 – 41 ). Low birth weight of itself is a risk factor for subsequent asthma ( 32 ). There may be a differential effect of low birth weight in babies who are small (SGA), as opposed to appropriate (AGA), weight for gestation age; at age 20 to 22 years, spirometry was strongly predicted by birth weight in the SGA but not the AGA group ( 42 ). It should be noted that, as protocols for resuscitation of the newborn ( 43 ) and subsequent ventilation ( 44 ) have changed, so have the different contributions of airway and parenchymal disease in “new” and “old” bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( 45 )\nMode of Delivery\nDelivery by caesarean section is associated with an increased risk of atopic disorders ( 46 , 47 ), probably mediated via an effect on the fetal microbiome ( 48 ). Especially if at least one parent is allergic, children delivered by caesarean section have a higher prevalence of asthma at age 8 years, and children of nonallergic parents were more likely to be sensitized ( 49 ). Because there are no randomized controlled trials of caesarean section delivery, it is not possible to disentangle the effects of caesarean delivery from the causes leading to the need for caesarean delivery.\nKey Stage 2: Childhood Lung Growth\nSection:\nLessons from the Birth Cohorts\nThe ideal study would have recruited babies antenatally and followed them through with repeated measurements until death; such a study has not been done, and so we have to rely on a series of overlapping cohorts ( 50 – 53 ), reviewed in Reference 54 . Although there are some discrepancies, the general message is that lung function at age 4 to 6 years is determined by lung function and bronchial hyperresponsiveness soon after birth, and thereafter tracks; hence, decrements at age 4 to 6 years are reflected in adult lung function, at least to age 50 years. There may be further deterioration at school age and beyond, but no improvements.\nThis view has recently been challenged, at least in the context of preterm survivors. A group of preterm babies at age 7 to 9 years had evidence of airflow obstruction, the degree of which related to the intensity of neonatal treatment, but this had normalized by age 20 to 22 years ( 42 ); interestingly, birth weight was a strong determinant of airflow obstruction in the SGA but not the AGA low birth weight babies. However, this difference was not found in another study ( 55 ). The differences might relate to the proportions of SGA and AGA babies in the different studies or the relative insensitivity of spirometry to distal airway disease. Overall, however, it is clear that the preschool years represent a critical window for long-term lung health.\nThe presence of AHR is important in long-term lung function and requires a developmental perspective. Three groups have measured neonatal AHR, and all showed significant relationships with long-term outcomes, albeit with slightly different results ( 56 – 60 ). The COPSAC (Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood) data ( 59 ) suggested that 40% of airway obstruction at age 7 years was determined antenatally and 60% postnatally; neonatal AHR was more strongly associated with asthma at age 7 years than neonatal lung function. It should be noted that neonatal AHR is not related to airway inflammation ( 25 ) and is presumably determined by anatomical factors (see above); thus, small airways increase resistance more for a given proportionate radius change because resistance is inversely related to the fourth power of the radius. Although AHR and lung function at birth were described as independent risk factors for childhood lung function ( 61 ), in reality abnormal anatomy is likely to underlie both. Finally, the longest-running study of AHR from birth to adult life showed that the adult relationship between AHR and asthma was established before age 6 years ( 62 ).\nTobacco and Nicotine\nThe effects of passive smoking were described in a series of metaanalyses ( 63 – 69 ), which have been recently updated ( 70 ); they are sufficiently well known that, in the interest of space, they will not be further discussed. Of interest, recent data showed that maternal smoking and the child taking up smoking have additive effects on the child’s lung function ( 71 ).\nPollution\nThe association of exposure to outdoor pollution postnatally with poorer lung function, asthma, respiratory infections, and a lower rate of growth of spirometry has been well described ( 72 – 74 ), but it may be difficult to disentangle the confounding effects of socioeconomic status. Recently, the beneficial effects of legislation leading to improved air quality on the growth of children’s lungs have been described ( 2 ). Globally, indoor exposure to burning biomass fuels may be most important, and measures to improve indoor air quality improve children’s lung function ( 75 ). Organophosphorus pesticides have recently been implicated as affecting child lung development ( 76 ).\nAsthma and Atopy\nEarly impairment of lung function is associated with objectively diagnosed asthma at age 10 years ( 77 ). It has long been known that early sensitization to aeroallergens is associated with persistent wheeze, loss of lung function, and the development of AHR ( 78 ). Understanding has advanced with the realization that atopy is not an all-or-none phenomenon but can be quantified ( 79 ) and has a developmental perspective. The Manchester group used machine learning approaches to analyze data on patterns of wheeze and atopic sensitization and showed that only multiple early sensitizations were important ( 80 ). In a subsequent study, they showed that persistent wheeze, early multiple atopic sensitizations, and asthma attacks are associated with reduced growth in lung function ( 81 ). Asthma itself is associated with poorer lung growth. As yet unexplained, in the CAMP (Childhood Asthma Management Program) study, approximately one-third of subjects lost percent predicted lung function over the study period, independent of prescribed treatment ( 82 ).\nEarly Viral Infections\nThat acute viral infections are important causes of early respiratory morbidity due to bronchiolitis and wheeze is indisputable. However, whether they cause asthma to develop in an infant who would otherwise not go on to the disease, or are a marker for an asthma propensity, or both, is controversial. It is clear from cord blood studies (see above) that there is antenatal programming favoring viral wheeze; a study from Perth showed that respiratory function was impaired before the development of bronchiolitis, and this decrement tracked into mid-childhood ( 83 ). Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis is a devastating illness, but studies as to whether it is causally associated with asthma are controversial ( 84 , 85 ). Recently, attention has focused on rhinovirus as being more associated with later asthma ( 30 ). The balance of evidence is that allergic sensitization precedes viral wheezing ( 86 ), and it is likely that sensitization rather than viral infections drive the march to asthma. However, this conclusion must still be considered tentative.\nMicrobiome\nThe role of bacteria in normal and abnormal immune development, as well as exacerbations of airway disease ( 87 ), has recently come to the fore. The lower airway is now known not to be sterile as was once believed ( 88 ). Early nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization is associated with altered immune responses ( 89 ), a greater likelihood of wheezing ( 90 ), and worse respiratory infective outcomes ( 91 )—therefore, a double hit at least hypothetically in accelerating lung aging subsequently. It is likely that the fundamental abnormality is an underlying mucosal immune defect, but this is still contentious. By contrast, environmental bacterial and fungal diversity is associated with a reduced risk of asthma ( 92 ). Animal studies have shown that the microbiome is essential for normal immune development ( 93 ), and interactions between allergens and the microbiome influence the body’s immune responses ( 94 , 95 ). The long-term effects of an abnormal microbiome on lung aging are currently unknown, but their influences on asthma risk mean that they are likely significant (see above).\nNutrition\nThere is evidence that an early and rapid gain in weight may be associated with poorer lung growth, in addition to the effects of low birth weight and SGA ( 96 ). However, paradoxically, greater weight gain in later childhood may be associated with better spirometry ( 97 ).\nKey Stage 3: The Aging Lung\nSection:\nThere has been much recent information that has increased our understanding of lung aging since Fletcher and Peto’s manuscript ( 2 , 98 – 101 ). In summary, it is clear that many patients with COPD have a normal rate of lung aging, and, indeed, those who fail to attain the normal plateau in early adult life are at the highest risk of COPD. Asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness are risk factors for accelerated decline, but no other environmental factor, including smoking, has consistently been implicated as a cause. The Framingham study reported traffic pollution as being important ( 102 ), but the caveats about socioeconomic status (see above) remain.\nThe role of asthma and AHR in accelerated decline in airway function is multifactorial. The combination of a preexisting low FEV1 and airway inflammation (as shown by elevation in fractional exhaled nitric oxide) is associated with accelerated decline ( 103 ), as are asthma attacks ( 104 ). The Groningen group showed that patients with asthma who stopped smoking and used inhaled corticosteroids had a slower rate of decline; AHR predicted decline independent of baseline FEV1 ( 105 ). However, the two are interrelated; they also showed that low childhood FEV1 and less increase over time was associated with adult AHR ( 106 )\nGenes, Lung Growth, and Lung Aging\nSection:\nGenetic factors, including gene-by-environment interactions via a variety of epigenetic mechanisms, are clearly important in lung development and aging. It is likely that a rich harvest of COPD genes will be found in normal lung development ( 107 ). There are substantial commonalities between genes causing reduced lung function in both smokers and nonsmokers ( 108 ). The conventional approaches have recently been taken forward by using systems genetic approaches ( 109 ).\nAntenatally Important Genes\nADAM33 is an exemplar gene with different roles at different developmental stages. It is important antenatally during airway branching morphogenesis ( 110 ). Levels in the fetus depend on maternal atopy, via an IL-13 pathway ( 111 ). There is an adverse interaction between antenatal tobacco exposure and ADAM33 polymorphisms and lung function at age 8 years ( 112 ). ADAM33 polymorphisms are associated with increased airway resistance in the preschool years ( 113 ), are associated with asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in adults ( 114 ), and those known to convey susceptibility to COPD were associated with an accelerated rate of decline in spirometry in a Dutch general population ( 5 ).\nGenes Important in Early Postnatal Life\nThe β-receptor gene links early lung function, asthma, and COPD. Much is known about β-receptor function in asthma, but very little is known about any possible role in infancy. Maximal flow at functional residual capacity and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) were measured soon after birth in infants; having any Glyn 27 or Arg 16 allele was associated with reduced maximal flow at functional residual capacity ( 1 ), independent of maternal smoking or atopic status, but BHR was independent of genotype. The patients were restudied at age 11 years, and β-receptor genotype had no association with either spirometry or BHR, possibly because of low statistical power. More than 80% of the children had at least one parent with asthma, so caution should be exercised before extrapolating to low-risk populations. In another study ( 115 ) there was an association between arg16 gln27 and a positive BHR at age 6 years. The gly16 gln27 haplotype was associated with better spirometry at 6 and 11 years of age and less likelihood of an asthma diagnosis at the later time point, but at age 11 years, arg16 gln27 was associated with worse spirometry. A further study found associations with β-receptor haplotypes in adults with COPD, asthma, and other respiratory problems ( 116 ). β-receptor polymorphisms also predicted symptoms of asthma continuing into adult life ( 117 ), but like other genetic studies, the association was weak. One study examined the genetics of preschool wheeze phenotypes and related them to COPD genes ( 118 ). They found that at least three COPD genes were involved in lung growth and development and were involved in antenatal and early life responses to tobacco smoke exposure. More recently, low circulating concentrations of the antiinflammatory protein CC16, which are known to be associated with an accelerated decline in FEV1 in patients with COPD ( 98 , 119 ), have also been found to be associated with accelerated decline in a general adult population and impaired childhood lung function ( 120 ).\nGenome-Wide Association Studies of Spirometry: Developmental Genes\nThere have been a large number of recent important genome-wide association studies both of normal lung function ( 121 – 123 ) and of COPD, many but not all of the latter focusing on lung function ( 122 – 126 ). A recent genome-wide association study implicated the CHRNA5/3 region and in particular HTR4 in airflow obstruction ( 127 ). At least some of the genes identified are also active in important in utero developmental pathways (e.g., wnt/β-catenin [ 128 ]). However, other genes important in premature onset of adult COPD ( 129 ), such as alpha-1 antitrypsin, appear not to have a developmental role, although interestingly those heterozygous for mutations in this gene appear to have increased respiratory reserve ( 130 )\nAlveolar Growth\nSection:\nConventional wisdom was that alveolar growth was largely a postnatal phenomenon, with an initial rapid phase in the first 2 years of life and a much slower phase until age 8 years, whereupon alveoli increased in size but not in number. A series of recent papers have challenged this concept. In nonhuman primates, where alveolar counts can be made at different ages, alveolar numbers increase until adult maturity. In humans, inhalation of hyperpolarized helium (He3) can be used to calculate alveolar size using a number of mathematical modeling techniques and has demonstrated that alveolar size does not change between the ages of 7 and 21 years ( 131 ).\nAdverse effects on alveolar growth have really only been studied in the context of prematurity and its treatment. In animal models, hyperoxia, systemic steroids, and nicotine all impair secondary septation and neoalveolarization ( 132 – 134 ). He3 data in humans ( 135 ) suggest that maternal smoking in pregnancy may increase alveolar size and reduce numbers. The fact that nicotine itself is implicated in both impaired airway and alveolar development calls into question the safety of e-cigarettes ( 136 ). There is also some evidence of catch-up growth, although this is based on cross-sectional studies, not longitudinal data; there are no neonatal data with corresponding studies in childhood and adult life. One group used carbon monoxide transfer as a surrogate for the size of the alveolar–capillary membrane and showed this was normal at rest and on exercise in adult life ( 137 ). He3 data in preterm survivors in adolescence showed that alveolar size was normal ( 138 ). Nitrogen washout can be used to partition gas mixing abnormalities into airway (Scond) and alveolar (Sacin) ( 139 , 140 ). Compared with normal infants, preterm survivors in childhood had, as expected, an abnormal Scond, but Sacin was normal, implying normal alveolarization ( 141 ). However, it should be said that if many alveoli were completely destroyed, Sacin would still be normal, because they would give no signal. Also, all these studies assumed that alveolarization had been abnormal in the newborn period, but they could not measure it, so that there had been true catch-up growth remains conjectural. However, taken together, the evidence is that alveolarization continues for longer, and there is greater potential for catch-up growth, than was previously believed. Certainly, lungs apparently destroyed by necrotizing pneumonias usually recover completely ( 142 ), so at least the potential for catch-up is certainly present. Intriguingly, being brought up at altitude in hypoxic conditions appears to stimulate alveolarization while having no effect on airway function ( 143 ); this raises the intriguing question as to whether keeping the preterm survivors very well oxygenated is as wise as we believed.\nCOPD: Relevance of Developmental Aspects of Lung Function\nSection:\nThere is one final lesson to be learned from developmental aspects of lung growth. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease defines COPD as an FEV1/FVC ratio less than 70%. However, this ratio changes with age ( 144 ); the lungs of young children empty so efficiently that the forced expiratory volume in 0.5 second (FEV0.5)/FVC ratio has to be used ( 7 ), because FEV1/FVC is 100%. Conversely, after age 50 years, increasing numbers of normal people will have FEV1/FVC ratio less than 70%, and after age 70 years, more than 15% of normal people will have FEV1/FVC ratio less than 70%. This use of a fixed ratio without considering the developmental background has two important consequences. The first is that many more normal elderly people will be diagnosed as having COPD ( 145 ). The second is that the severity of the premature airflow obstruction in young adults and even children will not be appreciated; an FEV1/FVC ratio of 75% will be very abnormal at this age. This underscores the fact that premature airflow obstruction is primarily a pediatric disease; this is being overlooked, and intervention delayed, by relying on a ratio that is falsely reassuring at a young age.\nSummary and Conclusions: What Does This Mean for the Future of Lung Health?\nSection:\nIt is clear that if we are to prevent COPD from becoming an ever more important cause of death in adults, we must optimize lung health from before birth and in early childhood. We have much to learn about detailed mechanisms, but there is much we can do now while these studies are going on. We must focus on three preventive measures that have been shown to work. As a matter of urgency, we need to tighten our grip on all forms of tobacco and nicotine exposure, including e-cigarettes. We must legislate to reduce exposure to outdoor pollution, in particular ensuring that very tight controls on vehicle emissions in residential areas are enforced. We need to acknowledge that healthy aging starts in childhood, and unhealthy aging does as well. If fundamental research in the prevention of COPD is to be done, it will be done in early life. Finally, in particular in low- and middle-income country settings, we must ensure that indoor biomass fuel exposure is minimized. The message needs to be gotten across that COPD is not all about a disease that smokers bring on themselves but is in fact just disease of childhood disadvantage and genetics, which must be addressed in childhood if death rates are to drop.\nReferences\n""","0.11367707","""https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201602-112AW""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

These two scheduling problems are commonly formulated with non-smooth cost functions respectively considering various effects and constraints, such as the valve point effect, power balance and ramp rate limits. The expected increase in plug-in electric vehicles is likely to see a significant impact on the power system due to high charging power consumption and significant uncertainty in charging times. In this paper, multiple electric vehicle charging profiles are comparatively integrated into a 24-hour load demand in an economic and environment dispatch model. Self-learning teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO) is employed to solve the non-convex non-linear dispatch problems. Numerical results on well-known benchmark functions, as well as test systems with different scales of generation units show the significance of the new scheduling method.\nDocuments\nA self-learning TLBO based dynamic economic/environmental dispatch considering multiple plug-in electric vehicle loads\nRights statement: Copyright The Author(s) 2014.

NEJM ( 1 )\nReviewed by Sabi Hippolyte\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is due to genetic mutations resulting in deficient or dysfunctional CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Phe508del is the most common mutation, leading to protein misfolding and failure of trafficking to the cell surface; approximately 45% of the global CF population is homozygous for this mutation. Lumacaftor is a CFTR corrector (increasing the amount of protein localized to the cell surface). Ivacaftor is an approved CFTR potentiator (increasing the duration for which CFTR channels are open). In combination, there is a suggestion that CFTR activity can be increased sufficiently to improve clinical outcomes for Phe508del CFTR mutation homozygotes ( 2 ).\nThese two virtually identical phase 3 trials (TRAFFIC [A Study of Lumacaftor in Combination with Ivacaftor in Cystic Fibrosis Subjects Aged 12 Years and Older Who Are Homozygous for the F508del-CFTR Mutation] and TRANSPORT [A Study of Lumacaftor in Combination with Ivacaftor in Cystic Fibrosis Subjects Aged 12 Years and Older Who Are Homozygous for the F508del-CFTR Mutation]) were multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral lumacaftor/ivacaftor in combination for homozygous Phe508del mutation patients with CF of 12 years of age or older with FEV1 40–90% predicted at screening. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to: 600 mg lumacaftor once daily/250 mg ivacaftor twice daily (bd); 400 mg lumacaftor bd/250 mg ivacaftor bd; or placebo bd. A total of 1,122 were randomized, 559 in TRAFFIC, 563 in TRANSPORT.\nThe primary end point was absolute change from baseline at Week 24 in FEV1%. Secondary end points included the absolute change in body mass index (BMI) and patient-reported CF Questionnaire–Revised respiratory domain scores and the number of pulmonary exacerbations.\nThe groups were well matched at baseline with a mean FEV1 of 61% predicted, mean BMI of 21 kg/m2, mean age of 25 years, and similar rates of standard CF therapies. A significant treatment effect was seen for FEV1 in both active arms versus placebo (absolute difference, 2.6–4%, P < 0.001; relative difference, 4.3–6.7%, P < 0.001).\nThe rate ratio of pulmonary exacerbations was significantly different, with pooled analysis showing a 39% lower exacerbation rate in the 400 mg bd lumacaftor group and a 30% reduced rate in the 600 mg once daily lumacaftor group compared with placebo (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively).\nAt Week 24, the pooled analysis showed an absolute change in BMI of 0.24–0.28 kg/m2 (P < 0.001) in treatment versus placebo (although the TRAFFIC study alone did not show a significant difference in BMI change). Despite numerical increases in CF Questionnaire–Revised respiratory domain score, this was only significant in the 600 mg/d lumacaftor group and did not reach the clinically important threshold of a 4-point difference.\nAdverse events were similar across treatment (17.3–22.8%) and placebo (28.6%) arms. The percentage of patients who discontinued the study because of an adverse event was 1.6% in the placebo arm versus 4.2% in treatment groups. In the treatment groups, discontinuation was due to elevated creatinine kinase, hemoptysis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pulmonary exacerbation, or rash. Adverse events were largely respiratory (bronchospasm/dyspnea), and in those who did not discontinue the study, symptoms resolved within 2–3 weeks; the frequency of this was higher in the treated groups, although the mechanism underlying it remains unclear. A total of 5.1% placebo and 5.2% treatment groups had elevation of transaminases by more than three times the upper limit of normal. However, this was only classed as severe in the treatment group, of which six out of seven returned to baseline on discontinuing or interrupting treatment.\nThe clinical benefit for lumacaftor–ivacaftor in combination is greater than that previously observed with either agent alone and was sustained for the duration of the studies. The dose regimens had similar efficacy and safety profiles. However, although these trials offer an encouraging proof of principle, the benefits in terms of lung function are more modest than those seen for ivacaftor alone in class III mutations. It is hoped, although not yet demonstrated in this group, that CFTR modulation will also slow the rate of decline of lung function. Given the association between chronic loss of lung function and exacerbation frequency, the reduction in the latter in these trials is promising and may increase the impact of the therapy in the longer term.\nReferences\n1.\nWainwright CE, Elborn JS, Ramsey BW, Marigowda G, Huang X, Cipolli M, Colombo C, Davies JC, De Boeck K, Flume PA, et al.; TRAFFIC Study Group; TRANSPORT Study Group.

A Randomized Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Phase 2 Trial of BIIL 284 BS (an LTB4 Receptor Antagonist) for the Treatment of Lung Disease in Children and Adults with Cystic Fibrosis. J Cyst Fibros ( 3 )\nReviewed by Rishi Pabary\nA hallmark of CF lung disease is persistent neutrophilic inflammation, triggered by successive bacterial infections, that leads to irreversible parenchymal destruction ( 4 ). Antiinflammatory strategies have previously been studied and, although long-term treatment with ibuprofen has been shown to slow disease progression in CF, it is not widely prescribed because of concerns about systemic side effects ( 5 ). Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant produced in response to stimuli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection; high levels are found in CF sputum and correlate with decline in lung function ( 6 ), so blockade could theoretically improve clinical outcomes.\nTo determine the therapeutic potential of oral BIIL 284 BS, an LTB4 receptor antagonist, Konstan and colleagues ( 3 ) conducted a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with CF aged 6 years or older with FEV1 between 25 and 85% of predicted values or FEV1 greater than 85% and current P. aeruginosa infection. All patients were defined as clinically stable in the 4 weeks before screening. Exclusion criteria were chronic Burkholderia infection and long-term treatment with systemic corticosteroids or high-dose ibuprofen. Patients were randomized to BIIL 284 BS or placebo and followed every 28 days for 24 weeks. Primary end points were change in FEV1% predicted and number of pulmonary exacerbations. Online safety data were monitored throughout the trial.\nBased on power of over 90% to detect 3% change in FEV1, enrollment of 600 patients was planned; however, the trial was halted early by the CF Foundation Data Safety Monitoring Board after a planned interim analysis, which revealed an increased frequency of respiratory serious adverse events in adults on active treatment compared with placebo controls (29.7 vs. 11.8%, P = 0.001); a similar, but nonsignificant, trend was also seen in pediatric patients. In final analysis, pulmonary exacerbations were higher in adults on the study drug (33.1 vs. 18.2%, P = 0.005) with a significant difference in Kaplan-Meier curves for time to exacerbation between treatment groups (P = 0.002). Clinical efficacy could not be fully assessed owing to early termination, but there was a trend toward poorer average FEV1 in both adults and children receiving BILI 284 BS compared with placebo.\nSafety and modest efficacy of BIIL 284 BS has previously been reported in human trials of patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( 7 ), and reduction of neutrophilic inflammation by targeting LTB4 has been demonstrated in animal models of P. aeruginosa infection ( 8 ). However, reducing neutrophil activity in the CF lung by blockade of LTB4 receptors may facilitate bacterial proliferation. This was subsequently shown in a murine study in which animals infected with P. aeruginosa and treated with BIIL 284 BS had higher bacteraemia rates and pulmonary proinflammatory cytokine concentrations compared with those receiving placebo ( 9 ); the paradoxical rise in peripheral neutrophil counts that accompanied increased respiratory exacerbations in adults taking BIIL 284 BS compared with placebo in this study could be interpreted as an analog of this response.\nThe results of this trial highlight a potential pitfall in suppressing inflammatory responses in patients with a background of chronic infection; whereas insufficient antiinflammatory activity may render an agent ineffective, too potent a response may lead to infection-related safety concerns. The rigor demonstrated in the ongoing data collection, which allowed prompt recognition of this concern, underlines the importance of robust safety monitoring in clinical drug trials.\nReferences\n3.\nKonstan MW, Döring G, Heltshe SL, Lands LC, Hilliard KA, Koker P, Bhattacharya S, Staab A, Hamilton A; Investigators and Coordinators of BI Trial 543.45.

Lancet Respir Med ( 10 )\nReviewed by Michael Waller\nNonsense (class I) CFTR mutations are present in 10% of patients with CF and associated with severe CF lung disease. They are characterized by premature mRNA translational stop codons and result in truncated, nonfunctional CFTR protein with complete absence in the cell membrane. Ataluren is an oral, nonaminoglycoside compound, which allows ribosomal readthrough, thus producing a full-length, functional CFTR protein. Previous trials have demonstrated CFTR correction in vitro and with electrophysiological measures in a phase 2 clinical trial; small changes in lung function were also seen ( 11 , 12 ).\nThis well-designed multicenter, double-blind study randomized 238 patients (>6 yr with at least one nonsense mutation, and an FEV1% predicted 40–90%) to 48 weeks of ataluren or placebo (1:1). The primary end point was the relative change in FEV1% predicted from baseline; in vivo assessments of CFTR function (nasal potential difference and pilocarpine iontophoresis) were also performed.\nAt baseline, treatment groups were well matched, with a mean age of around 23 years and FEV1% predicted of 60–62%. At Week 48, a nonsignificant (P = 0.12) treatment effect was seen, with a mean difference in relative change FEV1 of 2.5% favoring ataluren treatment (ataluren, −2.53 vs. placebo, −5.50). No significant difference in the mean number of pulmonary exacerbations while on treatment was identified (ataluren, 1.42 vs. placebo, 1.78). No difference in CFTR-mediated chloride secretion from sweat or measured via nasal potential difference was seen between the two groups. Both treatment groups had a similar safety profile, other than increased serum creatinine concentrations occurring in 15% of the ataluren group, the most severe of which were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic antibiotics.\nIn a post hoc analysis, subgroups of patients receiving or not receiving long-term inhaled tobramycin (to treat chronic P. aeruginosa infection) were compared. Those not receiving inhaled tobramycin demonstrated a treatment difference of FEV1% predicted of 5.7% in favor of ataluren (ataluren, −0.7 vs. placebo, −6.4; P = 0.0082) and a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations (ataluren, 1.42 vs. placebo, 2.18; P = 0.018)); by contrast, no difference was observed in patients taking long-term tobramycin. Other inhaled antibiotics did not modify the effect on ataluren.\nThe authors performed post hoc in vitro assays and demonstrated that ataluren-induced readthrough of stop codons was reduced in the presence of tobramycin. As tobramycin acts through ribosomal binding, there is likely interaction with the ribosomal modulation mechanism of ataluren, thus abolishing its action.\nAlthough the trial failed to reach its primary end point or demonstrate key clinical improvements in the group as a whole, it is encouraging to see promising results from the tobramycin-naive subgroup. A phase 3 trial of ataluren in patients not receiving chronic inhaled tobramycin is currently in progress (clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov [NCT02139306]) to ascertain clinical benefit and establish disease modification. An interesting point regarding polypharmacy, so common in CF, is raised by this trial. Although clinical teams and trials themselves are often designed to detect safety issues related to interacting drugs or those with similar toxicity profiles, the impact of one drug on the efficacy of another has been less commonly studied. The recent publication by Nick and colleagues ( 13 ), reporting a similar issue in patients receiving long-term macrolide therapy, in whom the beneficial effect of nebulized tobramycin was abrogated, underscores the importance of such complex interactions, which will become increasingly common with the continued development of new therapies.\nReferences\n""","0.41103524","""https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1164/rccm.201509-1734RR""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

Notch signalling has been extensively linked to breast cancer especially in patients who fail to respond to endocrine therapy. Following activation, Notch intracellular domain is released and enters the nucleus where activates transcription of target genes. The numerous steps that cascade after activation of the receptor complicate using Notch as biomarker. Hence, this warrants the development of reliable indicators of Notch activity. DMXL2 is a novel regulator of Notch signalling not yet investigated in breast cancer. Here, we demonstrate that DMXL2 is overexpressed in a subset of endocrine therapy resistant breast cancer cell lines where it promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition through hyper-activation of Notch signalling via V-ATPase dependent acidification. Following DMXL2 depletion or treatment with Bafilomycin A1, both EMT targets and Notch signalling pathway significantly decrease. We show for the first time that DMXL2 protein levels are significantly increased in ERα positive breast cancer patients that progress after endocrine therapy. Finally, we demonstrate that DMXL2 is a transmembrane protein with a potential extra-cellular domain. These findings identify DMXL2 as a novel, functional biomarker for ERα positive breast cancer.\nDMXL2 drives epithelial to mesenchymal transition in hormonal therapy resistant breast cancer through Notch hyper-activation | Faronato | Oncotarget\nINTRODUCTION\nNotch signalling is frequently deregulated in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer and represents a challenging but important therapeutic opportunity [ 1 ]. At least in some respect, difficulties in targeting Notch arise from the complex molecular features of this pathway [ 2 ]. In mammals, there are four Notch receptors and five Notch ligands. The activity of both is regulated by endocytic trafficking, although the detailed mechanisms are yet to be fully defined [ 3 ]. Data suggest that defective endosomes maturation could cause aberrant Notch signalling by interfering with γ-secretase (GS) mediated Notch cleavage [ 4 ]. At present, Notch can be targeted in the clinic with γ-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a series of compounds designed to block Notch cleavage and nuclear translocation of Notch intracellular domain. Furthermore, antibodies against Notch are currently being tested [ 5 ] although patients reported side effects similar to the ones due to the use of GSIs [ 6 ]. Notch plays a pivotal role in many processes including embryonic development, carcinogenesis, cancer stem cells maintenance, angiogenesis, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) [ 7 – 13 ].\nAberrant Notch signalling has been linked to breast cancer formation and progression [ 14 ]. Breast cancer remains a major clinical problem worldwide, accounting for over for 23% of all cancer deaths [ 15 ]. Nearly 70% of breast cancers express estrogen receptor α (ERα) and are treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy designed to block ERα driven transcriptional programs. Alas, around 40% of patients evolve resistance to endocrine therapies and progress towards more advanced disease [ 16 – 18 ]. The mechanisms behind drug resistance have not yet been fully elucidated, although work from our and other groups proposes that epigenetic reprogramming leading to increased Notch signalling may contribute to it [ 19 – 21 ]. Notch involvement in endocrine therapy resistance makes it attractive for developing targeted therapies. Thus, there is a strong need for Notch based biomarkers, especially with potential applicability for clinical assays. This prompted us to investigate DMXL2, which was recently presented as a novel Notch modulator. The DMXL2 gene has been recently described as a novel player in Notch signalling, regulating the acidification of intracellular compartments through the vacuolar protonic pump (V-ATPase) both in Drosophila and in mammalian systems [ 22 , 23 ]. The V-ATPase pump plays an important role in vesicular trafficking alongside endocytic and exocytic traffic [ 24 ]. We investigated the role of DMXL2 in the context of endocrine therapy resistance using patients’ derived clinical specimens and long-term estrogen deprived LTED cells [ 25 – 28 ]. Our results demonstrate that DMXL2 regulates Notch cleavage and chromatin recruitment, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, invasion and migration of endocrine therapy resistant breast cancer cells. Hence, DMXL2 can be identified as novel biomarker in ERα positive breast cancer patients.\nRESULTS\nNotch signalling is dependent on notch accumulation in the chromatin\nWe have previously shown that Notch signalling plays a significant role in the development of endocrine therapy resistance [ 18 , 19 , 29 , 30 ]. Notch signalling is partly dependent on the absolute amounts of Notch receptors present in the cells. However, there is substantial debate on the importance of different Notch receptors in endocrine resistance (reviewed in [ 31 ]). We reasoned that the rate of Notch activation, via its cleavage, is equally important to downstream signalling controlling tumor cell growth and survival. To test this, we first quantified total Notch levels using two isogenic cell lines: MCF7 and long-term estrogen deprived (LTED). The latter were derived from MCF7 following one year estrogen withdrawal to mimic endocrine therapy resistant breast cancer [ 28 ]. Notably, we find that all the receptors are downregulated at the protein level ( Figure 1A ). Notch1 is also downregulated at the mRNA level, whereas Notch3 and Notch4 mRNA levels are not ( Figure 1B ). Paradoxically, LTED cells contain higher protein levels of the Notch target Hey2, a well-characterized estrogen target gene [ 32 ] suggesting that receptor levels alone could not accurately predict Notch signalling ( Figure 1A ). LTED cells have impaired ERα signalling as a consequence of estradiol starvation, thus suggesting that Hey2 may be uniquely regulated by Notch in endocrine therapy resistant cells. Furthermore, we find that numerous additional Notch targets are also transcriptionally upregulated in LTED cells despite a general reduction in Notch receptor ( Figure 1B ). The discrepancy between total Notch protein levels and Notch target genes might be explained by hyper-activated Notch signalling via increased cleavage rates. To test this hypothesis, we measured Notch ICDs by chromatin fractionation and western blot, using ICD specific antibodies, which were designed and fully characterised in house (Supplementary Figure S1A–1B). Interestingly, we find that the LTED chromatin fraction presents greater enrichment for the Notch3 and Notch4 ICDs ( Figure 1C ). Importantly, we also screened a second LTED model, derived in a different lab (LTED clone 2) [ 10 ]. We confirmed that the total amount of Notch is dowregulated at protein level ( Figure 1D ) whereas Notch ICDs are upregulated in the chromatin fraction ( Figure 1F ). We also find Notch target genes are transcriptionally upregulated in the second clone ( Figure 1E ) thus confirming hyper-activated Notch signalling in endocrine therapy resistant cells.\nFigure 1: Notch pathway is upregulated in LTED and is dependent on DMXL2 overexpression.

Representative western blot showing (reported) Notch transmembrane domain (TM) and Notch target Hey2 in MCF7 and LTED cells (clone 1 and 2 respectively) Membranes were blotted with commercially available antibodies against Notch total level B–E. q(RT) PCR mRNA normalised to 28S of Notch receptors and Notch targets C–F. Cells were fractionated and the chromatin fraction was loaded. Membranes were blotted with in house-developed antibodies against the intracellular domain (Notch ICD).\nDMXL2 is over-expressed in metastatic breast tumors and is epigenetically activated in endocrine therapy resistant (ETR) cell lines\nThe recent discovery of DMXL2 as novel Notch regulator, prompted us to look into clinical setting. We built a case set including biopsies from ERα positive breast cancer patients treated with endocrine therapies. For each patient we measured DMXL2 in untreated primary breast cancer samples and matched metastatic samples resistant to endocrine therapy using IHC which revealed that DMXL2 had a membrane-cytoplasmic staining ( Figure 2A ). Using a pair-wise comparison we found a significant increase in DMXL2 staining in the metastatic samples ( Figure 2B ), suggesting that DMXL2 is upregulated in endocrine therapy resistant cells in vivo. Based on our findings in vivo, we decided to explore DMXL2 protein levels using a comprehensive panel of endocrine resistant cells including MCF7 derived tamoxifen or fulvestrant resistant (MCF7-TAMR, MCF7-FULVR), as well as MCF7 cultured in the absence of Estrogen (LTED). In addition, we have analysed two LTED-derived models, which also developed sequential resistance (LTED-TAMR and LTED-FULVR) [ 28 ]. Our data indicate that DMXL2 is upregulated in all the LTED models ( Figure 2C ) while MCF7-TAMR and MCF7-FULVR do not exhibit increased DMXL2 expression suggesting endocrine therapy specific modulation of DMXL2. In addition, we confirmed that changes in DMXL2 expression are not related to different culturing conditions (e.g. chronic drug exposure). LTED maintained high levels of DMXL2 even in the presence of parental MCF7 media (supplemented with E2), thus confirming that DMXL2 is not estradiol dependent but it is epigenetically stably overexpressed ( Figure 2D ). We also show that DMXL2 is significantly upregulated in the second clone ( Figure 2E ). DMXL2 overexpression is accompanied by increased chromatin marks typical of active regulatory elements (H3K27ac) at the DMXL2 promoter and nearby putative enhancers ( Figure 2F ). Similarly, the chromatin near DMXL2 regulatory elements is more accessible to transcription factor regulation in LTED compared to MCF7 lines as shown by DNaseI hypersensitivity assays followed by next generation sequencing. (DHS-seq, Figure 2F ). All the following experiments were performed using LTED clone 1 (henceforth identified as LTED).\nFigure 2: DMXL2 is overexpressed in metastatic tumors resistant to endocrine therapy. A. Primary and matched Metastatic samples were processed using DMXL2 IHC B. H scores were plotted. Pair-wise T-test between the average score (3 independent scorers, duplicate sections) was used to establish significance. DMXL2 is overexpressed in ETR cells and it is epigenetically activated. C.

Chip-seq tracks display the active regulatory elements near DMXL2 promoter are uniquely found in estrogen deprived cell lines (LTED cells), indicating the activation of DMXL2 gene in LTED cells, but not MCF7 cells.\nDMXL2 depletion impairs notch signalling in endocrine therapy resistant cells\nPrevious evidence suggests that DMXL2 might regulate Notch in breast cancer cells and that this regulation is dependent on the interaction between DMXL2 and the V-ATPase pump. [ 23 , 33 ]. Initially, we postulated that high levels of DMXL2 in endocrine resistant cells lines might result in increased Notch signalling. To test the role of DMXL2 in Notch signalling in the resistant cells, we measured Notch targets following DMXL2 depletion. As expected, siRNA mediated DMXL2 knock-down (Supplementary Figure S2A) significantly impairs Notch downstream signalling ( Figure 3A ). Furthermore, DMXL2 depleted LTED display less nuclear Hey2 protein levels demonstrating that DMXL2 is required in Notch signalling ( Figure 3B ). Importantly, following DMXL2 depletion we show augmented trans-membrane (TM) Notch1 and Notch4 at protein and mRNA levels ( Figure 3C ). Strikingly, this is associated with a decrease in the chromatin bound Notch intracellular domains (NICDs) ( Figure 3D ). These data strongly suggest that DMXL2 regulates Notch cleavage in endocrine therapy resistant breast cancer cell lines and mediates NICD chromatin accumulation.\nFigure 3: DMXL2 regulates Notch pathway.

Bars represent standard deviation.\nV-ATPase inhibition mimics DMXL2 depletion\nDMXL2 has been described as a regulator of the V-ATPase pump in drosophila and mammalian systems. Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence linking oncogenic Notch signalling to V-ATPase pump in mammals. [ 23 , 34 , 35 ]. First, we wanted to confirm that DMXL2 is required for V-ATPase activity. To do so, we performed DMXL2 depletion and measured pH by Lysotracker staining [ 36 ]. As expected, LTED cells depleted for DMXL2 show reduced Lysotracker staining confirming that DMXL2 is a pump regulator ( Figure 4A ). To directly inhibit the pump, we employed Bafilomycin A1 [ 37 ] and measured pH changes in the intracellular compartment. Bafilomycin A1 disrupts V-ATPase function, as shown by the reduction in Lysotracker staining ( Figure 4B ). These experiments were performed using 125 nM Bafilomycin A1, a dose that does not affect cell proliferation (data not shown). To confirm that Notch signalling is dependent on the V-ATPase activity in endocrine therapy resistant breast cancer cells, we monitored Notch intracellular domain (NICD) accumulation into the chromatin following Bafilomycin A1 treatment. We demonstrate that Notch3 and 4-ICD stop accumulating in the nucleus in a time dependent manner following Bafilomycin A1 treatment ( Figure 4C ) mirroring the effect of DMXL2 depletion ( Figure 3D ). In agreement, Notch targets are transcriptionally silenced at the same rate ( Figure 4D ). To further confirm that DMXL2 is upstream of Notch signalling, we performed a rescue experiment. We used Bafilomycin A1 to down-regulated Notch targets and then over-expressed Notch3 and Notch4ICDs. Notably, we were able to completely rescue their expression ( Figure 4E ). Overall, these data strongly suggest that increased Notch signalling in LTED is linked to V-ATPase acidification and that this is likely to be mediated by DMXL2 overexpression.\nFigure 4: DMXL2 depletion is mirrored by V-ATPase inhibition.

Importantly, Notch signalling has been linked to the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype [ 29 , 38 ]. Transcriptional and protein assays confirm that key EMT genes (ZEB1, IQGAP1, CDC42, and CD44) are significantly upregulated in LTED cells at mRNA levels and at protein levels (ZEB1 and IQGAP1). Moreover, loss of E-Cadherin and ZO1, a tight junction marker [ 39 ], were downregulated thus confirming LTED cells underwent EMT ( Figure 5A – 5B ). Recently, Tuttle and colleagues proposed that DMXL2 controls migration in Zebrafish Neural Crest [ 40 ] through its associated binding partner V-ATPase pump. Therefore we hypothesized that overexpressed DMXL2 could play a role in determining the invasive behaviour of LTED cell lines. DMXL2 depletion leads to a significant downregulation of the majority of EMT genes (IQGAP1 5C, D and ZEB1, CD44, and RAC2 in Figure 5D ) whilst tight junction marker ZO1 was upregulated ( Figure 5C – 5D ). Strikingly, DMXL2 depletion also resulted in a significant decrease in real time migration and invasion cells capacity ( Figure 5E – 5F ). These data suggest that DMXL2 is involved in the aggressive phenotype exhibited by LTED cells. Notably, DMXL2 depletion did not affect cell viability (Supplementary Figure S2B). Next, we confirmed that DMXL2 siRNA mediated knock down using a 3D invasion assay. Remarkably, DMXL2 depletion significantly impairs the formation of pseudopodia and the invasion of the extra-cellular matrix in LTED cells ( Figure 5G ). We then wanted to confirm these findings using Bafilomycin A1 since we have shown that direct inhibition of the V-ATPase pump phenocopy DMXL2 depletion. Interestingly, main EMT targets are significantly reduced upon Bafilomycin A1 treatment and the tight junction marker ZO1 is upregulated ( Figure 5H ). Furthermore, Bafilomycin A1 treatment significantly impairs invasion in our 3D invasion assay ( Figure 5I ). Moreover, in agreement with our previous results ( Figure 4E ) Notch ICD overexpression was sufficient to rescue EMT genes expression in Bafylomicin treated cells ( Figure 5L ). Altogether, these evidences strongly support DMXL2 as a major player in determining mesenchymal switch in our endocrine resistant cell line model.\nFigure 5: DMXL2 regulates mesenchymal switch in LTED cells.

DXML2 is thought to control the modulation of the pump assembly/disassembly process [ 41 , 42 ]. We speculated that DMXL2 could also be a peripheral membrane protein. To test this, we first employed EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin to label cell surface proteins and confirm an increase of signal from DMXL2 protein outside LTED cells membrane ( Figure 6A ). Next, we used several publicly available informatics predictive algorithms (e.g. MEMSAT, PSIPRED, TMHMM, TMPRED [ 43 – 46 ] to test if DMXL2 carries potential transmembrane domains. Notably, several algorithms predicted the same potential transmemembrane domain ( Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure S3). We further investigated this possibility, using two different antibodies: one mapping onto the potential outer domain, and one mapping onto the putative cytoplasmic end (They were both fully characterised in Supplementary Figure S2A–2D). Live immunofluorescence without cell permeabilization shows that only the antibody interacting with the potential extra-cellular domain could detect DMXL2 ( Figure 6C ). Overall, these data strongly suggest that DMXL2 could be a peripheral membrane protein with a potentially targetable extracellular domain.\nFigure 6: DMXL2 has a potential extracellular domain. A. Western blot showing cells labeled with biotin and processed as described in material and methods. EGFR and Actin are used as controls B. Graphs showing DMXL2 putative transmembrane domain C. Representative live immunofluorescence images showing DMXL2 is detected only with the antibody interacting with the potential extracellular domain (AbCAm antibody). Bars represent 400 uM.\nDISCUSSION\nHere we demonstrate that DMXL2 overexpression drives Notch signalling and EMT transition in endocrine therapy resistant breast cancer cells. DMXL2 activity impinges on the V-ATPase pump and can be antagonized using siRNA or chemical inhibitors. More importantly, DMXL2 increases in vivo in patients who relapse following treatment with endocrine therapy.\nNotch is involved in numerous pathways and plays a significant role in tumor progression and metastasis [ 10 ]. However, there is still a lack of understanding of the molecular details of Notch signalling, especially in cancer cells. On this ground, we investigated DMXL2 as it was recently discovered as a novel potential Notch regulator [ 22 , 23 ]. We show that DMXL2 expression significantly correlates with the development of endocrine resistance. However we cannot exclude that a resistant pre-existent population with high levels of DMXL2 emerge during chronic exposure to treatment. At any rate our data provide novel insights that explain apparent contradictory results such as that ETR cells have enhanced Notch signalling while having lower total Notch receptors. This suggests the processing rate of the Notch receptors cleavage might be more accurate in predicting actual Notch signalling compared the total unprocessed protein levels. DMXL2 appears to be essential in this process as direct DMXL2 suppression or blockage of the V-ATPase activity result in an important reduction of NICD accumulation in the chromatin fraction.\nDrug resistance is a major hurdle for patients with ERα breast cancer. A spectrum of published research supports Notch as a key player in drug resistance [ 18 , 19 , 29 , 47 ]; therefore targeting this pathway is becoming more and more attractive [ 48 , 49 ]. The mechanisms behind drug resistance are not completely understood but increasing evidence suggests that resistant cells may epigenetically activate alternative pathways [ 19 , 50 ]. Our model suggests that DMXL2 is upregulated in response to endocrine therapy treatment and contributes to a the more aggressive phenotype observed in these cells.\nA recent work from Tuttle and colleagues uncovered a potential role of DMXL2 and V-ATPase in EMT/migration of neuronal crest in Zebrafish models. Based on these findings and on the highlight of our recent work [ 29 ], we wanted to explore the role of DMXL2 in driving the mesenchymal switch in therapy resistant breast cancer. We reveal for the first time that DMXL2 is responsible for driving the mesenchymal switch in ETR cells and that blocking DMXL2 significantly impairs both migration and invasion. We also demonstrate that DMXL2 is a V-ATPase interacting partner and the pump acidification controls Notch signalling. Indeed, blocking V-ATPase using Bafilomicyn A1 mirrors DMXL2 depletion and impairs Notch binding to the chromatin as well as invasion. DMXL2 overexpression in ETR cell lines, and its implication in metastatic development, gave us the idea of looking in the clinical setting. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that DMXL2 protein is present in patients with ERα breast cancer. Notably, DMXL2 increases dramatically during breast cancer progression, in agreement with our cell line model.\nV-ATPase inhibition, through Bafilomycin A1, causes tumor regression and metastasis inhibition in vivo and in vitro [ 51 ]. Based on these facts, we reasoned that manipulating Notch via DMXL2 inhibition could be an exciting route that warrants further investigation. At the moment, the approach taken to target Notch signalling had been through the use of GSIs that inhibit signalling by all four Notch receptors [ 52 , 53 ]. Our recent works showed that using monoclonal antibodies to target the extra-cellular domain of Nicastrin, the catalytic subunit of the GS complex, greatly reduced the tumor bulk in vivo and limits invasion and migration in vitro [ 29 , 54 ]. Here, we show that DMXL2 likely has an extracellular portion. This warrants further investigation focusing on the development of monoclonal antibodies targeting DMXL2 as an alternative option to block Notch in breast cancer.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell culture\nCells were originated as previously described [ 28 ]. MCF7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). LTED were maintained in phenol-red free DMEM containing 10% charcoal stripped fetal calf serum (SFCS). Both media were supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL. 10−8 M Estradiol (E2758 Sigma) was added routinely to MCF7. Cells used in Figures 1 and 2 and named “clone 2”, were independently derived [ 19 ]. 10−7 Tamoxifen (H7904 Sigma) and Fulvestrant (I4409 Sigma) were added to TAMR and FULVR cells.\nMigration and invasion assay\nThis assay was performed as previously described (Nguyen et al., under revision). Briefly, real time cell analysis (RTCA) was carried on using xCELLigence technology (Cambridge Bioscience), and 40,000 cells were seeded on a well of 16-transwell CIM-PLATES with/without matrigel to monitor migration and invasion respectively. Prior to each experiment, cells were subjected to 48/24 hrs DMXL2 knock down, harvested, counted, and then allowed to migrate or invade for 24–48 hours respectively (total knock down 72 hrs). Serum free medium was used to resuspend and seed the cells, and 10% FCS or DC/FCS full medium was used as chemo-attractant.\nRNA extraction and real time RT_PCR\nRNA extraction and cDNA preparation were performed as previously described [ 29 ]. Briefly, QIAGEN columns were used for RNA extraction. 2 ug were retro-transcribed using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription (AB 4368814 Applied Biosystem). 2X SYBR GREEN mix (4309155 Invitrogen) was used to perform quantitative real time RT-PCR. The PCR amplification was as follows: 95°C (10 min), 95°C (10 sec), 60°C (30 sec), 72°C (30 seconds), 40 cycles followed by melting curve analysis. Melting curves were analysed after 40 cycles. Expression levels of each gene were evaluated using comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method using the 2-ΔΔCt method with normalization to 28S housekeeping gene. Primers sequences are available upon request.\nsiRNA\nSilencers Select Small interfering RNA (siRNA) against DMXL2 were purchased from Invitrogen (s23533, s23534). Silencer Select Negative 1 was used as control (4404020). Briefly, 300,000 cells were seeded on a 6 well plate. The following day Lipofectamine 2000 (11668) was used according to the manufacturer protocol. 5 nM siRNA were used as final concentration. RNA and proteins were analysed 24 and 72 hours later respectively.\nOverexpression\nNotch1, Notch3 and Notch4 ICDs were a kind gift from Keith Brennan. Plasmids were fully sequenced. Lipofectamine 2000 was used according to the instructions. 300,000 cells were seeded on day 1. The following day, 1 ug of DNA was used for transfection. Cells were harvested and lysed 24 hrs later.\nRescue experiment\nLTED cells (200,000) were seeded on 6 well plates. The following day 500pM Bafilomycin A1 was added to the medium. After 6 hours, cells were transfected with 1 ug of Notch3, 4 plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer instructions. 24 hours later, mRNA was extracted according to the manufacturer instructions (QIAGEN). DMSO was used as control.\n3D organoids assay (hanging drop assay)\nA 3D assay was performed as previously described (Nguyen et al. under revision). Briefly, 250,000 cells were resuspended in 1ml of medium. Drops (20 ul) were placed onto the lid of a 10 cm dish, then the lid was flipped onto of the dish, containing 5 ml of media to prevent evaporation. The dish was then incubated for 5 days at 37°C. On day 5, the newly formed organoids were mounted on 10ul phenol red free matrigel (356237) on a coverslip in a 24 well plate. Matrigel was left for 1 hr at 37°C in the incubator to solidify, then 500 ul of full medium was added. Pictures were taken at day 0 and day 2. In knock down experiments, siDMXL2 or siControl were added to the cells before making the drops. In Bafilomycin A1 experiments, the drug was added to the medium on day 0 for 48 hours.\nImmunofluorescence\nBriefly, cells were seeded on coverslips on a 6 well plate. On the final day, cells were washed twice with room temperature PBS and 4% PFA/PBS was added for 15 minutes. Cells were washed twice with PBS and NH4Cl was added as quencher. 1% Triton/PBS was added for 5 minutes. 10% BSA/PBS was used as blocking reagent. 5% BSA/PBS was used to dilute antibodies and Alexa-fluor 488 or 594labelled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies. Cells were mounted in mounting medium (MOWIOL) containing 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. For live immunofluorescence, no fixative was used. Pictures were acquired using EVOS microscope system (Advanced Microscopy Group, Bothell, WA, USA) or Leica SP5 confocal microscope.\nAntibodies-drugs\nWe used two antibodies against DMXL2 (24415-1-AP from Proteintech) for western blot and immunofluorescence and ab122552 (abCam) for IHC and immunofluorescence. Antibodies against Notch1 and Notch3 were purchased from Cell Signalling (3608, and 2889) and Notch4 was purchased from Santa Cruz (Sc-5594 H-225). Actin and V5 antibodies were purchased from abCam (ab6276 and ab9116). ZEB1 (3396), ZO1 (8193), E-Cadherin (3195), and IQGAP1 (2293) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signalling. Bafilomycin A1 was purchased from Sigma (B1793). TBP was purchased from Santa Cruz. LysoTracker (LysoTracker® Red DND-99 Life Technologies) was used according to the manufacturer protocol for labelling acidic organelles in live cells following Bafilomycin A1 and DMXL2 siRNA treatments. In knock down experiments, the LysoTracker was added after 72 hours. Estradiol for culturing MCF7 was also purchased from Sigma and diluted in 100% Ethanol in a final concentration of 10−7M. Biotinylation assay was performed according to the manufacturer protocol (21435 Thermo Scientific). GSI was purchased from Pfizer, Inc (New York, NY, USA) (PF03084014). Dll4 ligand was purchased from abCAm (108557).\nWestern blot and fractionation\nRIPA (Sigma) was used to prepare total lysate. Fractionation method was performed as previously described [ 55 ]. Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Scientific) was used to determine protein concentration. Equal amounts of lysates were subjected to immunoblotting on SDS-PAGE. IRDyes IR680, IR680-LT, or IR800 (LI-COR) were used as secondary antibodies. LI-COR Odyssey 2.1 system was used to visualise proteins. 16-bit images were analyzed and quantified using Image J.\nTissue microarray (TMA) of paired primary and secondary breast cancers\nTwenty primary breast carcinomas with a paired metastasis were acquired from the pathology archives of Charing Cross Hospital, London, UK. A tissue microarray was constructed using a manual microarray (Beecher) and 0.6 mm punches. The tissue microarray was immunohistochemically profiled for DMXL2 and other biological antibodies as previously described (ref?). DMXL2 rabbit antibody (ab122552, abCam) was optimized to a working concentration (1:500 in PBS); utilizing tissue sections (5 μm). Antigen retrieval was performed using 0.01M citrate buffer, pH 6.0 followed by blocking in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS, then in normal goat serum (20 μl per ml) for 30 min. The primary antibody was incubated overnight at 4°C, and then detected using anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories), Vectastain Elite peroxidase ABC kit, and ImmPACT DAB kit (Vector Laboratories). Subsequently, 4 μm TMA sections were immuno-stained using the optimized staining protocol, including negative controls (omission of the primary antibody). Staining was scored based on the H-score and Allred Quick score (LM, MF). Cores were scored using an H-score by three independent investigators (including one consultant pathologist) blinded to the clinico-pathological characteristics of patients. H = (3 × % of strongly stained cells) + (2 × % of moderately stained cells) + (1 × % of weakly stained cells) + (0 × % of cells without staining). This gave a score ranging from total absence of DMXL2 in the tumor compartment (H-score 0) to DMXL2 expression in tumor cells equivalent to surrounding normal and stromal cells (H-score 300).\nStatistical analysis\nTwo-tailed paired T-test was used to generate P-values (indicated as *P = 0.05, **P = 0.01, and ***P = 0.001). Anova test with Tukey’s post test was used to generate P-values for the rescue experiment (*P = 0.05, **P = 0.01).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust Tissue Bank provided tissue samples.

This study investigated asthma symptoms among Malaysian schoolchildren in relation to indoor and outdoor air pollution in urban and semi-rural settings in a school-based cross-sectional study of 1,952 schoolchildren living in urban and semi-rural areas. Parents completed a questionnaire including questions on asthma symptoms and environmental risk factors. Air pollutant concentrations were measured at 16 schools. Analysis used multiple logistic regression controlling for sociodemographic and indoor air pollution factors. A total of 11.4, 7.6, 9.5 and 7.0 % schoolchildren had asthma, current wheeze, dry cough at night and wheezing after exercise, respectively. Asthma and dry cough were significantly higher among urban schoolchildren. A 10-μg/m3 increase in outdoor NO2 level was associated with a twofold increase in the reporting of current wheeze (odds ratio (OR) 1.90; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.02–3.52); a 10-μg/m3 increase in indoor PM2.5 was similarly associated with a twofold increase in the reporting of wheeze during exercise (OR 2.08; 95 % CI 1.02–4.26). Secondhand smoke (SHS), mold and the presence of new furniture at home were also linked to asthma symptoms. NO2 concentrations in urban Malaysia frequently exceed those of the international standards. Exposure to traffic-related air pollution may be linked to asthma symptoms among children in Malaysia.\nKeywords\nIndoor air quality Urban Semi-rural Traffic-related pollution Asthma Children \nReferences\nAfroz R, Hassan MN, Ibrahim NA (2003) Review of air pollution and health impacts in Malaysia.

As drinking patterns are important determinants of the beneficial and harmful effects of alcohol consumption, we investigated alcohol consumption in relation to nutrient intake, place of consumption, education and body weight in a sample of adults from 10 European countries.\nMethods:\n \nA 24-h dietary recall interview was conducted on 13 025 men and 23 009 women, aged 35–74 years, from 27 centres participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Means and standard errors of alcohol consumption, adjusted for age, were calculated, stratified by gender and centre.\nResults:\n \nIn many centres, higher level drinkers (males consuming >24 g of ethanol/day, equivalent to >2 standard drinks and females consuming >12 g of ethanol/day equivalent to >1 standard drink) obtained more energy from fat and protein and less from sugar than did abstainers. The proportion of energy from starch tended to be higher for male and lower for female higher level drinkers than for abstainers. Female higher level drinkers had a lower body mass index than did abstainers, whereas male higher level drinkers generally weighed more. Male higher level drinkers were less educated than abstainers in Mediterranean countries, but were more educated elsewhere. Female higher level drinkers were usually more educated than were abstainers. Outside the home, consumption (both genders) tended to be at friends' homes, particularly among men in Northern and Central Europe, and in bars in Spain.\nConclusions:\n \nThis study reveals clear geographical differences in drinking habits across Europe, and shows that the characteristics of different alcohol consumption categories also vary.\nKeywords:\nTop of page\nIntroduction\nEurope has the highest level of alcohol consumption in the world ( Rehm et al., 2003a ). Studies on drinking patterns across Europe, in terms of place of consumption, types of beverage consumed, and time and context of drinking are important, as there is evidence that drinking patterns, in addition to the quantity and type of alcoholic beverage consumed, influence the beneficial and harmful effects of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption can be studied from various viewpoints. From a public health perspective, alcohol consumption can increase the risk of health problems (traffic and other accidents, chronic illnesses, etc.) as well as social problems. Against this burden, there is substantial evidence that light-to-moderate alcohol consumption reduces the risk of total mortality by protecting against cardiovascular disease ( Corrao et al., 2000 ; Rehm et al., 2003b ). The lower risk of heart disease in moderate drinkers compared with abstainers and heavy drinkers could be through a direct protective effect or because of confounding cultural factors and associated traits, such as more physical activity, healthier diet, better cognitive function and higher socioeconomic status ( Gronbaek, 2007 ).\nEpidemiological studies have paid particular attention to differences in diet in relation to drinking patterns. Several studies have reported that drinkers consumed more meat and fewer dairy products, fruits, cereals and sucrose than did non-drinkers ( Hebert and Kabat, 1991 ; Colditz et al., 1991 ; La Vecchia et al., 1992 ). A Dutch study on people aged between 22 and 44 years ( Veenstra et al., 1993 ) found a strong positive relationship between alcohol consumption and energy intake, but differences in intakes of selected nutrients between abstainers, moderate drinkers and heavy drinkers were limited to slightly higher nutrient intakes in drinkers. The MONICA study found a direct association between alcohol and polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) consumption ( Nuttens et al., 1992 ). A report on control subjects in a hospital-based case–control study conducted in Northern Italy found that alcohol consumption, education and smoking were important correlates of dietary patterns ( D'Avanzo et al., 1997 ). The associations revealed by these studies were generally less clear in women than in men, possibly because women tend not to indulge in extreme alcohol consumption.\nAlcohol is an energy-dense macronutrient, regular consumption of which may increase body mass index (BMI). Several studies have, however, shown an inverse association between alcohol intake and BMI in women ( Gruchow et al., 1985 ; Colditz et al., 1991 ; Slattery et al., 1992 ), whereas a similar relation is observed less consistently in men ( Jones et al., 1982 ; Slattery et al., 1992 ).\nThe relation between alcohol consumption and education level has been investigated in several studies, which reported that people (both genders) with fewer qualifications are more prone to heavy drinking ( Knibbe et al., 1985 ; Droomers et al., 1999 ; van Oers et al., 1999 ).\nIn a previous analysis on a selected sample of adults from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, we described differences in alcohol consumption across EPIC centres in terms of ethanol intake, types of beverage (wine, beer and spirits), context of consumption (mealtimes versus outside mealtimes) and distribution of consumption during the week ( Sieri et al., 2002 ). In this study, we investigated the relation of alcohol consumption to nutrient intake and place of consumption, using the same detailed and standardized data obtained through a single computerized 24-hour dietary recall (24-HDR) interview administered to a large EPIC subsample.\nMaterials and methods\nSetting and subjects\nEPIC is a prospective study conducted on half a million adult volunteers enroled between 1992 and 2000 in 23 centres in 10 Western European countries: Denmark (Copenhagen, Aarhus), France (south coast, south, north-west, north-east), Germany (Heidelberg, Potsdam), Greece, Italy (Varese, Turin, Florence, Naples, Ragusa), the Netherlands (Bilthoven, Utrecht), Norway (south and east, north and west), Spain (Granada, Murcia, Navarra, San Sebastian, Asturias), Sweden (Malmö, Umeå) and the United Kingdom. The initial 23 EPIC centres were redefined into 27 centres relevant to analyses of dietary consumption and patterns ( Slimani et al., 2002 ). In the United Kingdom, a ‘health-conscious’ group involving mainly lacto-ovo vegetarians and vegans, essentially from Oxford, was considered separately from a ‘general population’ group recruited by general practitioners in Cambridge and Oxford.\nThe design and methodology of EPIC are described in detail elsewhere ( Riboli and Kaaks, 1997 ; Riboli et al., 2002 ). Briefly, the study recruited volunteers who signed an informed consent form. Most centres recruited both genders, except Norway, France, Utrecht and Naples, which had all-women cohorts. Participants completed dietary and lifestyle questionnaires, and their anthropometric measurements were recorded by trained health professionals (self-reported in France, Norway and Oxford). The source populations varied: the general population of a town or province, cancer-screening programmes or blood donor associations.\nFor calibration purposes, a standardized 24-HDR interview was administered to a random sample (36 994 persons) of the entire EPIC cohort, stratified by age, gender and centre, and weighted for expected cancer cases in each stratum. The dietary interview was undertaken between 1995 and 2000 to improve comparability of dietary data across centres and to partially correct for dietary measurement error arising from centre-specific bias, and random and systematic within-person errors in diet–disease associations ( Ferrari et al., 2004 ). Invitations to attend the interview were organized so as to ensure, as far as possible, a uniform distribution of interviews by day of the week and season of the year. Persons under 35 and over 74 years were excluded from the sample, leaving a total of 36 034 persons for analysis in this study.\nAscertainment of diet and other lifestyle factors\nThe 24-HDR was administered in a face-to-face interview, except in Norway where it was conducted by telephone ( Brustad et al., 2003 ). Interviewers elicited 24-h dietary recall by conducting interviews in a uniform manner under the real-time guidance of the EPIC-SOFT software, which was developed for the purpose by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in collaboration with all EPIC centres ( Slimani et al., 2000 ). The interview obtained, among other data, detailed information on the distribution of alcohol consumption following the chronological order of the day, structured according to 11 common food consumption occasions (FCOs) described below. Place of consumption was also elicited. Alcoholic beverages were quantified during the interview using household measures of fixed size (glasses) or standard units (bottles of wine, cans of beer, etc). All quantities were automatically transformed by the programme into grams of beverage consumed. The EPIC Nutrient Database ( Slimani et al., 2007 ) was used to convert quantities of beverages into alcohol (ethanol). The alcohol consumption of individuals on recall day was calculated as the sum of the alcohol content of all beverages consumed.\nIn the EPIC study, country-specific (or in some cases centre-specific) dietary questionnaires designed to capture local long-term individual dietary habits were used, in contrast to standardized single 24-HDR interviews obtained from an EPIC subsample and used to estimate population means for calibration purposes. The EPIC dietary questionnaires are described in detail elsewhere ( Riboli et al., 2002 ). Briefly, eight countries used self-administered dietary questionnaires, whereas in Greece, Spain and Southern Italy (Naples and Ragusa), the questionnaires were administered by interviewers. In most countries, the questionnaires were extensive quantitative instruments (with up to 260 food items). In Denmark, Norway, Umeå and Naples, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires were used ( Riboli et al., 2002 ).\nData on other lifestyle factors, including education, total physical activity and smoking history, considered in this analysis were collected at baseline through standardized questionnaires and clinical examinations, and have been described for the calibration sample elsewhere ( Riboli et al., 2002 ; Haftenberger et al., 2002a , 2002b ; Slimani et al., 2002 ). Data on age, as well as body weight and height were self-reported by participants during the 24-HDR interview. The mean time interval between these baseline questionnaire measures and the 24-HDR interview varied by country, from 1 day to 3 years later ( Slimani et al., 2002 ).\nClassification of alcohol consumption\nThe classification of the EPIC-SOFT food subgroups used in the 24-HDR is described in detail elsewhere ( Slimani et al., 2002 ). Alcoholic beverages were classified into eight groups: wines, fortified wines, beer (including cider), spirits, aniseed drinks, liqueurs, cocktails/punches and all other alcoholic beverages. In this study, we present results for wine, beer/cider, spirits and total alcohol intake only, as other alcohol sources were negligible except in one or two centres.\nAlcohol consumption was collected in a standardized way according to the following common 11 FCOs included in the EPIC-SOFT programme: before breakfast, breakfast, in the morning, before lunch, lunch, after lunch, in the afternoon, before dinner, dinner, after dinner, in the evening/at night. In this study, we present results for the main FCOs, namely, breakfast, lunch and dinner, and merge all the other FCOs into the ‘other’ category.\nPlaces where alcohol was potentially consumed were home, work, fast-food restaurant, bar, cafeteria, restaurant, friends' home, school, street, car/boat/plane and other. We decided to fuse the categories in the following manner: work, school and cafeteria into ‘work’; and other, street, car/boat/plane into ‘other’. For analysis of beverage type according to place of consumption, we fused fast-food restaurant with restaurant and excluded the category ‘other’, therefore, the categories considered in this analysis are bar, work, restaurant, friends' home and home.\nGender-specific categories of alcohol consumption were created using information from the dietary questionnaire, as it is impossible to distinguish habitual drinkers from non-drinkers using a single 24-HDR. Abstainers were defined as those who reported no alcohol consumption in the questionnaire. For men, we derived four categories of drinkers: (1) ‘non-drinkers/abstainers’; (2) ‘1–12 g/day of alcohol corresponding to\n1 drink’; (3) ‘12.1–24 g/day corresponding to 1 to 2 drinks’; and (4) ‘>24 g/day corresponding to more than 2 drinks’. In women, three categories were considered: (1) ‘non-drinkers/abstainers’; (2) ‘1–12 g/day or\n1 drink’; and (3) ‘>12 g/day or >1 drink’. In both genders, the highest gender-specific categories were referred to as the ‘higher level drinkers’ category.\nStatistical methods\nWe calculated minimally adjusted means of total alcohol consumption by centre using generalized linear models in which covariance analysis took account of a possible confounding effect of age, and a weighting procedure took account of the uneven distribution between centres of interviews by day of the week (weekday versus weekend) and season ( Table 1 ). For the latter, we used weightings calculated as the ratio of the expected to the observed numbers interviewed in each season and a part of the week for each centre and gender. We also calculated fully adjusted means in a further model including energy intake, height and weight available in the Appendix (Table A1 ).\nFull table\nTo assess any gender-specific effect on alcohol consumption, a model that included men and women was used to test for interaction between centre and gender. Stratified analyses were carried out for FCOs and for places of consumption. Age was included as a continuous variable in the covariance analysis.\nAnalyses were performed using STATA statistical package (Stata version 7.0; Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA).\nTop of page\nResults\nTable 1 shows minimally adjusted means of alcohol consumption by study centre, stratified by age classes and gender, and weighted for season and day of the week of interview. Alcohol intake varied greatly between centres, and between men and women. In men, alcohol consumption was highest in Copenhagen (Denmark) and lowest in Umeå (Sweden). In Varese and Turin (Italy), and in Asturias and San Sebastian (Spain), alcohol consumption was higher in older age groups, whereas elsewhere it peaked at an earlier age. Among women, the Danish centres (Copenhagen and Aarhus) had the highest alcohol intake, and the Mediterranean centres of Granada, Navarra, Greece and Ragusa had the lowest. Among women, alcohol consumption generally decreased with age, irrespective of centre.\nAfter further energy, and height and weight adjustments, the estimated mean alcohol intake was still highest in Copenhagen and was lowest in Umeå among men. Although these adjustments had little effect for most centres, it considerably increased the estimated mean alcohol intake in Greece and in the UK health-conscious group, and considerably decreased intake in San Sebastian and Varese (Table A1). Among women, the only systematic effects of energy adjustment were that the estimated mean alcohol intake increased in Greece and Granada, and decreased in Aarhus and in the north-east and south coast of France (Table A1).\nTables 2a and b show minimally adjusted means of non-alcohol energy and mean percentages of energy obtained from protein, starch and sugar by alcohol consumption categories for men and women, respectively. Energy intake, excluding calories from alcohol, was lower in male higher level drinkers than in abstainers in all Northern and Central European centres. Among women, higher level drinkers consumed more non-alcohol energy than did abstainers in all Mediterranean centres, except Ragusa, but less non-alcohol energy in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Denmark.\nFull table\nMale higher level drinkers obtained slightly more energy from protein than did abstainers in most centres (except Granada and Ragusa) and less from sugar than did abstainers in most centres (except Granada). The proportion of energy from starch was higher in higher level drinkers than in abstainers in Granada, Navarra, Murcia, Ragusa, the United Kingdom, Umeå and Aarhus.\nFemale higher level drinkers obtained more energy from protein than did abstainers in most centres (except Granada, Naples and North-West France). They also obtained less energy from sugar than did abstainers (except in Granada and the UK general population). The proportion of energy obtained from starch was higher in female higher level drinkers than in abstainers in most Mediterranean centres (except in France, Naples, Navarra and Asturias), but was lower in other centres.\nTables 2c and d show minimally adjusted means of non-alcohol energy obtained from total fat and fat subtypes by alcohol consumption category in men and women, respectively. Male higher level drinkers obtained more energy from total fat than did abstainers in most centres (except in Potsdam, in the UK health-conscious group, Aarhus and Umeå). Male higher level drinkers in Potsdam, Aarhus and Umeå obtained slightly less energy from saturated fat than did abstainers, those in Aarhus also obtained less energy from monounsaturated fat (MUFA) and those in Umeå obtained less energy from PUFA. In Greece, Granada, Bilthoven, the UK general population and Copenhagen, total fat consumption increased as alcohol intake increased. Among women, higher level drinkers obtained more energy from total fat than did abstainers in most centres, except the southern centres of Greece, Granada and Ragusa, as well as Aarhus. In Greece, female higher level drinkers consumed the same amount of saturated fat but less MUFA and more PUFA than did abstainers, whereas in Granada, they obtained less energy from saturated fat, MUFA and PUFA than did abstainers. In Ragusa, female higher level drinkers obtained less energy from all kinds of fat than did abstainers. In Aarhus, they obtained less energy from saturated fat and MUFA, and more from PUFA, than did abstainers.\nFull table\nFor women in most centres (except from Greece, Granada, Navarra, San Sebastian, Ragusa, Naples, Turin, south coast France, the UK general population and Aarhus), the energy obtained from total fat increased as alcohol intake increased. Tables 3a and b show mean percentages of energy obtained from non-alcohol macronutrients (fat, carbohydrate and protein) at selected FCOs (breakfast, lunch, dinner and others) by categories of alcohol consumption, for men and women, respectively. In Mediterranean countries, male higher level drinkers consumed less non-alcohol energy than did non-drinkers at breakfast in most centres (exceptions are Ragusa and Turin) and more non-alcohol energy at lunch and dinner than did non-drinkers. In Spanish centres, male higher level drinkers consumed more non-alcohol energy than did abstainers at other FCOs.\nFull table\nIn Central European countries, male higher level drinkers consumed less non-alcohol energy than did non-drinkers at breakfast in some centres (exceptions are Heidelberg and the UK general population), and less non-alcohol energy at lunch and more at dinner than did non-drinkers. Moreover, the proportion of energy obtained from non-alcohol sources was higher in higher level drinkers than in abstainers at other FCOs in all centres except in the UK general population. In Northern European countries, the proportion of energy obtained from non-alcohol sources at breakfast among the male higher level drinkers was lower than that for non-drinkers only in Copenhagen and Malmö. Male higher level drinkers consumed more non-alcohol energy at lunch than did abstainers in most northern centres, except Umea, and more non-alcohol energy at dinner in all centres. Higher level drinkers consumed less non-alcohol energy at other FCOs in northern countries.\nNon-alcohol energy consumption at breakfast was lower for female higher level drinkers than for abstainers in most Mediterranean centres (except Granada, Asturias and Ragusa), whereas the proportion of energy obtained from non-alcohol sources was higher at lunch and dinner compared with that for non-drinkers ( Table 3b ). In non-Mediterranean countries, female higher level drinkers consumed more non-alcohol energy than did non-drinkers at lunch, whereas there was no clear trend at breakfast and dinner. Female higher level drinkers consumed more non-alcohol energy than did abstainers at other FCOs in Greece, most Spanish centres (except San Sebastian and Asturias), Germany, the Netherlands and the UK general population, but they consumed less non-alcohol energy than did abstainers at other FCOs in Italy, France (except the north-west) and Scandinavia.\nFigures 1a and b show the proportions of alcohol consumed at different locations by men and women, respectively. Both men and women consumed most alcohol at home (range 53% (Asturias) to 90.4% (Ragusa) for men, and 72.2% (Copenhagen) to 89.8% (Ragusa) for women). Spanish men drank more than 20% of their alcohol in bars. In Greece, Denmark, Sweden, Heidelberg and Bilthoven, men consumed a non-negligible proportion of alcohol at friends' homes (range 6.9–11.8%), whereas this proportion was low at all other centres (range 1.9–5.2%).\nFull figure and legend (596 K )\nAmong women, the proportion of alcohol consumed at home was similar in all centres (range 72.2–89.8%). More alcohol was consumed at friends' homes in Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Murcia, Naples, South and North-West France (10–19.5%) than in other centres (2.1–9.8%). Spanish and British women consumed more alcohol (5.3–16.5%) in bars than did women in other centres (0–4.2%).\nTable 4a shows the proportions of alcohol obtained by men from different types of beverages at each location considered. Among men, the main source of alcohol in the Mediterranean and Danish centres was wine, whereas beer was the main source in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and in the UK general population. Spirits were an important source of alcohol in Greece, Spain, The Netherlands, the UK general population, Sweden and Denmark. Among men, wine was mainly consumed at home in most centres (except Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and the UK health-conscious group). In the latter centres, beer was mainly consumed at home, followed by wine and spirits. In some centres of Spain (Navarra, San Sebastian and Asturias) and Italy (Florence, Turin and Varese), more alcohol consumed at home was obtained from spirits than from beer. At work, restaurants and bars, the main alcohol source was wine in Mediterranean countries, but it was beer in non-Mediterranean countries (only in restaurants in the Netherlands and Denmark). The main source of alcohol at friends' homes was wine everywhere, except in the German and Dutch centres, where it was beer.\nFull table\nAmong women ( Table 4b ), the main source of alcohol was wine in all centres except in Murcia (Spain). The consumption of beer was high in Murcia and Aarhus. Spirits were an important source of alcohol in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Scandinavian countries. Among women, wine was mainly consumed at home except in Murcia, but in Germany, the Netherlands, Scandinavia and Greece, beer also figured prominently, as did spirits in the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. Wine was the main source of alcohol consumed at work (except in Sweden) and restaurants (except Murcia, Naples and Ragusa). At friends' homes, wine was usually the only alcoholic beverage consumed by women, except in Greece where the main alcohol source was spirits. In Scandinavia, Germany, the UK general population and the Netherlands, a non-negligible proportion of alcohol also came from beer and spirits.\nFull table\nWomen's preferred drink in bars was wine in Spanish centres, in Northern Italy (Turin, Varese), the UK general population, Potsdam, Utrecht, Malmö and North-West Norway. Only in the British and Spanish centres did women consume spirits in bars.\nTable 5 shows mean BMI by categories of alcohol consumption for men and women. Male higher level drinkers had a higher BMI than did abstainers in many centres (except Murcia, Ragusa, Florence, Germany, the Netherlands, Copenhagen and Umeå). In contrast, there was a clear inverse relation between alcohol consumption and BMI in women at all centres except in France and the UK health-conscious group.\nTop of page\nDiscussion\nIn a previous study using the same EPIC datasets as those used in this paper, we analysed patterns of alcohol consumption and found that consumption was highest in the two Danish centres; that men drank more than women; that men's alcohol intake came mostly from wine in Southern Europe and from beer in other countries; and that in most centres, women's main alcohol source was wine ( Sieri et al., 2002 ). Furthermore, increased weekend drinking was a characteristic of Northern Europe, whereas alcohol consumption is generally restricted to mealtimes in Mediterranean countries ( Sieri et al., 2002 ).\nIn this study, we found that patterns of alcohol consumption varied markedly across centres, and hence across Europe in terms of total amount consumed, association with nutrient intake, BMI, education level and place of consumption.\nAlcohol consumption in men and women decreased with age, although in some Mediterranean centres, it increased in the oldest age category. Mediterranean men and women who were higher level drinkers generally had a higher total energy intake than did abstainers, even when calories from alcohol were excluded. By contrast, in Scandinavian countries (Denmark and Sweden), higher level drinkers had lower total and non-alcohol energy intakes than did abstainers.\nStudies that have investigated differences in energy intake according to drinking habits have reported discordant results. Some studies found that total energy intake increased with increasing alcohol consumption ( Colditz et al., 1991 ; Toniolo et al., 1991 ; Veenstra et al., 1993 ), although Mannisto et al. (1997) reported the opposite. The results diverged even more when energy from alcohol was excluded. Toniolo et al. (1991) found, as we did, that in Mediterranean countries, non-alcohol energy intake increased with increasing alcohol consumption; Veenstra et al. (1993) found that non-alcohol energy intake did not differ between alcohol consumption groups in the Netherlands; Mannisto et al. (1997) found lower non-alcohol energy intake among heavy drinkers than among abstainers in Finland (consistent with our findings in men from Central and Northern Europe).\nWe also found that in many centres, male and female higher level drinkers obtained more energy from total fat and protein, and less from simple sugars than did people in lower alcohol consumption categories. The proportion of energy obtained from starch tended to be higher for Mediterranean female higher level drinkers.\nThese findings are borne out by the results of previous studies even if the use of different cutoff points for levels of drinking should be taken into account. Thus, an Italian study found that female heavy drinkers consumed somewhat more fat and less sugar than did other drinking categories ( D'Avanzo et al., 1997 ), and a population-based study in Hawaii ( Le Marchand et al., 1989 ) found that carbohydrate consumption was higher among abstainers, whereas fat consumption was higher among drinkers; this study also observed that male heavy drinkers consumed more protein. In the Nurses' Health Study ( Colditz et al., 1991 ), women drinking a lot of alcohol (25–49 g/day) had low carbohydrate—mainly low sugar—consumption, hence energy from alcohol substituted energy from sugar, whereas among men enroled in the Health Professionals Study, calories from alcohol were added to energy intake from other sources ( Colditz et al., 1991 ). A cross-sectional survey carried out by three French MONICA centres also showed that carbohydrate intake decreased, and protein and fat increased in men as alcohol intake increased ( Ruidavets et al., 2004 ). Finally, a study on Scottish men showed that alcohol consumption was associated with lowered carbohydrate intake, as well as with lower total fat, saturated fat and MUFA ( Thomson et al., 1988 ).\nAlthough beer and wine contain moderate amounts of carbohydrate, the reasons for the persistently lower carbohydrate intake among drinkers are unknown. Results on the relation of fat and protein intake to alcohol intake are much less consistent, possibly because of differences in the methods of assessing and categorizing alcohol intake in the various studies. We used three alcohol consumption categories for women (abstainer, 1–12 g/day and >12 g/day) and four for men (abstainer, 1–12 g/day, 12.1–24 g/day and >24 g/day). The Nurses' Health and Health Professionals studies used six categories of alcohol consumption ( Colditz et al., 1991 ). Other studies defined moderate and heavy drinkers in different ways ( Thomson et al., 1988 ; Veenstra et al., 1993 ).\nWith regard to the dietary instrument, we used a 24-HDR interview, whereas other studies used 7-day weighted records ( Thomson et al., 1988 ), 2-day records ( Veenstra et al., 1993 ), food frequency questionnaires ( Colditz et al., 1991 ; D'Avanzo et al., 1997 ) or diet history ( Thomson et al., 1988 ; Le Marchand et al., 1989 ). The principal limitation of our 24-HDR is that it could not capture day-to-day variations in diet, as only a single measurement was obtained from the study subjects for calibration purposes. This would be problematic if we were trying to assess habitual alcohol intake in individuals. We were, however, interested only in variations in the mean drinking patterns across centres and countries, and this instrument is particularly suited to assess group means. A strength of the 24-HDR, and hence of our study, is that it is a highly standardized, detailed method of collecting data on alcohol consumption and converting it into ethanol, using an ad hoc harmonized nutrient database across countries ( Slimani et al., 2007 ).\nOur study is important for its analysis of places of alcohol consumption and types of beverage consumed in different places. We found that outside the home, men in Northern and Central European centres tended to consume alcohol more at friends' homes than at other places, whereas in Spain, bars were the preferred places of consumption. Among women, alcohol outside the home was generally consumed at friends' homes in all centres, although in Spain and the United Kingdom, consumption in bars was also prominent. As expected, Mediterraneans preferred wine and Northern Europeans preferred beer, regardless of where the drinks were consumed.\nThe GENACIS results on drinking in ‘bars, pubs and discos’ showed, as we did, that the greatest frequency occurs in Spain and the United Kingdom ( Ahlström et al., 2005 ). Similarly, the ECAS (The European Cancer Anaemia) survey showed that drinking in restaurants and bars was most frequent in the United Kingdom (and to a lesser extent in France and Italy), with the lowest frequency occurring in Sweden ( Leifman, 2008 ).\nWith regard to alcohol consumption and BMI, we found that these variables inversely associated in women, in accordance with several other studies ( Jones et al., 1982 ; Gruchow et al., 1985 ; Williamson et al., 1987 ; Kaye et al., 1990 ; Colditz et al., 1991 ; Liu et al., 1994 ; Mannisto et al., 1997 ). In men, some studies have found no relationship between alcohol and BMI ( Colditz et al., 1991 ; Dallongeville et al., 1998 ), but others have found either a direct association ( Fisher and Gordon, 1985 )—as we did for many centres—or an inverse one ( Mannisto et al., 1997 ; Wilsgaard et al., 2005 ).\nOur study also reveals that the educational level of male higher level drinkers was lower than that of abstainers in most Mediterranean centres, but higher in other countries. Among women, this association was less consistent. Regarding the association between high alcohol consumption and education level, studies have shown inconsistent results. Some studies reported education to be negatively associated with heavy alcohol consumption in both genders ( Cummins et al., 1981 ; Knupfer, 1989 ; Hulshof et al., 1991 ; Tejera et al., 1991 ), whereas in other studies, the finding was less consistent for women than for men ( Droomers et al., 1999 ; van Oers et al., 1999 ). As our study revealed the existence of differing geographical patterns, this could be a possible explanation for the inconsistencies found in the literature.\nIt is not possible to extrapolate our findings to other populations as the EPIC cohorts are not representative samples of the populations from which they were drawn; nevertheless, it is interesting that our study revealed clear geographical differences in drinking habits across Europe and shed light on the varying characteristics of different categories of European drinkers.\nTop of page\nConflict of interest\nP Wallström received lecture fees from Prenet AB.

The introduction of the individual electric powertrain provides great capacity for improvement of the vehicle’s energy efficiency and control performance. However, it also poses tremendous challenges concerning vehicle safety, due to the complex system dynamics and cooperation mechanisms between multiactuators.For an electric vehicle with independently controlled motors, because of design and manufacturing factors, the steady-state error of each motor output torque, and the flexibilities and nonlinear backlash of left and right drivetrains, can be different. This results in asymmetrical output characteristics of electric powertrain systems on the same axle. Therefore, during a normal straight-line deceleration, an unexpected yaw moment would be generated, affecting vehicle’s directional stability.In this study, a novel method of directional stability enhancement through robust control of blended braking of an electric vehicle equipped with four individual on-board motors during normal straight-line deceleration are studied. System models, including the vehicle dynamics, tire, electric powertrain, and hydraulic brake models, are developed. Mechanisms of directional instability of the electric vehicle during straight-line braking are analyzed. To further improve the electric vehicle’s safety and performance, robust control algorithm of blended braking is developed using nonlinear sliding mode approach. Simulations of the proposed control strategy is carried out under straight-line braking. The results demonstrate that the developed approach is advantageous over the baseline, with respect to both the directional stability and regeneration efficiency, thus validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the controller synthesis.\nAlso in:\n""","1.0","""http://papers.sae.org/2016-01-1669/""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

(2014). Based on the findings, six potential hazards of ADS-B are identified in this paper. The authors then applied the Probabilistic Safety Assessment approach which includes Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and Importance Analysis methods to quantify the system safety. FTA is applied to measure ADS-B system availability for each identified hazard while Importance Analysis is conducted to identify the most significant failure modes that may lead to the occurrence of the hazards. In addition, risk significance and safety significance of each failure mode are also identified. The result shows that the availability for the ADS-B system as a sole surveillance means is low at 0·898 in comparison to the availability of ADS-B system as supplemental or as primary means of surveillance at 0·95 and 0·999 respectively. The latter availability values are obtained from Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards (MASPS) for Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (DO-242A).\nCOPYRIGHT: © The Royal Institute of Navigation 2017 \nCorresponding author\nHide All\nAli B.

The European Union has set a target to achieve a 10% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 relative to 2005 levels. This target is binding in all the European Union member states. If electric vehicle issues are overcome then the challenge is to use as much renewable energy as possible to achieve this target. In this paper, the impacts of electric vehicle charged in the all-Ireland single wholesale electricity market after the 2020 deadline passes is investigated using a power system dispatch model. For the purpose of this work it is assumed that a 10% electric vehicle target in the Republic of Ireland is not achieved, but instead 8% is reached by 2025 considering the slow market uptake of electric vehicles. Our experimental study shows that the increasing penetration of EVs could contribute to approach the target of the EU and Ireland government on emissions reduction, regardless of different charging scenarios. Furthermore, among various charging scenarios, the off-peak charging is the best approach, contributing 2.07% to the target of 10% reduction of Greenhouse gas emissions by 2025.\nDocuments\nRights statement: Copyright 2015 The Author  This is an open access article published under a Creative Commons Attribution License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the author and source are cited.\nFinal published version, 309 KB, PDF-document\nLinks\n""","8.895931","""http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/impact-of-electric-vehicles-on-a-carbon-constrained-power-systema-post-2020-case-study(4492d015-b884-49c5-aba2-f1d7c29b3367).html""","[-5.934759,54.583863]"

However, it is of considerable difficulties to precisely forecast the undispatchable and intermittent wind and solar power generations. The uncoordinated charging of PEVs imposes further challenges on the unit commitment in modern grid operations. In this paper, all these factors are comprehensively investigated for the first time within a novel hybrid unit commitment framework, namely UCsRP, which considers a wide range of scenarios in renewable generations and demand side management of dispatchable PEVs load. UCsRP is however an extremely challenging optimisation problem not only due to the large scale, mixed integer and nonlinearity, but also due to the double uncertainties relating to the renewable generations and PEV charging and discharging. In this paper, a meta-heuristic solving tool is introduced for solving the UCsRP problem. A key to improve the reliability of the unit commitment is to generate a range of scenarios based on multiple distributions of renewable generations under different prediction errors and extreme predicted value conditions. This is achieved by introducing a novel multi-zone sampling method. A comprehensive study considering four different cases of unit commitment problems with various weather and season scenarios using real power system data are conducted and solved, and smart management of charging and discharging of PEVs are incorporated into the problem. Test results confirm the efficacy of the proposed framework and new solving tool for UCsRP problem. The economic effects of various scenarios are comprehensively evaluated and compared based on the average economic cost index, and several important findings are revealed.\nDOI\nFinal published version\nScopus record\n""","7.3447065","""http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/a-comprehensive-study-of-economic-unit-commitment-of-power-systems-integrating-various-renewable-generations-and-plugin-electric-vehicles(930defe2-c9d4-460e-8334-d1e95df46ffc).html""","[-5.934759,54.583863]"

Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 80. pp. 865-875. ISSN 0040-1625\nFull text not available from this repository.\nAbstract\nWe quantify the conditions that might trigger wide spread adoption of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) to support energy policy. Empirical review shows that early adopters are heterogeneous motivated by financial benefits, environmental appeal, new technology, and vehicle reliability. A probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation model is used to assess consumer heterogeneity for early and mass market adopters. For early adopters full battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are competitive but unable to surpass diesels or hybrids due to purchase price premium and lack of charging availability. For mass adoption, simulations indicate that if the purchase price premium of a BEV closes to within 20% of an in-class internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, combined with a 60% increase in refuelling availability relative to the incumbent system, BEVs become competitive. But this depends on a mass market that values the fuel economy and CO 2 reduction benefits associated with BEVs. We also find that the largest influence on early adoption is financial benefit rather than pro-environmental behaviour suggesting that AFVs should be marketed by appealing to economic benefits combined with pro-environmental behaviour to motivate adoption. Monte Carlo simulations combined with scenarios can give insight into diffusion dynamics for other energy demand-side technologies. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.\nItem Type:\n""","0.988837","""http://publications.eng.cam.ac.uk/571882/""",

It was the aim to investigate possible associations between outdoor air pollution at the residence and the incidence of kidney parenchyma cancer in the general population. We used data from 14 European cohorts from the ESCAPE study. We geocoded and assessed air pollution concentrations at baseline addresses by land-use regression models for particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, PMcoarse, PM2.5 absorbance (soot)) and nitrogen oxides (NO2, NOx), and collected data on traffic. We used Cox regression models with adjustment for potential confounders for cohort-specific analyses and random effects models for meta-analyses to calculate summary hazard ratios (HRs). The 289,002 cohort members contributed 4,111,908 person-years at risk. During follow-up (mean 14.2 years) 697 incident cancers of the kidney parenchyma were diagnosed. The meta-analyses showed higher HRs in association with higher PM concentration, e.g. HR = 1.57 (95%CI: 0.81–3.01) per 5 μg/m3 PM2.5 and HR = 1.36 (95%CI: 0.84–2.19) per 10−5m−1 PM2.5 absorbance, albeit never statistically significant. The HRs in association with nitrogen oxides and traffic density on the nearest street were slightly above one. Sensitivity analyses among participants who did not change residence during follow-up showed stronger associations, but none were statistically significant. Our study provides suggestive evidence that exposure to outdoor PM at the residence may be associated with higher risk for kidney parenchyma cancer; the results should be interpreted cautiously as associations may be due to chance.\n""","0.02648307","""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.30587/abstract""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

As part of this process, the European Union (EU) has indicated several specific issues of concern when considering the chronic effects of long-term exposure to ambient air pollution, especially the effects of fine particulate matter (PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm; PM2.5) on cardiovascular and respiratory health in Europe.\nSubstantial evidence from large studies conducted in the United States ( Krewski et al. 2009 ; Laden et al. 2006 ; Miller et al. 2007 ) and Canada ( Crouse et al. 2012 ) has documented effects of fine particles on natural and cardiopulmonary mortality as the primary end points. Only a limited number of studies have been conducted in Europe ( Andersen et al. 2012 ; Atkinson et al. 2013 ; Brunekreef et al. 2009 ; Filleul et al. 2005 ; Gehring et al. 2006 ), most including only one cohort from a single country, and focusing on the intracohort spatial contrasts rather than on differences across study areas. It is therefore uncertain to what degree the results can be generalized to other areas in Europe. In recent years, some attempts have also been made to investigate the relationship between long-term air pollution exposure and incidence of cerebrovascular disease, providing conflicting evidence ( Andersen et al. 2012 ; Atkinson et al. 2013 ; Krewski et al. 2009 ; Miller et al. 2007 ). Recently, Maaten and Brook (2011) indicated that the relationship “merits further attention on global research and public policy agendas.”\nBiological mechanisms linking long-term air pollution exposure to chronic damage of the cardiovascular system may include endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstriction, increased blood pressure, prothrombotic and coagulant changes, systemic inflammatory and oxidative stress responses, autonomic imbalance and arrhythmias, and the progression of atherosclerosis. On these bases, the American Heart Association delivered a scientific statement concluding that the overall evidence is consistent with PM playing a causal role in cardiac morbidity and mortality ( Brook et al. 2010 ). For cerebrovascular diseases, several studies have indicated the effects of short-term exposures potentially leading to ischemic stroke ( O’Donnell et al. 2011 ; Wellenius et al. 2012 ). However, the evidence of a link between long-term exposure to air pollution and cerebrovascular events is less developed.\nThe European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) project was designed to assess the long-term exposure of the population to air pollution and to investigate exposure–response relationships and thresholds for a number of adverse health outcomes ( ESCAPE 2007 ). Our objective was to estimate the association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution, especially PM mass, black carbon, and nitrogen oxides, and the incidence of stroke in 11 European cohorts. A companion paper focusing on incident coronary events has been recently published ( Cesaroni et al. 2014 ).\nMethods\nStudy population. Individual data were collected for 11 existing cohort studies from Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and Italy. Individuals had been enrolled at different periods, ranging from 1992 to 2007, and were followed until migration, death, or the occurrence of the study outcome until 2006–2010. Baseline individual data included sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, marital status, education, occupation), lifestyle variables (smoking status, smoking intensity and duration, physical activity, alcohol consumption), physiological parameters [body mass index (BMI), cholesterol level], chronic conditions (diabetes, hypertension), and modeled road traffic noise exposure at the residential address. In addition, different area-level socioeconomic variables were collected for each cohort. Finally, if the study area included different degrees of urbanization, a binary “rural” indicator was used to characterize each residential address. (For futher details, see Supplemental Material, Table S1.)\nThe original cohort studies were approved by appropriate institutional medical ethics committees and undertaken in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki ( http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10p​olicies/b3/ ). Each cohort study followed the rules for ethics and data protection set up in the country in which they were based.\nOutcome definition. The identification of first cerebrovascular events during follow-up was accomplished by interview, inspection of medical records and death certificates, or by record linkage with mortality registries and hospital discharge databases. Prevalent cases of either coronary or cerebrovascular disease at baseline were excluded. Methods to define and ascertain prevalent cases differed between the cohorts, as reported in Supplemental Material (“Methods,” pp. 3–13).\nExposure assessment. Long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants at the residential address of each individual was estimated following a three-step procedure. First, PM2.5, PM2.5 absorbance, PM10 (aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) were measured between October 2008 and April 2011 using standardized protocols ( Cyrys et al. 2012 ; Eeftens et al. 2012b ). Coarse PM was calculated as the difference between PM10 and PM2.5. Second, land-use regression (LUR) models were developed for each study area and pollutant ( Beelen et al. 2013a ; Eeftens et al. 2012a ). Third, individual annual exposures were predicted using these models. In addition, traffic intensity on the nearest road (vehicles per day), and traffic load on major roads within a 100-m buffer (product of traffic intensity and length of roads intersecting the buffer) were computed. Noise exposure was assessed locally by calculating the day-evening-night equivalent noise level (Lden) for the most exposed façade of dwellings (see Supplemental Material, “Methods,” pp. 3–13).\nStatistical analysis. We carried out the analyses using a two-stage approach, with cohort-specific analyses in the first stage and random-effects meta-analysis in the second.\nAt the first stage, we fitted Cox proportional hazards regression models in each cohort, with age as the underlying time variable. All analyses were conducted using a common statistical protocol and STATA script (Stata software, version 11; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). We defined adjustment models a priori. We used three degrees of adjustment: a) estimates adjusted only for sex and calendar year of enrollment (model 1); b) adjustment for the shared set of potential individual-level confounders: sex, calendar year, marital status, education, occupational status, smoking status, smoking duration among ever smokers, and smoking intensity among current smokers (model 2); and c) adjustment for the shared set of individual-level confounders (model 2) plus one cohort-specific area-level socioeconomic variable (model 3, also referred to as the “main” model). All confounders were baseline characteristics and were included as fixed covariates in the regression models. Only study participants with no missing information from any of the exposures and confounders in the main model were included in all analyses.\nWe performed a number of additional analyses within each cohort:\nWe addressed the potential effect due to lack of adjustment for relevant cardiovascular risk factors. With this aim, a) we adjusted for intermediate variables only (diabetes and hypertension, available in all the cohorts); b) we adjusted for cardiovascular confounders available in most cohorts [physical activity, alcohol consumption and BMI (available in eight cohorts)]; and c) we added the cholesterol level (available in four cohorts).\nWe added the “rural” indicator to the main model to better account for different degrees of urbanization within the study areas.\nWe evaluated potential confounding by noise.\nWe restricted the analyses to people who never changed address during follow-up.\nWe performed diagnostic tools to check the proportionality-hazard (PH) assumption for the categorical predictors in the main model, and stratified the Cox model for the predictors that did not meet the PH assumption.\nWe evaluated the potential for spatial clustering by running “frailty” models ( Jerrett et al. 2003 ).\nWe evaluated the robustness of the results by excluding the most influential cohort [the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort (DCH)] and by stratifying the cohorts by performance of the LUR model, choosing a cut-off point of 0.6 for the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) R2 coefficient ( Eeftens et al. 2012a ).\nNext, we evaluated a number of individual characteristics considered a priori as potential effect modifiers: sex, age during follow-up (< 60 years, 60–74 years, ≥ 75 years), education, smoking status, BMI (< 25 kg/m2, 25–29 kg/m2, ≥ 30 kg/m2), previous diabetes or hypertension, and residence in rural/urban area.\nFinally, we examined in each cohort the shape of the relationship between each exposure and the study outcome by a) inputting the exposure term as a natural cubic spline with three equally-spaced inner knots, and comparing the model fit of the linear and the spline models, via likelihood-ratio test; and b) implementing “threshold models,” in which threshold concentrations were defined a priori for each exposure, and cohort-specific models were run only on observations with predicted exposures below each threshold in turn.\nIn the second stage of the analysis, we pooled the cohort-specific results by random-effects meta-analysis ( DerSimonian and Laird 1986 ). We evaluated the presence of heterogeneity in the cohort-specific results by applying the chi-square test from Cochran’s Q statistic, which was then quantified by calculating the I2 statistic ( Higgins and Thompson 2002 ). We considered cohort-specific effect estimates to be significantly heterogeneous when I2 was > 50% or the p-value of the chi-square test was < 0.05. Finally, we checked the presence of effect modification across strata of each modifier by meta-analyzing the pooled estimates from the different strata, and by performing the chi-square test of heterogeneity. We considered pooled strata-specific effect estimates to be significantly different when the p-value of the chi-square test was < 0.10.\nWe expressed all results as hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), relative to fixed increments in each exposure, defined a priori: 5 μg/m3 for PM2.5 and coarse PM, 10 μg/m3 for PM10 and NO2, 20 μg/m3 for NOx, 10–5/m for PM2.5 absorbance, 5,000 motor vehicles/day for traffic intensity on the nearest road, and 4,000,000 motor vehicles × meters per day.\nAll first-stage and meta-analyses were fit using the Stata software, version 11 (StataCorp). The frailty and spline models were fit using R software, version 2.15.0 (R Project for Statistical Computing; http://R-project.org ).\nResults\nA total of 111,931 participants were under study. After the exclusion of the prevalent cases and of participants with missing exposure, a total of 105,025 participants remained. However, 5,579 participants had missing information on any of the variables in the main model; therefore, 99,446 participants (88.8% of the original study population, and 92.4% of the original cohorts after exclusion of prevalent cases) were included in the analyses, providing ≥ 1 million person-years of observation. 3,086 incident stroke events were registered during the follow-up. The majority of the stroke cases with defined etiology were coded as ischemic stroke; however, 43% of all cases were undefined, thus precluding the possibility of analyzing different types of stroke separately. The baseline age distribution was heterogeneous across cohorts, with mean values ranging from 44 years (two Italian cohorts) to 74 years (a Swedish cohort), whereas sex, education, and occupation had less variability. The percentage of current smokers at baseline was the highest in southern Europe and the lowest in Sweden and Germany ( Table 1 ). The comparison of the studied population before and after the exclusion of the participants with missing data on the confounders did not show differences in relation to air pollution exposure (i.e., PM2.5) and occurrence of the study outcome.\nTable 1 – Study population: individual baseline characteristics, 11 cohorts.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nA map of the study areas and further details on individual and area-level characteristics are available in Supplemental Material, Figure S1 and Table S1. Exposure levels and ranges were generally higher in Italy than in the other areas ( Table 2 ). More details on air pollution exposures are reported in the Supplemental Material, Tables S2 and S3.\nTable 2 – Study population: environmental exposures at residential address, 11 cohorts.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nThe main PM2.5 results were robust to confounding adjustment and to model specification as found in extensive sensitivity analyses ( Table 4 ). There were no relevant departures from the results of the main model after adjusting for intermediate variables, additional cardiovascular risk factors, and “rural” indicator or noise coexposure, or when stratified Cox models were implemented on the predictors that did not meet the PH assumption. Also, the results did not change when spatial autocorrelation was accounted for with “frailty” models (data not shown). We found marked differences in the PM2.5 associations with incident stroke depending on the precision of the cohort-specific LUR models in predicting individual PM2.5, with a significant estimate in the six cohorts with LOOCV R2 coefficients > 0.6 (HR = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.30, 2.35), and no association in the other five cohorts (HR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.70, 1.13).\nTable 4 – Association between PM2.5 exposure and stroke incidence in the 11 cohorts under study: results of the sensitivity analyses.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nThe results of the effect modification analysis are reported in Figure 1 , together with the p-values for heterogeneity across the pooled strata-specific estimates. There was a suggestion of effect modification by age (p = 0.09), with a null effect at < 60 years (563 cases; HR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.18) and higher effects in the 60- to 74-year range (1,960 cases; HR = 1.22; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.61) and ≥ 75 years (563 cases; HR = 1.62; 95% CI: 0.91, 2.90) categories. The hazard ratio for those ≥ 60 years was 1.40 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.87) with little evidence of heterogeneity in the cohort-specific estimates (I2 = 25.8%; pheterogeneity = 0.20, data not shown). Never-smokers had a significantly higher estimate of PM2.5 on the risk of incident stroke, with an increased risk of 74% (HR = 1.74; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.88).\nFigure 1 – Association between PM2.5 exposure and stroke incidence in the 11 cohorts under study: results of the effect modification analysis. Values are HRs and 95% CIs per 5-μg/m3 increases in PM2.5. p-Values of effect modification (right) were calculated as heterogeneity tests among coefficients in different strata of the effect modifiers.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nThe results from threshold models are reported in Table 5 . We chose three exposure thresholds a priori: 25 μg/m3 (the current air quality limit value for annual average PM2.5 concentration in Europe), 20 μg/m3, and 15 μg/m3. The association between PM2.5 < 20 μg/m3 and incident stroke was high and borderline significant (HR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.68) for the nine cohorts with individuals below such concentrations. For the seven cohorts with PM2.5 concentrations below all the chosen thresholds, there was a 33% increased risk of incident stroke (HR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.77) for each 5-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5. The comparison of the linear and spline models suggested the linear shape of the concentration–response function as a good approximation for most of the cohorts (data not shown).\nTable 5 – Association between PM2.5 exposure and stroke incidence in subsets of the 11 cohorts under study: results of the threshold analyses.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nDiscussion\nIn this first multicenter European study on long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and stroke incidence, we found suggestive evidence of an association between PM2.5 exposure and stroke incidence, although the main estimate did not reach statistical significance. The results were robust to confounding adjustment and model specification. Stronger associations were estimated among participants ≥ 60 years old, never-smokers, and when all participants exposed to PM2.5 concentrations > 20 μg/m3 were removed from the analysis.\nMost of the evidence on the effects of air pollution on stroke comes from time-series studies of cerebrovascular or stroke mortality ( Maynard et al. 2007 ; O’Donnell et al. 2011 ; Wellenius et al. 2012 ). Evidence from previous studies on long-term effects is conflicting ( Maaten and Brook 2011 ). The Women’s Health Initiative cohort study ( Miller et al. 2007 ) found a 28% increased risk of stroke incidence in women (HR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.61) per 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, which is similar to the estimate of the present study, 38% excess risk for 10-μg/m3 PM2.5 increments. In contrast, previous analyses of the American Cancer Society cohort ( Krewski et al. 2009 ) and of a Norwegian cohort ( Nafstad et al. 2004 ) failed to identify effects of air pollution on stroke mortality. More recently, a large prospective study conducted within the DCH cohort (which also contributes to the present analysis) detected a borderline significant association between NO2 and incident stroke (HR = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.11, per 5.7-μg/m3 increase in NO2) ( Andersen et al. 2012 ). In the present study, there was no association between long-term NO2 exposure and incident stroke in the DCH cohort. It should be considered that there are differences in the results reported from the DCH cohort: First, the whole cohort including the two largest cities in Denmark, Aarhus, and Copenhagen, contributed to the previous analysis, for a total of 52,215 participants, whereas only the Copenhagen part of the cohort was included in the present study (36,215 participants); second, the exposure assessment was different, because a dispersion model was used in the first analysis, with NO2 exposure assessed all the way back to 1971 and the mean from 1971 until the end of follow-up was used. A recent study in the United Kingdom found no relationship between long-term air pollution exposure and stroke incidence ( Atkinson et al. 2013 ).\nWe noted significant heterogeneity in association estimates for most exposures. With the exception of the KORA (German Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) cohort, all of the younger cohorts had point estimates for HRs, although nonsignificant, ≤ 1. When we restricted the study population to those ≥ 60 years of age, in light of the results of effect modification analyses suggesting the lowest risk is for those < 60 years of age and the highest for those > 74 years of age, we found that the heterogeneity was reduced (from I2 = 49.2%, pheterogeneity = 0.032 for all ages, to I2 = 25.8%, pheterogeneity = 0.20) and the increased relative risk was borderline statistically significant. Therefore, the different age composition of the cohorts seems to be the most plausible interpretation for the heterogeneity. However, it should be considered that a correlation was present between age and various characteristics of the cohorts (prevalence of smoking, quality of the LUR models, levels of air pollution exposures, and quality of the outcome assessment) with older cohorts having lower smoking rates, higher LUR LOOCV R2 coefficients, lower PM2.5 levels, and stroke ascertainment based on expert medical record review in addition to mortality and hospitalization databases. It is therefore likely that any combination of these factors, not only age, might have been responsible for the heterogeneity in the associations across cohorts that we found. In addition, this is the most likely explanation for the stronger associations at lower exposure levels (< 20 μg/m3 PM2.5), for the cohorts with the highest LOOCV R2 coefficients, better case ascertainment, and for the result among never-smokers.\nIn any case, the result for never-smokers is relevant because it indicates limited possibility of residual confounding from smoking and that the relative effect of ambient air pollution on stroke incidence is more easily detectable in the absence of a strong risk factor for stroke, such as active smoking.\nA few limitations of the present study should be mentioned. First, air pollution measurement campaigns were implemented between 2008 and 2011, after the follow-up period of most cohorts ( Cyrys et al. 2012 ; Eeftens et al. 2012b ). As a consequence, this study relies on the assumption that the intracohort spatial distribution of air pollution has not dramatically changed in the last 10–15 years and that the land-use model predictions are thus representative of the baseline spatial contrasts for all the cohorts investigated. Several studies in the literature support this assumption over periods of about 10 years ( Cesaroni et al. 2012 ; Eeftens et al. 2011 ). In addition, within the ESCAPE project many efforts were made to back-extrapolate air pollution concentrations, taking into account long-term time trends (see Supplemental Material, “Methods,” pp. 3–13), and analyses relating back-extrapolated data to the health outcomes showed no clear differences in the results compared with original data (data not shown). We also performed an exploratory analysis to evaluate whether the association between PM2.5 and stroke incidence differed according to accrual time, under the hypothesis that the assumption of stable spatial distribution of air pollution over time could be more valid for more recent cohorts: We did not find meaningful differences in the association estimates across cohorts according to accrual time (data not shown). Second, our approach exploited only within-study area contrasts, which limited the exposure contrast, but decreased the risk of potential confounding when comparing diverse cohorts from different countries. Third, the data available to adjust for confounding were somewhat different from cohort to cohort, allowing the possibility of different degrees of residual confounding in the cohort-specific results. However, the most relevant cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, diabetes or hypertension, BMI, physical activity) were available in almost all the cohorts, and thus severe bias in the effect estimates due to residual confounding is unlikely. Finally, we did not consider the possible impact of loss to follow-up (drop out or death) on the findings. Air pollution exposure is an established cause of mortality, so that older participants are likely to represent a population that is “selected” such that those who sustained higher exposures are more likely to have characteristics (genetic or otherwise) that place them at lower risk for stroke, resulting in underestimation of the causal relation of exposure with stroke risk. However, given the small relative risk of the air pollution–mortality association (i.e., HR < 1.10 for 5-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 or 10-μg/m3 increase in PM10 or NO2 as reported by Beelen et al. 2013b ), this underestimation is likely to be small.\nThis study has several strengths. The exposure assessment, one of the most critical aspects of this kind of study, was performed in a rigorous way with standardized procedures across all study areas ( Cyrys et al. 2012 ; Eeftens et al. 2012b ). The LOOCV R2 coefficients from the PM2.5 LUR models ranged from 0.53 in Finland to 0.79 in Germany (Ruhr area), denoting strong discriminatory power of the spatial attributes used in these models to capture the spatial contrasts of exposures within the study areas ( Eeftens et al. 2012a ). An additional point of merit is the extensive list of variables available for confounding adjustment, including cardiovascular mediators and confounders, road traffic noise exposure at each residence and the urban/rural indicator used to characterize the degree of urbanization of each study area. Also, the statistical modeling was rigorously standardized between cohorts and addressed several methodological issues, including the potential for spatial autocorrelation of the study outcomes, and the linearity of the relationship between long-term air pollution exposure and stroke incidence.\nConclusions\nIn summary, we found suggestive evidence of an association between long-term exposure to fine particles and stroke incidence in 11 European cohorts, especially among participants ≥ 60 years of age and among never-smokers. The association was also observed below current European limit values, indicating harmful effects of fine particles even at low concentrations.\nReferences\nAndersen ZJ, Kristiansen LC, Andersen KK, Olsen TS, Hvidberg M, Jensen SS, et al. 2012.

First, direct calculations between these variables were undertaken. Thereafter, a variant of the method of quasi-induced exposure (a ratio of culpable versus nonculpable accidents in the population) was used and referred to as the indirect method. These methods yielded fairly similar results, given that the samples used were drawn from the same population but only partly overlapping. It was found that experience had the strongest effect on accidents in the first year of driving, while age had a u-shaped association with accidents, that is, young and old drivers had more accidents, something that was more apparent when experience was held constant. These results show that, for bus drivers, experience is initially more important than age, but after two or three years, the effect is small. Thereafter, age is the more discernible variable, although it is a very weak factor in predicting crash risk.\nArticles related to the one you are viewing\nCiting Literature\nNumber of times cited: 9\n1\nMohammad Mehdi Besharati, Ali Tavakoli Kashani, Factors contributing to intercity commercial bus drivers' crash involvement risk, Archives of Environmental & Occupational Health, 2017, 0\nCrossRef\n2\nQuang Ngoc La, Dat Van Duong, Andy H.

I apply this integrative framework to the diffusion (and non-diffusion) of electric vehicles and the process of electric mobility. I begin by presenting my methods, namely semi-structured qualitative research interviews with social theorists. Then, I present the three theories deemed most relevant by respondents. Automobility holds that, on a cultural or social level, automobiles exist as part of a complex, one that involves hardware and infrastructure—a hybridity between drivers and machines—along with patterns of identity and attitudes about driving pleasure. Actor Network Theory (ANT) involves the concepts of network assemblage, translation, enrollment, and actants and lieutenants. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, or UTAUT, states that on an individual level, the adoption of new technologies will be predicated on interconnected factors such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and other facilitating conditions. Based largely on the original interview data supplemented with peer-reviewed studies, I propose a conceptual framework of user acceptance consisting of motile pleasure, sociality, sociotechnical commensurability, and habitual momentum. I conclude with implications for research and policy.\nItem Type:\n""","10.512293","""http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/66978/""","[-0.087076,50.86447]"

The introduction of the individual electric powertrain provides great capacity for improvement of the vehicle’s energy efficiency and control performance. However, it also poses tremendous challenges concerning vehicle safety, due to the complex system dynamics and cooperation mechanisms between multiactuators.For an electric vehicle with independently controlled motors, because of design and manufacturing factors, the steady-state error of each motor output torque, and the flexibilities and nonlinear backlash of left and right drivetrains, can be different. This results in asymmetrical output characteristics of electric powertrain systems on the same axle. Therefore, during a normal straight-line deceleration, an unexpected yaw moment would be generated, affecting vehicle’s directional stability.In this study, a novel method of directional stability enhancement through robust control of blended braking of an electric vehicle equipped with four individual on-board motors during normal straight-line deceleration are studied. System models, including the vehicle dynamics, tire, electric powertrain, and hydraulic brake models, are developed. Mechanisms of directional instability of the electric vehicle during straight-line braking are analyzed. To further improve the electric vehicle’s safety and performance, robust control algorithm of blended braking is developed using nonlinear sliding mode approach. Simulations of the proposed control strategy is carried out under straight-line braking. The results demonstrate that the developed approach is advantageous over the baseline, with respect to both the directional stability and regeneration efficiency, thus validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the controller synthesis.\nAlso in:\n""","10.512293","""http://papers.sae.org/2016-01-1669/""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

Furthermore, safety metrics are paramount in the measurement of the impact of new operational procedures or technical improvements in the air traffic control system. The study presented in this paper introduces three safety metrics (reaction time performance indicator, time to closest point of approach performance indicator, and time to closest point of approach critical limit ratio) derived from a given airspace and a sizable, assorted traffic sample extracted from traffic surveillance track data. The metrics are used to characterize the airspace as a function of the safety outcome, which can be continuously overseen. The final goal of the safety metrics is to be used as an airspace safety warning system, where precursory metrics would signal the need to act to maintain the air traffic control system safety target in the face of operational, organizational, technical, or legal changes.\n""","1.417728","""https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29AS.1943-5525.0000796""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

The fetus and infant are particularly vulnerable to such potential hazards ( Barouki et al. 2012 ; Gluckman and Hanson 2004 ; Hines et al. 2010 ). Environmental exposures—preconceptionally, in utero, and during early life—may permanently change the body’s structure, physiology, and metabolism ( Gluckman and Hanson 2004 ). Such changes can promote disease long after the environmental exposure has occurred, including across generations. Environmental exposures during fetal or early life have been associated with adverse fetal growth and with developmental neurotoxic, immunotoxic, and obesogenic effects in children; but for many of these associations, evidence has been classified as limited or inadequate (e.g., Bellinger 2013 ; Gascon et al. 2013a ; La Merrill and Birnbaum 2011 ; Wigle et al. 2008 ). Neurodevelopmental disabilities, obesity, and asthma are common and highly complex chronic pathologies, and it is hypothesized that improved understanding of how simultaneous environmental risk factors interact among themselves, with individual characteristics (e.g., genetics), and with epigenetics, can help elucidate their causes ( Bousquet et al. 2011 ; Gallagher et al. 2011 ; Trasande et al. 2009 ; Van den Bergh 2011 ). Up to now, the field of environment and child health has almost uniquely focused on single exposure–health effect relationships; there is no global view of how various types of exposures co-exist and jointly affect health.\nThe exposome. The “exposome” concept was first proposed by Wild (2005) to encompass the totality of human environmental (i.e., nongenetic) exposures from conception onward, complementing the genome; it was developed “to draw attention to the critical need for more complete environmental exposure data in epidemiological studies” ( Wild 2012 ). In this concept, the exposome contains several overlapping domains of nongenetic factors contributing to disease risk, including a general external domain (social, societal, urban environment, climate factors), a specific external domain (specific contaminants, lifestyle factors, tobacco, occupation), and an internal environment (metabolism, gut microflora, inflammation, oxidative stress) ( Wild 2012 ). The exposome calls for improvement of often uncertain exposure data, for integration of data on biological mechanisms, and for a more holistic exposure approach in epidemiological studies. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the exposome may serve an important purpose in characterizing not only the complex mixtures of already identified exposures but also, through its untargeted approach and the use of high-throughput “omics” techniques, relevant exposures that have thus far remained unidentified ( Rappaport 2011 ; Rappaport and Smith 2010 ). There are large challenges in developing the exposome concept into a workable approach, including the consideration of multiple, longitudinal time periods of interest and of temporal variability, the acknowledgement of exposure uncertainty in an exposome study, the integration of omics data, and the development of powerful statistical techniques to analyze the associations between exposome data and adverse health end points.\nThe HELIX (Human Early-Life Exposome) project has as its general aim to implement tools and methods (biomarkers, omics-based approaches, remote sensing and GIS-based spatial methods, personal exposure devices, statistical tools for combined exposures, and burden of disease methodologies), to characterize early-life exposure to a wide range of chemical and physical environmental factors and associate these with data on major child health outcomes (growth and obesity, neurodevelopment, respiratory health), thus developing an “early-life exposome” approach. The project takes pregnancy and childhood periods (“early life”) as the starting point for developing the life-course exposome. In this review we describe the general design of HELIX and its main challenges. In this manner, we aim to illustrate how the exposome concept may be implemented in a feasible epidemiological study design.\nProject Concept, Objectives, and Study Populations\nHELIX will develop the early-life exposome approach and database in three overlapping steps containing six research areas ( Figure 1 ). A first step will measure the external exposome exposure estimates for a broad range of chemical and physical exposures; a second step will measure the internal exposome (molecular signatures) and integrate the multiple dimensions of the exposome (multiple exposures, multiple time points, individual variability); and a third step will develop the tools and methods to evaluate the exposome’s impact on child health ( Figure 1 ). The project is based in six existing population-based birth cohort studies in Europe ( Figure 2 ). Objectives are the following:\nFigure 1 – HELIX conceptual framework and interactions between research areas.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nStep 1: Measuring the external exposome:\nTo obtain estimates of exposure to persistent and nonpersistent pollutants in food, consumer products, water, and indoor air, during pregnancy and in childhood.\nTo obtain estimates of chemical and physical exposures in the outdoor environment during pregnancy and in childhood: ambient air pollution, ambient noise, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, temperature, and built environment/green space.\nStep 2: Integrating the external and internal exposome:\nTo define multiple exposure patterns in the individual and outdoor environment, describe their predictors, and describe uncertainties and variability in the exposures assessed.\nTo measure molecular signatures associated with environmental exposures through analysis of profiles of metabolites, proteins, transcripts, and DNA methylation in biological samples from the children in the cohorts. Biological pathway analyses will be used to inform analyses of the relationship between multiple exposures and child health.\nStep 3: Impact of the early-life exposome on child health:\nTo develop a novel multistep statistical approach for the analysis of the association of patterns of multiple and combined exposures and child health outcomes, using agnostic environment-wide association study (EWAS) analysis, structural equation modeling (SEM), and Bayesian profile regression.\nTo provide exposure–response estimates for the association of multiple and combined exposures with child health, focusing on fetal and childhood growth and obesity, neurodevelopment, and respiratory health.\nTo estimate the burden of common childhood diseases that may be attributed to multiple environmental exposures in Europe.\nTo strengthen the knowledge base for European policy in the area of child and environmental health by engaging with, and effectively disseminating HELIX knowledge to stakeholders including those responsible for risk management and mitigation and prevention strategies.\nThe birth cohorts. Six existing longitudinal population-based birth cohort studies in Europe form the basis of the project: BiB (Born in Bradford; United Kingdom) ( Wright et al. 2013 ), EDEN (Étude des Déterminants pré et postnatals du développement et de la santé de l’ENfant; France) ( Drouillet et al. 2009 ), INMA (INfancia y Medio Ambiente; Spain) ( Guxens et al. 2012 ), KANC (Kaunus Cohort; Lithuania) ( Grazuleviciene et al. 2009 ), MoBa (Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study; Norway) ( Magnus et al. 2006 ), and Rhea (Greece) ( Chatzi et al. 2009 ) ( Figure 2 ). The cohorts were selected because a) they each have a large set of existing longitudinal data from early pregnancy through childhood; b) they can implement new follow-up examinations of the children at similar ages (6–9 years), old enough for accurate measurement of the phenotypes of interest for HELIX; and c) they can integrate new questionnaires, biosampling, and clinical examinations in their new follow-ups using common protocols. The cohorts have worked together intensively and have pooled data as part of other European Community (EC) projects ( Larsen et al. 2013 ; Vrijheid et al. 2012 ; see also Supplemental Material, Previous EU projects contributing data and expertise to HELIX, pp. 2–3). The selection of cohorts followed a strategy to obtain data in different regions of Europe.\nStudy populations. In general, exposure estimates can be obtained in cohort studies for very large numbers of subjects by exposure models and questionnaires, whereas exposure and omics biomarkers can, for cost reasons, be obtained only in smaller numbers of subjects. Assessment of individual exposure variability and validation of exposure models require very intensive data collection that is feasible only in an even smaller number of subjects. For these reasons, HELIX uses a multilevel study design, drawing on nested study populations for four different levels of data collection ( Figure 3 ), as follows:\nFigure 3 – Study design, study populations, and data sources.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nThe entire six cohorts comprising 32,000 mother–child pairs will form the basis of existing data. From this study population we will use existing exposure data such as tobacco use, ESCAPE (European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects) air pollution land-use regression (LUR) models ( Eeftens et al. 2012 ), water disinfection by-products (DBPs) exposure models from the HiWate project (Health Impacts of long-term exposure to disinfection byproducts in drinking water) ( Nieuwenhuijsen et al. 2009 ), confounder data, and outcome data. Outdoor exposure estimates (research area 2, below) will be applied to these entire cohorts. Risk estimates for the effects of combined outdoor exposures (the “outdoor exposome”) on child health will be obtained in this study population. Harmonization of the existing data will build on protocols and expertise developed in earlier collaborative EC projects ( Bousquet et al. 2011 ; Eeftens et al. 2012 ; Larsen et al. 2013 ; Vrijheid et al. 2012 ; see also Supplemental Material, Previous EU projects contributing data and expertise to HELIX, pp. 2–3). Outcomes that can be harmonized across cohorts include birth outcomes; postnatal growth and body mass index (BMI); self reported wheezing, doctor-diagnosed asthma, and measures of lung function; and neurodevelopment harmonized as five neurodevelopmental constructs (general cognition, language development, motor abilities, socioemotional behavior, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptomatology) across different age groupings.\n.\nA HELIX subcohort of 1,200 mother–child pairs ( Figure 3 ) will be fully characterized for the external and internal exposome, including exposure biomarkers during pregnancy and childhood and omics biomarkers during childhood. The impact of the total early-life exposome on child health will be characterized in these 1,200 mother–child pairs. The 1,200 mother–child pairs will be nested within the entire cohorts by selection of 200 pairs from each cohort. Eligibility criteria include a) age 6–9 years, 7–8 years, if possible; the age range should be as narrow as possible for comparability of omics analyses and exposure-related behavior; b) stored pregnancy blood and urine samples available, and available sample volume sufficient for the analysis of exposure biomarkers detailed in research area 1; c) complete address history available from first to last follow-up point; d) no serious health problems that, in the opinion of a local clinician, may affect the performance of the clinical testing (e.g., spirometry) or affect the volunteer’s safety (e.g., renal failure, pneumonia). In addition, the selection will consider whether data on important covariates (genetic data, diet, socioeconomic factors) are available. Cohorts with more than the required number of mother–child pairs that meet these criteria will invite subjects at random from the eligible pool. The new follow-up examination will include the collection of new biological samples suitable for all planned biomarker and omics analyses (research areas 1 and 4, below). The collection of two urine samples (one before bedtime and one first morning void) will better capture short-lived biomarker metabolites and provide more stable metabolome coverage than would be achieved with one spot urine sample. Collected blood samples will be processed into appropriate matrices (including whole blood, serum, and plasma) and storage media (for RNA and DNA extraction), and will be rapidly deep frozen under optimized and standardized processing procedures. Variables that can affect omics profiles, such as use of drugs, time of last meal, or physical exercise, will be collected. Trained nurses will carry out health examinations of the children. Examinations include measurements of weight, height, waist circumference, skin folds, blood pressure, and spirometry, and will follow standard operating procedures. Standardized computer-assisted interviews with the mothers will collect information on exposure sources (smoking, cooking, heating, water consumption), physical activity, time activity, diet, social factors, stress, and asthma and allergy. Neurodevelopmental outcomes will be assessed through a battery of internationally standardized, nonlinguistic, and culturally blind computer tests [n-back ( Vuontela et al. 2003 ), Attention Network Test ( Rueda et al. 2004 ), Trail Making Test ( Lezak 2004 ), Raven ( Raven et al. 1998 )]. Parents will complete the Conners Comprehensive Behavior Rating Scales ( Conners 1997 ) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach and Rescorla 2000 ) questionnaires to assess child behavioral problems. Besides the standardization of procedures and questionnaires, the project will implement data collection QA/QC (quality assurance/quality control) through the central training of nurses and field workers—including training workshops with harmonization and reliability exercises (e.g., for the skinfold measurements)—and through visits of coordinators to the local cohorts during the fieldwork to monitor adherence to the standard operating procedures.\n.\nPanel studies ( Figure 3 ) will collect data on short-term temporal variability in exposure biomarkers and omics biomarkers, on individual behaviors (physical activity, mobility, time activity), and on personal and indoor exposures. A “Child Panel Study” ( Figure 3 ) will include children from the HELIX subcohort (n = 150; 25 from each cohort) and will thus be based on the same inclusion criteria. An added requirement for the panel study is that children must be able to wear equipment without destroying it. Invitations will be sent to all families included in the subcohort; but because of the intensive monitoring involved, it is expected that only the most cooperative families will agree to participate, so randomness cannot be guaranteed. Detailed information allowing discussion if the panel study differs from the larger groups will be available. A “Pregnancy Panel Study” ( Figure 3 ) will include 150 pregnant women, 50 from three of the regions under study, and these will be volunteer women from outside the cohorts; mothers from the cohorts cannot be used for this purpose because their pregnancies occurred several years previously. Criteria for inclusion are singleton pregnancy, age ≥ 18 years at the time of start of pregnancy, first visit to be conducted before week 20 of the pregnancy, and residence in the study area covered by the cohort. Study areas will be defined, taking into account the availability of fine-scale air pollution models; as far as possible the areas should correspond to the study areas of the original cohorts, or at least cover similar areas.\nSubjects in the two panel studies will be followed for 1 week in two seasons. From these subjects we will collect daily urine samples—first morning and last nighttime voids, and from the pregnant women an additional midday void if possible. At the end of each monitoring week, blood samples will be collected following the same procedures as for the subcohort. Subjects or their mothers will complete diaries to collect information on meal times, cosmetics and medication use, and urination frequency for input into the physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models (described under research area 1, below). The subjects will carry smartphones and personal monitors, and indoor air and noise monitors will be installed in the homes (research area 2). Additional QA/QC procedures in the panel studies will ensure that the two monitoring periods follow the same procedures in all cohorts and that blood is collected at approximately the same time of the day and under the same conditions in both periods and in all cohorts. This is important to reduce variability in the omics analyses.\n.\nHealth impacts for the larger European population will then be estimated using the exposure levels and dose–response relations from HELIX ( Figure 3 ), together with dose–response and threshold estimates from the literature and prevalence data from European registries and birth cohorts ( Vrijheid et al. 2012 ).\nMeasuring the External Exposome\nAccurate assessment of environmental exposures (reduction of exposure misclassification) remains an important outstanding challenge for health risk and impact assessment. In developing the exposome concept, this challenge is multiplied because it requires obtaining exposure data for many different exposures. Within the external exposome, a distinction can be made between largely individually assessed exposures such as ETS, water contaminants, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), pesticides, and metals, which are traditionally assessed through questionnaires and/or biomonitoring on an individual basis, and exposures in the outdoor environment such as outdoor air pollutants and noise, where, so far, the residence is taken for estimation of exposure, ignoring mobility.\nResearch area 1: individual exposures. Individually assessed exposures can vary on an hourly or daily to yearly basis. Temporal variability is particularly high for exposures with a short biological half-life and little constancy in the underlying exposure behavior [e.g., bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, organophosporous pesticides ( Bradman et al. 2013 ; Braun et al. 2011 ; Philippat et al. 2013 ; Preau et al. 2010 )]. For such exposures, intra- compared with interindividual variability is known to be high, and only many repeat measurements over time may give improved exposure estimates. For more persistent exposures, biomarkers give more long-term exposure estimates that are influenced by changes in diet or behavior, for example, by breastfeeding patterns. Research area 1 will measure exposure biomarkers in the subcohort (n = 1,200) in appropriate biological samples newly collected from the children and previously collected from mothers during pregnancy. Biomarkers include POPS—PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs)—in blood samples, nonpersistent chemicals—phthalates, phenols, organophosphate pesticides—in urine samples, metals in blood, and cotinine as a biomarker of ETS exposure ( Table 1 ). Pre- and postnatal questionnaires will collect information on water consumption habits, which will be combined with information on concentrations of DBPs in drinking water from water companies to obtain estimates of exposure to DBPs. Questionnaires will also collect information on sources of indoor air pollution including ETS, cooking and heating appliances, and ventilation ( Table 1 ). In the panel studies, indoor air pollution will be measured to characterize errors when using exposure information from questionnaires and models. This will be done using passive samplers for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylene, and xylene), and active PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter ≤ 2.5 μm) cyclone pumps, installed in the home. The panel studies will measure daily repeat biomarkers of the nonpersistent chemicals (phthalates, phenols, organophosphate pesticides) in urine ( Table 1 ); these data will be used to characterize inter- and intraindividual variability in these urine biomarkers, and where possible, correct for the uncertainties in the larger cohort.\nTable 1 – Individual exposures.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nOne further source of uncertainty in exposure estimates based on biomarker concentrations is their relationship to the internal biologically effective dose ( Sobus et al. 2011 ). The measured biomarker concentration cannot always be considered as a steady-state concentration (particularly for nonpersistent chemicals), nor as a surrogate for the internal dose of the target tissue and has often not been sampled during the entire critical time window ( Bartell et al. 2004 ; Clewell et al. 2008 ). Here, modeling the toxicokinetics of the chemical using PBPK may help the interpretation of the measured biomarker data. PBPK models describe the fate of chemicals in the body using individual-specific information about the physiology (age, sex, weight) and the biochemistry (enzyme content) of the individual as well as information on the individual’s behavior (breastfeeding, physical activity, diet) ( Beaudouin et al. 2010 ). In the context of population (epidemiological) studies, PBPK models can be used to simulate exposure during critical time periods in between biomarker measurement points (e.g., Gascon et al. 2013b ; Lyons et al. 2008 ; Ulaszewska et al. 2012 ). To be relevant, this approach requires detailed input data on individual characteristics and behaviors to minimize assumptions and uncertainties. HELIX will evaluate the use of PBPK modeling to interpret biomarkers of exposure to PFASs [perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)]. For the PFASs, we propose to relate the biomarker measurement in the child to that in the mother during pregnancy using an exposure scenario that integrates maternal–fetal transfers during pregnancy, transfers via breast milk, and diet during childhood. For DEHP, repeat biomarkers in the panel studies and information on exposure-related behaviors and urination times will be used to evaluate the predictable value of different numbers of biomarker measurements.\nResearch area 2: outdoor exposures. For exposures that are traditionally assessed on the basis of residential location, such as outdoor air pollutants, noise and the built environment, major improvements in exposure assessment and reduction in measurement error can be achieved by collecting information on time–space activity, and, in the case of air pollution, on how much air a person inhales. Knowledge on physical activity, which constitutes a proxy of the inhalation rate ( Kawahara et al. 2011 ), for example, may be integrated with personal air pollution measurements to estimate inhalation dose. New geographic information system (GIS)–based exposure assessments ( Beelen et al. 2013 ; Eeftens et al. 2012 ), remote sensing ( Dadvand et al. 2012 ), and smartphone technologies ( de Nazelle et al. 2013 ) have made it easier to assess outdoor exposures, and to integrate personal mobility and physical activity data.\nResearch area 2 will construct a GIS environment for the six cohorts, and will assign exposure estimates for air pollutants, noise, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, temperature, built environment/green spaces. The estimates will build on existing LUR air pollution maps ( Beelen et al. 2013 ; Eeftens et al. 2012 ), noise maps, UV index and METEOSAT data, green space estimates, as well as walkability, building density, and bike lane map information for the built environment ( Table 2 ). Data from existing regulatory monitors and remote sensing data (e.g., from the Tropospheric Emission Monitoring Internet Service; http://www.temis.nl/ ) will be used to inform ambient spatial exposure models. The aim is to obtain average exposure estimates for the pregnancy period, and during childhood for different time periods, including 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 1 year before the outcome and omics assessment. Smartphones will be worn by the participants in the panel studies to provide geolocation data every second and the metabolic equivalent of tasks (METs) every 10 sec, derived from the built-in accelerometer and GPS (global positioning system) and integrated on the specially developed ExpoApp (Ateknea Solutions Catalonia S.A., Barcelona, Spain). We will then translate these data into activity type (resting, cycling, car travel) and derive inhalation rates. The panel study subjects will also wear electronic wrist band UV dosimeters ( Seckmeyer et al. 2011 ), PM2.5 active samplers (DCG4004 sampling pump with GK.05SH Cyclone inlet; BGI Instruments, Waltham, MA, USA), and MicroAthelometers (AE-51; Envirodata, Madrid, Spain) for continuous black carbon monitoring ( Table 2 ). Personal exposure estimates will be used to characterize uncertainties in the spatial exposure models.\nTable 2 – Outdoor exposures.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nIntegrating the External and Internal Exposome\nResearch area 3: integrating exposures. Once individual and outdoor exposures have been estimated, research area 3 will use analysis-of-variance techniques, incorporating data from both the HELIX subcohort and the panel studies, to understand the variance components for each key exposure (e.g., arising from diet, physical activity, or time of sampling) and describe the uncertainties in each of the exposure estimates. Statistical techniques such as factor analysis and latent class analysis will be used to create a reduced set of continuous exposure indices based on commonly occurring exposures, while individuals who share similar exposure profiles or “exposomes” will be defined. We will then determine the influence of variables such as diet, socioeconomic status, study region, and seasonality on these exposure indices or profiles. Specific attention will be given to the detection of cohort-specific exposure patterns.\nResearch area 4: integrating molecular exposure signatures. High-throughput molecular biology “omics” techniques (such as metabolomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics) have important potential for broad and untargeted characterization of the internal exposome ( Ellis et al. 2012 ; Hebels et al. 2013 ). Here, the interest is in the identification of exposure biomarkers and mechanistic pathways. Research area 4 will determine molecular signatures associated with environmental exposures through the measurement of endogenous and xenobiotic metabolite profiles in blood and urine, proteins in plasma, and coding and small noncoding RNAs (including miRNAs; microRNAs) and DNA methylation in whole blood. Omics tools will be employed mainly in the subcohort of 1,200 children with newly collected biosamples at 6–9 years of age; the use of new samples ensures comparability between techniques and cohorts ( Figure 4 , Table 3 ; see also Supplemental Material, Detailed description of omics techniques to be used in HELIX, pp. 4–6). The use of a similar time point for all omics techniques also allows integration of the different techniques during data analysis. Genotyping is available already in most of the cohorts and will be completed where needed. Two main limitations in epidemiological studies aiming to use omics biomarkers are tissue and intraindividual variability. Omics profiles are tissue specific, and the tissue of interest can usually not be obtained (e.g., adipose tissue, brain tissue). The focus of HELIX is thus on markers in systemic biological samples (blood, urine) to evaluate the use of omics biomarkers as markers of exposure changes in (larger) epidemiological studies. Omics profiles change over time in the same person; a cross-omics paper with three repeat analyses in 16 subjects over 1 month showed that intraindividual variability for metabolomics and transcriptomics was found to be lower than interindividual variability for almost all the biomarkers ( Gruden et al. 2012 ). However, some sets of markers were highly variable within the same subject and thus cannot be used directly in epidemiological studies. Further, longer time periods of 1 month are likely to give higher intraindividual variability. HELIX will make some progress toward characterizing intra- and interindividual variability in the metabolomics and transcriptomics markers by analyzing repeat biological samples collected in the panel studies in different seasons.\nFigure 4 – Timeline of the omics analysis.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nThe omics work will be implemented in three general stages:\nStage 1: Study design optimization. Biological samples collected in the panel studies (daily urine samples, two blood samples) will be used to assess detectability of omics markers and the likely sources of variability within and between individuals, using small numbers of subjects. These results will inform the design and interpretation of stages 2 and 3.\nStage 2: Omics–exposure associations in the biological samples newly collected in the subcohort (n = 1,200). Primary analyses will evaluate three a priori defined exposures (ETS, total POP concentration, and air pollution) and on the specific multiple exposure clusters generated in research area 3. The three exposures have been selected because we have comparatively good long-term exposure estimates, and already there are some data from human omics studies ( Bollati and Baccarelli 2010 ; Hou et al. 2011 , 2012 ; Rusiecki et al. 2008 ). Power calculations for these analyses are described in the Supplemental Material, Detailed description of omics techniques to be used in HELIX, pp. 4–6, and Table S1. Secondary analyses will examine other exposures. Panel study data will evaluate short-term exposure–omics associations for a range of exposures for which detailed data are collected in the panels: air pollution, noise, UV, and nonpersistent chemicals.\nStage 3. Omics–health associations. Biologically meaningful omics “hits” will be then linked to our main child health end points, similar to the “meet-in-the-middle” approach to biomarker discovery ( Chadeau-Hyam et al. 2011 ). The child health outcomes will be largely continuous outcome scores (BMI z-score, cognitive score, lung function). If relevant, reverse causality potential may be evaluated in blood and urine samples available in some of the cohorts at earlier time points ( Figure 4 ).\nTo analyze, integrate, and interpret the large numbers of data generated by individual omics techniques, HELIX will apply a pathway analysis approach. The biomarkers obtained from the association analysis, in combination with available libraries of biological pathways [Gene Ontology ( http://www.geneontology.org/ ); Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ ); Reactome ( http://www.reactome.org/ ); Comparative Toxicogenomics Database ( http://ctdbase.org/ )] will be used to identify biological pathways affected by the exposures. Identification and representation of biological–toxicological pathways will be done using software such as Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ( http://www.ingenuity.com/ ), Cytoscape ( Saito et al. 2012 ), and Impala ( Kamburov et al. 2011 ). Pathway approaches combining data from different omics techniques (e.g., metabolomics and transcriptomics) are also starting to be developed to search for common pathways determining sensitivity to pharmaceutical and toxic agents ( Cavill et al. 2011 ; Jennen et al. 2011 ; Kamburov et al. 2011 ); HELIX aims to use similar approaches.\nAssociating the Exposome with Child Health\nFinally, one of the greatest challenges of the exposome concept lies in the assessment of its association with health outcomes: How can we integrate multidimensional exposome data to draw meaningful conclusions about (child) health impacts? In general, environmental health studies have considered single exposures or single families of exposure (e.g., atmospheric pollutants, drinking-water pollutants). Notable exceptions of studies that have provided risk estimates for multiple exposures include a cross-sectional EWAS of diabetes ( Patel et al. 2010 , 2013 ) and a study by Budtz-Jørgensen et al. (2010) that considered both PCBs and mercury. Statistical analyses that consider many exposure variables simultaneously in a naïve (agnostic) way, such as the EWAS, strongly increase the risk of observing random associations (false positives) because of multiple testing, and of underestimating the global effect of the environment. In developing statistical tools for the analysis of many exposure factors, we should draw important lessons from the achievements but also the limitations ( Shi and Weinberg 2011 ) of the parallel genome-wide association studies (GWAS) field, particularly regarding the probably weak efficiency of purely agnostic approaches, the very large sample sizes required, and the need to use complementary approaches (e.g., pathway analysis) making use of a priori information.\nFurther, the exposome includes evaluation of multiple exposures, omics markers, and outcomes, each with very different temporal scenarios. A challenge in the development of the statistical analysis protocols is to takes these complexities into account. For example, spatial models for the outdoor exposures are constructed for a specific year and can then be extrapolated to relevant time periods (days, weeks, months, or years) backward or forward in time using available monitoring stations data. For persistent pollutants we may assume that biomarkers give estimates over a relatively long time period, whereas for nonpersistent pollutants biomarkers will reflect only very recent exposures; in some cases we may assume a fairly constant exposure pattern depending on the habits underlying the exposure (e.g., cosmetics use, dietary patterns), whereas in other cases exposure variations may be largely seasonal (e.g., sunscreens, pesticides). Neurodevelopment, growth and obesity, and asthma and allergies are each driven by extremely complex multistage developmental processes that take place prenatally and during the first years of postnatal life. Commonly used statistical techniques for high-dimensional data, such as machine learning, dimension reduction, and variable selection techniques, need to be adapted to the longitudinal context by accommodating issues such as time-varying exposure effects, delayed effects, and effects of exposure trajectories over time on outcome trajectories ( Buck Louis and Sundaram 2012 ).\nResearch area 5: linking the exposome to child health. Research area 5 aims to develop a multistep approach that is based on several tools and methods and will produce risk estimates for different types of exposure variables:\nMany single-exposure variables: This is an agnostic EWAS approach with no a priori information, in which all pairs of exposure–outcome associations will be quantified (using classical regression models), appropriately controlling for false discovery rate (FDR), as is done in GWAS and in the only published EWAS ( Patel et al. 2010 , 2013 ); spline and other smoothing models ( Slama and Werwatz 2005 ) will then look for possible thresholds in dose–response relationships.\nCombined exposure variables: This is an SEM approach ( Budtz-Jørgensen et al. 2010 ) in which synthetic exposure variables will be built based on previous knowledge summarized by directed acyclic graphs. Several sets of synthetic exposure variables will be considered, including those based on common exposure pathways (e.g., indoor and outdoor air pollutants), on exposure patterns generated by the project, and on knowledge of biological pathways.\nGroups of subjects sharing a similar exposome: This approach involves Bayesian profile regression, which aims to identify groups of individuals sharing a similar exposome that at the same time show marked differences according to the health outcome variable of study ( Molitor et al. 2010 ; Papathomas et al. 2011 ). This is achieved by fitting model-based clustering to the exposure data, while allowing the outcome of interest to influence cluster membership. This technique was used, for example, to identify as a high-risk set for lung cancer a cluster of subjects characterized by their living close to a main road, high exposure to PM10 (particulate matter with diameter ≤ 10 μm) and NO2, and carrying out manual work ( Papathomas et al. 2011 ). This technique considers the exposome as a whole instead of breaking up risks for individual exposures, and is therefore able to capture effects and complex interactions and combinations of exposures that cannot be detected with the EWAS approach.\nSEMs and Bayesian profile regression models will also be used to account for the effects of exposure measurement error and uncertainty, in addition to more classical measurement error models such as regression calibration. The general idea is that these techniques treat exposures not as a fixed value, but as a distribution that can be informed from the repeated measurements (e.g., of nonpersistent pollutants) and personal measurements (e.g., of air pollutants) in the panel studies. As a preliminary step, a simulation study aimed at comparing the efficiency of various study designs and statistical approaches to characterize the impact of the exposome on health will be conducted. With a sample size of 1,200 (subcohort), the agnostic EWAS analysis with control for FDR will have a power of 80% to detect a 3-point difference in a continuous outcome variable with a standard deviation of 15 (as in common neurodevelopment indexes), considering that 15% of the tested exposures will show an association ( Liu and Hwang 2007 ). Higher power will be achieved for exposures available for more subjects (e.g., air pollution) and more hypothesis-driven analyses.\nHeterogeneity between cohorts in terms of study design can play a role in the results of these analyses, but it will not be possible to separate these effects from true differences between populations. We will address the issue of cohort differences in two ways: a) We will center all exposures using the cohort mean. Analyses conducted with mean-centered variables will remove differences between cohorts and only consider within-cohort differences in exposure. b) We will document heterogeneity between cohorts, applying random effects models where applicable, and conduct sensitivity analyses excluding one cohort at the time.\nResearch area 6: health impact of multiple exposures. Finally, research area 6 will estimate the burden of common childhood diseases that may be attributed to multiple environmental exposures in Europe. It will construct scenarios for the health impact assessment, working from traditional one-exposure–one-outcome assessments (e.g., traffic-related air pollution and asthma; mercury and neurodevelopment) to more complex benefit–harm scenarios. For example, given increasing obesity rates, children are encouraged to walk or cycle to school, which may lead to increased energy expenditure and possible reduction in weight and improvement in mental health. However, at the same time, longer duration of exposure to air pollutants, noise, and UV may lead to adverse health effects and higher risks of accidents ( Rojas-Rueda et al. 2012 ). Do the overall benefits outweigh these risks, and what should policy makers do to improve these conditions of active transportation? This work will integrate exposure, uncertainty, and biomarker data obtained in HELIX, risk estimates obtained in HELIX, exposure–response data from the literature, exposure data from other existing birth and child cohorts ( Vrijheid et al. 2012 ) and Europe-wide surveys, and prevalence data from existing health registries/surveys in Europe. Expert workshops will be organized to obtain information.\nData warehouse. Data from the previous cohort follow-ups, the new follow-up when the children are 6–9 years of age, the panel studies, and the omics and biomarker analyses will be stored in a common, central database (data warehouse) with common, centrally established QA/QC procedures. Mechanisms to transfer and hold data from across cohorts and other partners will include the identification of agreed data sets, specifications for the data warehouse, data validation, cleaning and harmonization procedures, and the establishment of robust data security mechanisms. Data analysis protocols will be established and performed centrally by a statistical analysis task force. Further, the data warehouse will be established in a format that will allow future uses beyond the project as an accessible resource for researchers external to the project. Procedures for external access will be developed and made public by the end of the project; these will include information regarding data collection, data content, and procedures for data requests.\nConclusions\nThere is a strong consensus that new integrative tools and approaches for human exposure and risk characterization are needed to significantly advance environmental risk and health impact assessment and health protection ( Cohen Hubal et al. 2010 ; Lioy and Rappaport 2011 ; National Research Council 2012 ). Specifically, new approaches are needed to measure and integrate a wide range of (known and unknown) chemical and physical exposures from different sources and link these to health. The exposome concept may be a useful paradigm for this. HELIX is one of the first attempts to describe the early-life exposome of European populations and unravel its relation to omics markers and health in childhood. As proof of concept, HELIX will be able to evaluate the many challenges in the implementation of the exposome concept and will form an important first step toward the description of the life-course exposome and its health effects\nReferences\nAchenbach TM, Rescorla LA. 2000.

It has been estimated that ships produce at least 15% of the world’s NOx, ~4% of greenhouse gases, ~5% of black carbon and ~7% of global SO2 output. International shipping traffic presents a major challenge in terms of environment and human health which entails severe economic consequences. During the past decade, the use of non-thermal plasma for the abatement of NOx and SOx has been gaining momentum [1]. Non-thermal plasma selectively transfers input electrical energy to the electrons and to not expend this in heating the entire gas stream, which generates free radicals through collisions and promotes the desired chemical changes in the marine diesel engine exhaust gas. Abatement of NO from the exhaust of a 2 kW diesel engine was experimentally demonstrated in the work reported here. An AC corona based non-thermal plasma (NTP) followed by Ag/Al2O3 catalyst was used to convert NOx (NO+NO2) into harmless N2. A high frequency high voltage source ((~ 4.5 MHz and 30 kV) was used to generate the required NTP. In this set-up, the produced NTP was a streamer plasma [2], where no arc-discharge between the high voltage and ground electrode would be produced due to the fast switching of polarity between plates. Two percent silver (by weight) was impregnated onto the 3 mm Al2O3 beads using a rotary evaporator at 50◦C. Catalyst was heated to 350-400◦c to activate the catalytic effect during the abatement process. In a two-step process, firstly NO would be converted into NO2 in the NTP reactor followed by NO2 conversion into N2 in the catalytic chamber. The flow rate of the exhaust treated was 15 l/min and NOx concentration was 550 ppm. Overall the NOx conversion efficiency was more than 90%. This technique has shown repeatable superior performance than the results reported by McAdams et al [3], whose study was only based on pre-mixed bottles gases, whereas this study was based on real engine exhaust which contained 12% O2 in addition to soot, CO, CO2, HC and other unknown traces of gases.\nURI: \n""","0.026071003","""http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/14851""","[-0.472855,51.532848]"

This element of risk increases in an urban development, which can negatively impact the external stakeholders associated with the project, along with their surrounding environments.Therefore, this paper aims to identify and document the numerous issues encountered by project managers from external stakeholders and how they affect construction projects, particularly in a confined site environment. In addressing this aim, the core objective is to identify what issues are involved in managing the stakeholders in these inherently risky environments. A qualitative methodology encompassing an informative literature review is undertaken, followed by five case studies with professionals in industry. The data gathered is assessed qualitatively using mind mapping software, and cognitively summarised. Twenty-six issues are identified, and collectively five main themes occur; environmental, traffic, legal, health and safety and communication issues. A wide range of issues can develop depending on the complexity of each project, but this research will illustrate and reinforce to project managers that early identification of issues, combined with effective response strategies, can be used to manage the issues considering external stakeholders on urban construction projects.\nDocuments\n""","0.45662445","""http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/urban-development-and-construction-project-management-issues-considering-external-stakeholders(743c0168-7674-4c6f-8be6-891c129bdb11).html""","[-5.934759,54.583863]"

Using questionnaires and semi‐structured interviews with key stakeholders, we investigate the ways in which diverse conceptions of ‘the environment’ shaped public reactions to these proposals, and evaluate the fit between these and the respondents’ stated environmental perceptions. 98% of local residents surveyed describe themselves as ‘concerned about the environment’. However, large majorities conceive of the environment as a local rather than a global phenomenon, and regard it primarily in terms of personal benefits (such as landscape aesthetics or traffic considerations). By exploring the environmental perceptions in the light of the planning proposals, the study supports the contention that the ‘local environment’ is a socially constructed phenomenon which can be fashioned and re‐fashioned according to local perceptions of threats and opportunities.\nPublication data is maintained in RPS.

The braking maneuver along with other driving maneuvers such as normal driving will be clustered and the results from different algorithms which are K-means and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) will be compared. Additionally, the importance evaluation of features from raw dataset respect to driving maneuvers clustering will be proposed.

In this paper, three types of interior PMSMs with different PM arrangements are modeled by the finite element method (FEM). For a given amount of permanent magnet materials, the V shape interior PMSM is found better than the U-shape and the conventional rotor topologies for EV traction drives. Then the V shape interior PMSM is further analyzed with the effects of stator slot opening and the permanent magnet pole chamfering on cogging torque and output torque performance. A vector-controlled flux-weakening method is developed and simulated in matlab to expand the motor speed range for EV drive system. The results show good dynamic and steady-state performance with a capability of expanding speed up to 4 times of the rated. A prototype of the V shape interior PMSM is also manufactured and tested to validate the numerical models built by the finite element method.\nDocuments\nDesign and flux-weakening control\nRights statement: © 2016 IEEE.

Existing work on such mechanisms has typically assumed that participants are fully rational and can report their preferences accurately via some interface to the mechanism or to a software agent participating on their behalf. However, this may not be reasonable in settings with non-expert human end-users.Thus, our overarching aim in this paper is to determine experimentally if a fully expressive market interface that enables accurate preference reports is suitable for the EV charging domain, or, alternatively, if a simpler, restricted interface that reduces the space of possible options is preferable. In doing this, we measure the performance of an interface both in terms of how it helps participants maximise their utility and how it affects deliberation time. Our secondary objective is to contrast two different types of restricted interfaces that vary in how they restrict the space of preferences that can be reported. To enable this analysis, we develop a novel game that replicates key features of an abstract EV charging scenario. In two experiments with over 300 users, we show that restricting the users' preferences significantly reduces the time they spend deliberating (by up to half in some cases). An extensive usability survey confirms that this restriction is furthermore associated with a lower perceived cognitive burden on the users. More surprisingly, at the same time, using restricted interfaces leads to an increase in the users' performance compared to the fully expressive interface (by up to 70%). We also show that some restricted interfaces have the desirable effect of reducing the energy consumption of their users by up to 20% while achieving the same utility as other interfaces. Finally, we find that a reinforcement learning agent displays similar performance trends to human users, enabling a novel methodology for evaluating market interfaces.\n""","0.22742236","""http://jair.org/papers/paper5387.html""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

This action has largely been driven by concerns relating to the contribution of blood transfusion to the HIV epidemic in the region, leading to the overwhelming objective of “safe blood.” Whilst there have been definite benefits to transfusion services, we believe this aid has resulted in unintended but serious negative outcomes, which we describe here and argue should prompt a re-thinking of how to provide support to blood transfusion services in sub-Saharan Africa.\nSupport has targeted either single countries such as Malawi, Rwanda, Burkina Faso, and Uganda [1] , [2] or multiple countries [3] . Funds, available only for limited periods, have been used to support a combination of infrastructure design and construction; purchase of equipment; screening for transfusion-transmitted infections and quality assurance; and the recruitment of blood donors. As a direct consequence of this funding, some of the underlying principles of transfusion services practised in the high-income donor countries have been applied in sub-Saharan Africa recipient countries ( Box 1 ). These principles may be based on sound practice in wealthy countries but do not necessarily apply to sub-Saharan Africa at this time. We argue that considering the needs of sub-Saharan Africa, external aid was to some extent misdirected in the areas of donor recruitment, overall organisation, and availability of products.\nBox 1. The Principles Underlying External Financial Support for Blood Transfusion Services in Sub-Saharan Africa\ncentralisation of operations in relatively large blood centres, which are stand alone institutions independent physically and functionally from hospitals able to collect, process, and distribute >10,000 blood donations a year. Automation becomes feasible and quality assurance programmes are more practicable.\nThe exclusive recruitment of VNRD, which has been practiced for over 30 years in developed countries; this is based on the assumption that other types of donor are less safe owing to higher prevalence of HIV-1 infections.\nThe preparation of blood components with the assumption that this is a more effective use of whole blood donations.\nCurrent Transfusion Practice in Sub-Saharan Africa\nIt is important to recognise the particular circumstances and specific needs of recipient countries, which differ considerably for historical and economic reasons. Whereas blood product use in wealthy countries is largely pre-planned and predictable, the vast majority of blood product use in sub-Saharan Africa is for emergencies, therefore truly saving lives when delivered quickly [4] . Depending on the country, 50% to 80% of transfusions are related to just a few clinical circumstances: severe haemorrhage in women related to pregnancy and childbirth; trauma usually as a consequence of road traffic crashes; and severe anaemia in young children, often due to malaria. Timely access to blood transfusion has a clear role to play in achieving two of the Millennium Development Goals—reducing death rates by two-thirds in children under-five and by three-quarters in mothers. For severe malarial anaemia the product of choice, which has been shown to save lives and is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), is whole blood [5] – [8] .\nBefore national blood transfusion services were established, blood provision in sub-Saharan Africa was totally decentralised, with blood banks operating in individual hospitals and often collecting 1,000 to 10,000 units a year. These blood banks were, and still are, an integral part of the hospitals they serve and are located close to patients, clinicians, and hospital managers [9] . Blood donors are often family or replacement donors, who are recruited from the relatives or friends of patients [10] . Replacement donors are described as such because for each unit of blood that is transfused, the onus is on the wider family circle to replace it in order to maintain supply [10] , [11] . Paid donors may be called upon when family or friends are unable to meet this responsibility. Collecting blood from paid donors is banned in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa because they are notoriously unsafe but, in some settings without access to computerised donor registries, distinguishing them from family donors is often challenging [12] .\nTransfusion services in sub-Saharan Africa have been organised in this way because of culture, climate, communications, and, most importantly, because resources are limited. This fragmentation makes coordination of blood services and implementation of good laboratory practices and their quality assurance difficult, and imposes an additional burden on families in already stressful circumstances. Patients often present to hospital late in the course of their disease process [6] – [8] . Because life is at risk, the family traditionally congregates to support the patient and supplies blood when it is asked for.\nIf transfusion costs are not met by governments or health insurance funding, the cost of a unit of blood can often be prohibitive for families [13] . If transfusion costs are covered by governments or insurance, the cost can substantially affect the limited budgets of hospitals (for blood banks) or government (for blood centres) [10] . To produce a unit of whole blood from a family donor costs two to four times less than a unit from a voluntary non-remunerated, blood donor (VNRD) [10] . Maintaining centralised blood centres and managing the quality assurance and donor recruitment processes is expensive, so it is not surprising that, when external support is discontinued, the cost of blood products far exceeds the locally available budget.\nThe three principles outlined in Box 1 , when imposed without careful consideration of local conditions, can undermine efforts to improve the supply of safe blood. Although the conditions of external financial assistance are discussed at the government level, practitioners on the ground are rarely consulted [14] – [17] .\nCentralisation\nEvidence indicates that for both severe haemorrhage and malaria-related severe anaemia, mortality increases significantly if transfusion is delayed more than 1 hour [4] , [18] . Rapid availability of blood is therefore critical. However, low and unpredictable blood demand in small hospital blood banks means that they cannot justify keeping a fully tested bloodstock from family-replacement donors. It is also difficult for small blood banks to establish and maintain high-quality procedures when fewer than ten units/day are collected and there is high staff turnover [14] . Conversely, reliance on a distant centralised source for blood in settings where communications are unreliable, fuel shortages are common, and roads may be impassable, will inevitably result in delays and stock-outs.\nSole Reliance on Volunteer Non-remunerated Donors\nWhen applied dogmatically, the VNRD-only policy can prolong or worsen the chronic blood shortages experienced in blood systems that previously relied on family-replacement donors [7] . Neither VNRD nor family-replacement donors alone have been able to provide an adequate blood supply [19] , [20] , and diversity in donor sources is desirable [21] . Security of supply is difficult to achieve exclusively with VNRD who, in most countries, are predominantly secondary school students unavailable during school recesses and exam periods. Thus, the blood supply for as much as 3 months of the year is restricted. In contrast, family-replacement donors are available year round. The majority of blood donors in sub-Saharan Africa are first-time donors. Studies of HIV and hepatitis B virus prevalence in first-time donors have shown a similar risk profile in VNRD and family-replacement donors [11] , [22] – [26] . Regular donors, irrespective of type, are substantially safer than first-time donors [11] . The higher costs of blood donated by VNRD compared with family-replacement donors [9] , [11] result from the infrastructure necessary to recruit and retain them [20] .\nBlood Component Preparation\nWe recognise that the component model in the developed world has some justification from the perspectives of both quality and safety. However, in sub-Saharan Africa a policy of systematic component preparation from all donations can result in serious negative consequences ( Box 2 ). Figure 1 illustrates the situation of individual blood centres in five countries that receive no external support for their blood services (left) and four countries that are supported by wealthy countries (right). The nationally funded blood services prepare and transfuse almost exclusively whole blood whereas the externally supported group, with the exception of one centre in Côte d'Ivoire, prepares almost exclusively red cell concentrates [27] . Only one study has presented the clinical side effects of transfusion in sub-Saharan Africa but did not compare whole blood with blood components [28] .\nDownload:\n""","0.16298273","""http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001309""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

The paper documents both the design procedure and performance investigation of this novel machine.\nDesign/methodology/approach\n–\nThe topology and preliminary sizing equations of the ORPMFSM are introduced. The rotor poles are optimized, whilst the machine losses are particularly investigated, using 2‐D finite element analysis (FEA).\nFindings\n–\nAn ORPMFSM, with 12 stator poles and 22 rotor poles, is most suitable for the proposed EV application. The analytical sizing equations are quite efficient with a sufficient accuracy for the preliminary design. The optimal rotor pole width from the FEA results is nearly 1.3 times the original value which was proposed in early literatures. The efficiency of the proposed machine under rated load is slightly low, as a result of significant eddy current losses in the permanent magnets. The losses can be effectively suppressed with the technique of magnet segmenting. The predicted outstanding performance implies that by adopting magnet segmentation the proposed machine is a leading contender for EV direct drives.\nOriginality/value\n–\nThe outer‐rotor structure of PMFSM was not addressed in early literatures. This paper provides designers with the technical background and an alternative candidate for the EV propulsion.\nKeywords:\n""","7.5344415","""http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/03321641111091421""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease that may appear at any age (most often in childhood), and can persist, possibly remit, or show variable activity over time ( Strachan et al. 1996 ; Wenzel 2012 ). The complexity of this chronic disease is particularly challenging, and more research is needed on the environmental determinants of the disease (and not only on the acute triggers of attacks), because the increase in asthma incidence over the last decades ( Eder et al. 2006 ) strongly suggests a role of environmental factors. The role of air pollutants in triggering asthma exacerbations in young and adult asthma patients is established ( Peel et al. 2005 ; Sunyer et al. 1997 ). Several studies support the role of air pollution in the development of asthma in childhood ( Anderson et al. 2013 ; McConnell et al. 2010 ), but not all ( Mölter et al. 2015 ). The role of air pollution in adult-onset asthma (i.e., asthma incidence) has been investigated in only a few studies ( Anderson et al. 2013 ; Jacquemin et al. 2012 ; Young et al. 2014 ) and should not be extrapolated from studies in children because childhood-onset and adult-onset asthma are two distinct asthma phenotypes that have, at least partly, different clinical, biological, and genetic characteristics ( Wenzel 2012 ). Among studies in adults, only four have used individually assigned air pollution estimates at home addresses. A small Swedish case–control study (203 cases and 203 controls) suggested an association of traffic-related nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with asthma incidence, but the study lacked statistical power ( Modig et al. 2006 ). Both the Respiratory Health in Northern Europe (RHINE) study (3,824 participants) ( Modig et al. 2009 ) and the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) (4,185 participants) ( Jacquemin et al. 2009b ) reported a positive association between NO2 and asthma incidence. The Swiss Study on Air Pollution and Health in Adults (SAPALDIA) found similar results, but only in never-smokers and using source-specific models of local traffic-related particulate matter (PM) as a marker of exposure ( Künzli et al. 2009 ). A recent U.S. study suggested an association of PM2.5 (≤ 2.5 μm) with incident asthma in women ( Young et al. 2014 ). Two recent reviews concluded that the existing evidence suggests a possible role of air pollution in adult-onset asthma but that the evidence is not conclusive because the studies lacked of power, suggesting the need for larger cohorts ( Anderson et al. 2013 ; Jacquemin et al. 2012 ).\nThe European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) developed, for the first time at large scale, fully standardized air pollution measurement, modeling, and assignment methods to individually characterize home outdoor exposure ( Beelen et al. 2013 ; Eeftens et al. 2012 ). We took advantage of a follow-up of > 10 years among 23,704 adults in six prospective cohorts from eight countries to assess the association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and asthma incidence in adulthood.\nMethods\nStudy population and assessment of asthma incidence. Six prospective cohorts from 24 areas in eight countries contributed to the analysis of asthma incidence in adulthood over a 10-year period. Three of these cohorts [ECRHS ( ECRHS II Steering Committee 2002 ), the French Epidemiological study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma (EGEA) ( Siroux et al. 2009 ), and SAPALDIA ( Ackermann-Liebrich et al. 2005 )] were respiratory epidemiological cohorts, with detailed information regarding respiratory symptoms, bronchial challenge tests, and sensitization. The three others were general health cohorts. The study on the influence of Air pollution on Lung function, Inflammation and Aging (SALIA; Schikowski et al. 2010 ) and SAPALDIA were originally designed to investigate effects of air pollution. ECRHS, SAPALDIA, and the Medical Research Council’s National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) ( Kuh et al. 2011 ) corresponded to a representative sample of subjects of predefined areas. The Etude Epidémiologique auprès de femmes de la Mutuelle Générale de l’Education Nationale (E3N) ( Clavel-Chapelon et al. 1997 ) and SALIA were conducted in elderly women. EGEA included by design a high proportion of relatives of asthma patients recruited in chest clinics. ECRHS, EGEA, and SAPALDIA were initiated in the 1990s and followed-up 9–12 years later. NSHD is a birth cohort of participants born in 1946 and with > 20 regular follow-ups since then; for this analysis, baseline was considered in 1989 and follow-up in 1999. E3N women were recruited in 1990 and followed-up every 2 years; the last follow-up included for this analysis is the one from 2008. SALIA women were recruited in 1985; a questionnaire follow-up was conducted in 2006 and a second from 2007 to 2010. For detailed information on each study, see Supplemental Material, Table S1 and Figure S1.\nFor each cohort, the absence of asthma at baseline and the incidence of asthma during follow-up were defined as shown in Supplemental Material, Table S2, according to the availability of each cohort’s variables. Two principles were followed regarding the assessment of asthma: harmonization across cohorts and optimal use of available information. Depending on the cohort, asthma was defined by two standardized questionnaires: the British Medical Research Council questionnaire ( Samet 1978 ), which originated in the 1960s, and the ECRHS questionnaire ( Burney et al. 1994 ), designed in the 1990s. For all studies, asthma incidence was defined only in subjects without asthma at baseline. To further improve the specificity of our asthma incidence definition ( Pekkanen et al. 2005 ; Sunyer et al. 2007 ), we also excluded from the population at risk of new-onset asthma any participant who reported at baseline three of five asthma-like symptoms in the preceding 12 months (wheeze and breathlessness; chest tightness; attack of shortness of breath at rest; attack of shortness of breath after exercise; awakening by attack of shortness of breath); this information was available in three of the six cohorts (ECRHS, EGEA, SAPALDIA) ( Boudier et al. 2013 ). (For flow charts and criteria used to classify asthma for each cohort, see Supplemental Material, Table S2 and Figure S1.) In ECRHS, SAPALDIA, and EGEA, objective asthma-related traits were available. Methacholine bronchial provocation tests were performed and bronchial responsiveness defined when the provocative dose to decrease by 20% the forced expiratory flow volume in 1 sec was ≤ 1 mg cumulative dose of methacholine. Allergic sensitization was assessed as at least one skin prick test or at least one specific immunoglobulin E > 0.35 U/mL (see Table 1 for details). In all studies, hay fever was recorded by questionnaire at baseline and follow-up. Eczema was assessed in some studies. Moving status was defined based on the available data, considering addresses (geocodes) when baseline address was available and reported move assessed through questionnaire otherwise. Ethical approval was obtained for each cohort/center from the appropriate institutional or regional ethics committee, and written consent was obtained from each participant.\nTable 1 – Characteristics of participants with NO2 exposure estimates in the ESCAPE analyses, by study (n) and outcome.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nThe covariates were chosen based on evidence from previous studies ( Jacquemin et al. 2009b ; Künzli et al. 2009 ; Modig et al. 2009 ) but also taking into account the assessment and quality of available data within the ESCAPE cohorts. Smoking (current, former, never), maximum educational level (low, medium, high), and overweight [body mass index (BMI) < 25, ≥ 25 kg/m2, except in ECRHS where an additional missing category was created because > 20% of data were missing for this variable] were considered in the analysis.\nCity/area refers to the city in ECRHS, EGEA, E3N, and SAPALDIA and the country in NSHD (England, Wales, and Scotland). All SALIA participants came from one area.\nExposure data. Measurements of NO2/NOx (nitrogen oxides) were conducted in three seasons in 2010 or 2011 using passive samplers in the 24 areas. Areas refers to cities (with or without their metropolitan areas) in most of the cases, except in the United Kingdom where it is the whole country and in the Ruhr region in Germany where it is an urban area including several cities. PM monitoring campaigns were conducted in 12 areas. Exposure estimates at the participants’ addresses at follow-up [NO2, NOx, PM10 (≤ 10 μm), PM2.5, PM2.5absorbance, PMcoarse] derived from land use regression (LUR) models were used as primary exposure covariates ( Beelen et al. 2014 ; Eeftens et al. 2012 ; see also http://www.escapeproject.eu ). Back-extrapolated exposure estimates for NO2 and PM10 were used for sensitivity analyses because ESCAPE air pollution measurement campaigns took place after the health surveys for most cohorts. The back-extrapolated concentration was estimated by multiplying the modeled ESCAPE annual mean concentration by the ratio between average annual concentrations as derived from the routine monitoring site(s) for the period in the past and for the ESCAPE measurement period time ( Beelen et al. 2014 ). Exposures were back-extrapolated to the follow-up period using routinely available air pollution monitoring data, but could not be extrapolated to baseline for all the areas because of a lack of earlier monitoring data for some cities, particularly for PM10. Furthermore, baseline addresses were not available in all the cohorts. Traffic exposure indicators, traffic intensity (on the nearest road), and traffic load (in a 100-m buffer) were derived from geographic databases.\nData analysis. The following cohort-specific random-effects logistic regressions were performed for all air pollution metrics: unadjusted (model 1), adjusted for age and sex (model 2), and additionally adjusted for smoking, overweight, and education level at baseline (model 3, the main model). Cox regression analysis was not used due to imprecision of the date of onset. The heterogeneity of the effect estimates between the cohorts was tested using the chi-square test. Meta-analytic estimates were estimated using fixed-effects models in the absence of heterogeneity between cohorts (p-value of heterogeneity > 0.1), and using random-effects models when heterogeneity between cohorts was present. The I2 statistic was calculated for quantifying heterogeneity. For meta-analyses of subgroups (age, sex, and smoking status), meta-analytic stratum-specific estimates were derived and were compared between strata. Cohort-specific estimates in subgroup analyses were conducted using model 3, but without taking into account random effects per city/area because random-effects models encountered convergence problems.\nBecause NO2 is not measured near busy roads, models of associations with traffic variables were adjusted for background NO2. Random effects were used for the main relevant cluster for each cohort (city/area for E3N, ECRHS, NSHD, and SAPALDIA, or family for EGEA).\nSensitivity analyses were conducted a) to address the robustness of the association to a change in the window of exposure (by using back-extrapolated NO2 and PM10); b) to address the possible impact of the exposure models’ performance [by restricting analyses to areas where exposure models had the highest predictive value (cross-validation R2 > 0.6)]; c) to better compare the NO2 with the PM results (by restricting NO2 analyses to participants who also had PM measurements); d) to unmask a possible effect of one pollutant over the other using a two-pollutant model (NO2 and PM10); e) excluding individuals with a self-reported age-at-onset ≥ 2 years prior baseline according to record at follow-up, to better capture adult-onset asthma and not reappearance of childhood onset of asthma ( Jacquemin et al. 2009b ); this analysis is referred to as incidence with coherent age of onset in tables; f) excluding individuals with exposures at both upper and lower 5% extremes of pollutant values; and g) adjusting for “study city/area” as a fixed effect instead of random effect, as used before ( Jacquemin et al. 2009b ) but debated ( Neuhaus and Kalbfleisch 1998 ). Stratified analyses were conducted by age (< 50 or ≥ 50 years), sex, and smoking (ever- or never-smokers) and analyses restricted to nonmovers were conducted. We investigated the robustness of the meta-analyses estimates by excluding consecutively each cohort. We performed further analyses within the ECRHS cohort to allow direct comparison with a previous ECRHS publication ( Jacquemin et al. 2009b ) that estimated NO2 using the APMoSPHERE (Air Pollution Modelling for Support to Policy on Health and Environmental Risk in Europe) model, a 1 × 1 km surface model developed using GIS-based techniques ( Vienneau et al. 2009 ).\nAll the results are shown for an increase of 10 μg/m3 of NO2 and PM10, 5 μg/m3 of PM2.5 and PMcoarse, 10–5/m1 of PM2.5absorbance and 20 μg/m3 of NOx. For traffic measures, the results are shown for an increase of 5,000 vehicles/day for traffic intensity on the nearest road and four millions vehicles × m/day for traffic load in major roads within a 100-m buffer. Analyses used Stata version 12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).\nResults\nPopulation. The six cohorts contributed to 1,257 incident cases of asthma for the total population of 23,704 participants ( Table 1 ). Cohorts differed by several characteristics, reflecting recruitment differences. Asthma incidence rates varied from 2.9/1,000/year in SAPALDIA to 8.3/1,000/year in EGEA. In the three cohorts (ECRHS, EGEA, SAPALDIA) with available data, participants who developed asthma after baseline (i.e., incident asthma cases) were more likely than other participants to be classified as having bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) at baseline (28% vs. 9% with a positive methacholine test), and were even more likely to have BHR at follow-up (40% compared with 9%). Compared with subjects who did not develop asthma, those with incident asthma exhibited more allergic sensitization, before (baseline) and after (follow-up) the onset of asthma. Hay fever was twice as common among participants with incident asthma compared with those without asthma (except for NSHD and EGEA at baseline).\nAir pollution and traffic metrics. Mean and median air pollution exposures were lower for the NSHD cohort compared with the other five cohorts, though distributions overlapped among the cohorts ( Figure 1 ; see also Supplemental Material, Table S3). The highest mean NO2 concentration was found in E3N (31 ± 13 μg/m3) and the lowest in NSHD (22 ± 7 μg/m3). For PM10, the highest mean concentration was found in SALIA (27 ± 2 μg/m3) and the lowest in NSHD (16 ± 2 μg/m3). Cohort-specific interquartile ranges (IQRs) indicated substantial variability in the exposure contrasts within cohorts, ranging from 8 to 20 μg/m3 and 2 to 8 μg/m3 for NO2 and PM10, respectively (see Supplemental Material, Table S3). The highest correlation coefficients were always seen between NO2 and NOx (r > 0.90) (see Supplemental Material, Table S4). Correlation coefficients between NO2 and PM10 varied from 0.53 in E3N to 0.83 in SAPALDIA. Correlation coefficients between the different air pollutant concentrations and the traffic indicators showed wide between-cohort heterogeneity (from 0.06 for NO2 and traffic intensity in NSHD to 0.81 for PM2.5absorbance and traffic load within a 100-m buffer in EGEA) (Table S4). All the LUR models had a leave-one-out cross validation R2 > 50%, and most of them > 80% ( Beelen et al. 2013 ; Eeftens et al. 2012 ) (see Supplemental Material, Table S5).\nFigure 1 – NO2 and PM10 concentrations (μg/m3) by study. Boxes extend from the 25th to the 75th percentile, bars inside the boxes represent the median, and whiskers indicate the minimum and maximum values.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nAssociations between air pollutants and traffic metrics and asthma incidence. The unadjusted, simple (adjusted by sex and age), and fully adjusted models provided similar results in individual cohorts ( Table 2 ). The fully adjusted meta-analytic estimate for NO2 was positive [odds ratio (OR) = 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.99, 1.21; p = 0.10]. The association did not change when using the back-extrapolated NO2 ESCAPE estimates (OR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.20) ( Table 2 and Figure 2 ). When adjusting by city/area as a fixed effect (instead of random effect), the OR for NO2 increased to 1.14 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.29) ( Table 3 ), changes being driven mainly by an increased association estimate in ECRHS (OR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.80 instead of OR = 1.07; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.23).\nTable 2 – Meta-analyses of associations between air pollutants and traffic indicators and the risk for asthma incidence.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nNO2 estimates were positive in all sensitivity and stratified analyses ( Table 3 ). Using the stricter definition of asthma incidence with coherent age of onset did not modify the associations but confidence intervals were wider as power was decreased ( Table 3 ). The analyses that were restricted to nonmovers or that excluded the 5% extreme value of the pollutants tended to decrease the associations (OR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.10 and OR = 1.03; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.10; respectively) ( Table 3 ). Although cohort-specific association estimates suggested the possibility of between-cohort differences, with stronger estimates in the French EGEA cohort compared with the others ( Figure 2 ), heterogeneity among the cohorts was not statistically significant ( Table 2 ). After consecutive exclusion of each cohort in the meta-analyses, the point estimate of the OR always remained positive, varying from 1.03 to 1.15, reaching significance for NO2 after the exclusion of E3N (OR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.27 with a decreased heterogeneity between cohorts’ estimates) ( Table 3 ) or SAPALDIA (OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.24). A trend for stronger association between NO2 and asthma incidence was observed in ever-smokers compared with never-smokers (OR = 1.13; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.29 and OR = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.16, respectively) (p-interaction = 0.35) ( Table 3 ). Neither age nor sex modified the associations between NO2 and asthma incidence (p-interaction = 0.88 and 0.66, respectively) ( Table 3 ). Restricting the analyses either to centers with both NO2 and PM10 measurements or to areas with a high goodness of fit of the LUR models did not modify the associations between NO2 and asthma incidence.\nFor PM10, meta-estimates were similar and not significant in models with or without back-extrapolation (OR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.87, 1.24 and OR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.23, respectively) ( Table 2 ). Except for PMcoarse, estimates were all positive but not significant, though borderline significant for NOx (OR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.08) ( Table 2 ).\nPM10 estimates were positive and tended to increase in any sensitivity analysis, except when excluding EGEA, but never reached significance ( Table 3 ). The analyses that were restricted to nonmovers or excluded the 5% extreme value of the pollutants tended to increase the associations (OR = 1.12; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.37 and OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 0.89, 1.37, respectively). In the stratified analyses, slightly stronger associations between PM10 and asthma incidence were observed in ever-smokers compared with never-smokers (OR = 1.17; 95% CI: 0.79, 1.74 and OR = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.16, respectively) and in women compared with men (OR = 1.07; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.26 and OR = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.59, respectively), whereas associations were similar for age < 50 and ≥ 50 years.\nIn the bi-pollutant model, the NO2 estimate increased from 1.10 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.21) to 1.17 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.38), whereas the PM10 estimate decreased from 1.04 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.23) to 0.98 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.21) ( Table 3 ).\nThe comparison of ECRHS results using ESCAPE NO2 estimates or the previously published APMoSPHERE NO2 estimates ( Jacquemin et al. 2009b ) showed that the effect estimates were sensitive to both the analytic approach and the exposure models. Higher effect estimates were observed in the model with study/city used as fixed effect and/or when using the APMoSPHERE exposure model (see Supplemental Material, Table S6). For instance, the estimate based on the ESCAPE model and random effect on city was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.20) and increased up to 1.94 (95% CI: 1.27, 2.96) in the model using the APMoSPHERE air pollution exposure and adjusted on city.\nDiscussion\nIn this longitudinal investigation, asthma incidence was positively associated with all exposure metrics, except with the coarse fraction of PM. The association was borderline statistically significant for a 10-μg/m3 increase in NO2 (OR = 1.10; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.21) and significant with back-extrapolated NO2 (OR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.20). Overall, these findings provide suggestive but not firm evidence for a role of ambient air pollution on asthma incidence in adults.\nThe main strengths of this study are a large population from a wide geographical area, including > 23,000 participants from eight countries and > 20 different cities across Europe using standardized air pollution estimates at the residential address for a variety of air pollutant metrics. This was achieved through a standardized procedure regarding air pollutants measurements, development of land use regression models, and validation ( Beelen et al. 2013 ; Eeftens et al. 2012 ). The lack of highly significant associations in our findings is in line with three interpretations: namely, that there is no such association, that pollutants affect only subgroups of adults, or that we were unable to reliably capture such association as a result of epidemiological bias or lack of power. Overall the validity of those LUR models, assessed with the R2 (see Supplemental Material, Table S5), were good, although this varied across study sites. We showed that restricting the NO2 analyses to the centers with higher R2 did not modify the results. A simulation study showed that LUR modeling with a small number of measurement sites may bias the health-effect estimates in the form of attenuation toward the null ( Basagaña et al. 2013 ). The lack of association with PM may result partly from the small number of measurement sites for these pollutants. A further limitation was the long lag between the health assessments of most of our cohorts and the standardized ESCAPE measurement campaigns, reaching up to 20 years in some of the cohorts. The resulting exposure misclassification likely contributed to imprecise risk estimates and a bias toward the null ( Basagaña et al. 2013 ). To investigate this, back-extrapolated exposure estimates to the follow-up periods for NO2 were analyzed. The odds ratio using back-extrapolated values then reached formal statistical significance, but the effect size, which relied mainly on within-city contrasts, was virtually identical to that in the initial analysis. The validity of back-extrapolation of LUR models is supported by a study showing a good correlation between the 1991 back-extrapolated NO2 concentrations estimated from the 2009 LUR model and the NO2 concentrations measured by monitoring sites in 1991 ( Gulliver et al. 2013 ). However, back-extrapolated exposure estimates will not account for potential changes over time in spatial contrasts within cities, so their validity may vary by location and time. This is an inherent limitation of the ESCAPE project. Nevertheless, associations with other outcomes investigated in ESCAPE, including mortality ( Beelen et al. 2014 ) and lung cancer incidence ( Raaschou-Nielsen et al. 2013 ), have been similar for exposures based on ESCAPE measurement period estimates and exposures based on back-extrapolated estimates.\nCaution is necessary when interpreting our findings. Although positive, associations with PM and traffic proximity were nonsignificant, which may indicate that these pollutants do not affect adult-onset asthma or that the analyses lacked statistical power to reliably estimate small effects among rather heterogeneous cohorts. The fact that the positive associations with NO2 were the closest to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that NO2 is the causal pollutant. It could reflect that our exposure model more accurately estimates the true exposure for this pollutant [which is supported by a trend for a higher R2 cross-validation of the LUR model for NO2 compared with PM10 ( Beelen et al. 2013 ; Eeftens et al. 2012 )]. Further, given the correlation between pollutant concentrations, we cannot estimate associations with individual pollutants that account for potential confounding by other pollutants. Moreover, no matter how good the exposure models are, there will always be limitations and potential bias in estimating association using exposure estimates only at home addresses that do not account for the individual spatiotemporal activity.\nThe design induces some limitation regarding the generalizability of our result to other European cities. For all cohorts, the first inclusion criterion was the availability of ESCAPE models, which varied from 20% for E3N (a national study) to 100% for SALIA and NSHD. At the whole cohort level, follow-up rates were less variable, varying between 60% and 80%, which represents a reasonable follow-up rate for such long-term studies ( Ackermann-Liebrich et al. 2005 ; Antó et al. 2010 ; Kuh et al. 2011 ; Sanchez et al. 2013 ; Schikowski et al. 2010 ; Siroux et al. 2009 ). Though our study is the largest ever conducted in Europe, with the greatest number of countries and areas, and our estimates did not indicate strong heterogeneity in associations across cohorts, some caution is needed in extrapolating our results, particularly in relation to the heterogeneity between areas, and more importantly to the small sample size in each area.\nDefining asthma incidence is more challenging than defining outcomes such as mortality ( Beelen et al. 2014 ) or lung cancer ( Raaschou-Nielsen et al. 2013 ). Furthermore, because adults may not remember early-life wheezing, assessment of adult-onset asthma is difficult ( Strachan et al. 1996 ). A thorough comparison of questionnaires and protocols was undertaken to harmonize asthma definition across the various cohorts without losing valuable information. Although only ECRHS and SAPALDIA were purposefully designed to assess asthma incidence, we were as rigorous as possible in identifying only incident cases, by excluding participants who reported asthma or, when available, asthma-like symptoms at baseline from our study population. Bias in asthma diagnosis may have been introduced through both different cultural perceptions of asthma in the countries in which the cohorts were located, and the different questionnaires and diagnostic protocols used. In the largest cohort included, E3N, the validity of the simple asthma question used has been investigated in a subsample study, which showed good concordance with questions similar to those used in respiratory surveys and with dispensed asthma drug treatment ( Sanchez et al. 2013 ). Because of a limited number of cohorts with bronchial challenge tests, we were unable to perform a sensitivity analysis defining asthma as new bronchial hyperresponsiveness plus symptoms, as used in a previous study of occupational risk factors for asthma ( Kogevinas et al. 2007 ). However, for the three cohorts with information on bronchial hyperresponsiveness, the validity of our incident asthma classification was supported by the increase in bronchial hyperresponsiveness between baseline and follow-up among participants who developed asthma after the baseline examination.\nResults should be interpreted in the context of current knowledge and research regarding asthma phenotypes. It is established that childhood-onset asthma, compared with adult-onset asthma, occurs more in males, is more often associated with allergic sensitization, and also depends on specific genetic determinants ( Bouzigon et al. 2008 ; Wenzel 2012 ). With the increase of childhood asthma, the potential recurrence of asthma in adulthood after remission becomes an increasing concern. Recent research on asthma temporal patterns and data-driven phenotyping conducted in four of the six cohorts included in the present analysis show the complexity of asthma variability over periods of around 10 years in adulthood ( Boudier et al. 2013 ; Sanchez et al. 2013 ). Asthma in childhood only, adulthood only, old age only, mild (often forgotten) childhood asthma reappearing in adulthood, or persistent asthma throughout the life span are various phenotypes that may depend on both genetic and environmental determinants of various critical windows of expression/exposure. The variability of asthma can be characterized according to different windows of time ( Frey and Suki 2008 ). These may be short (hours or days), often in relation to triggers of attacks, as well as long (months or years). Lessons from other environmental factors (smoking, occupation) have already shown effects on asthma through acute or subchronic exposures. For example, there is increasing evidence of the role of occupational exposure in the various forms of work-related asthma, which encompasses both occupational asthma starting in adulthood and work-exacerbated asthma ( Henneberger et al. 2011 ). The role of occupational exposure has clearly been evidenced in adult-onset asthma assessed in a birth cohort that was followed until adulthood ( Ghosh et al. 2013 ). The follow-up of the numerous birth cohorts initiated in the 1990s and still followed will likely help us understand the various evolutions of the disease.\nOur study considered multiple cohorts across Europe, which increased statistical power. However, this also gave potential for larger population heterogeneity, increasing the potential for confounding and therefore bias in the effect estimates. Particular characteristics of each cohort may have influenced the results, such as the health consciousness and high education of the women in E3N or the greater baseline risk of asthma for members of asthmatic families in EGEA. Indeed, as shown in Figure 2 , associations were usually largest in EGEA, reaching statistical significance for NO2—although this finding was not robust to the exclusion of the 5% most extreme exposure values (data not shown). To investigate cohort-specific influences on results, we formally tested heterogeneity among cohorts and also looked at the robustness of the findings by removing each cohort in turn, which showed some modest variation.\nOverall, nearly all the sensitivity and stratified analyses led to ORs > 1. Results from stratified analyses should be interpreted with caution because of the limited number of incident cases in subgroups in some cohorts, and none of the p-values for interaction were significant (p > 0.35). Surprisingly, the estimates tended to decrease when restricting the analysis to nonmovers for NO2 but not for PM10. This could be attributable to the lower percentage of movers in E3N and the lack of standardization of moving assessment.\nOur results were sensitive to the statistical approach chosen to account for the clustered data, namely using fixed versus random effects for study city/area. Which of the two modeling approaches provides more valid results is difficult to determine, but one factor may be the nature of the air pollutant variation in regards to the within- versus between-city/area. Fixed city/area–effect models estimate purely within-city/area air pollution effects, whereas random-effects models estimate a weighted average of between- and within-city/area effects ( Neuhaus and Kalbfleisch 1998 ). The difference between both approaches within our analyses was driven by the ECRHS estimates, possibly explained by the higher between-city/area variation in air pollutant concentration in this European cohort. Further analyses, including simulation studies, are warranted to better address this statistical issue in the context of the air pollution effect estimates.\nCompared with other published results for NO2, our confidence intervals largely overlapped those from other studies [OR for 10 μg/m3 of NO2 = 1.10 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.20) compared with 1.54 (95% CI: 1.00, 2.36) in RHINE ( Modig et al. 2009 ) and 1.43 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.01) in ECRHS ( Jacquemin et al. 2009b ) and OR for 5.8 ppb of NO2 (i.e., 11 μg/m3) = 1.12 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.30) in a cohort of U.S. women ( Young et al. 2014 )]. Interestingly, the association with NO2 tended to increase when controlling for PM10 concentration. Two of the six cohorts included in our analyses had previously assessed associations between air pollution and asthma incidence in adults. In ECRHS, a positive and significant association was found between individually assigned air pollution exposure derived from a 1 × 1 km air pollution map (APMoSPHERE) and asthma incidence defined in a similar way to ESCAPE ( Jacquemin et al. 2009b ) and also in an alternative way based on asthma symptoms ( Jacquemin et al. 2009a ). One possible reason for seeing consistently stronger associations with APMoSPHERE based analyses is that APMoSPHERE used air pollution data closer in time to the collection of health data. Alternatively, a spatially less resolved model may better account for the time activity patterns in adult populations; thus, “background” air pollutant exposure estimates could be a better proxy of the mean individual exposure compared with the very local exposure estimates at the home address, produced by the ESCAPE modeling strategy. SAPALDIA ( Künzli et al. 2009 ) reported significant associations between asthma incidence in never-smokers and individually assigned changes in a specifically modeled marker termed “traffic related PM10.” ESCAPE had no such marker, so direct comparisons cannot be made. Moreover, only three SAPALDIA areas were included in ESCAPE—and only one with PM—whereas all previous SAPALDIA results were based on the eight areas the cohort had been designed for in 1990.\nVarious mechanisms have been proposed to explain the associations of air pollution with asthma. Active ongoing research is being conducted to disentangle the various asthma phenotypes and assess which mechanisms may be specifically involved. Because childhood-onset asthma is more often associated with allergic sensitization, it could be hypothesized that allergy-related mechanisms influence childhood asthma relapsing in adulthood. However, recent results from ESCAPE in children up to 10 years of age did not show evidence of associations of air pollution exposure with allergic sensitization ( Gruzieva et al. 2014 ). This suggests that nonallergic mechanisms, for which interest is increasing for asthma at any age, are particularly important to consider. Increased frailty of the epithelial barrier, inflammation, oxidative stress, and interaction with genetic and epigenetic determinants have been proposed. Research in adults, including subjects from the cohorts included in our analysis, has suggested a role of air pollution in local inflammation measured in exhaled breath condensate and induced sputum (using ESCAPE exposure estimates) ( Vossoughi et al. 2014 ), interaction with oxidative stress genes ( Castro-Giner et al. 2009 ), or novel DNA methylation markers ( Sofer et al. 2013 ). Ambitious programs with comprehensive environmental exposure assessment and biological markers are starting in childhood populations ( Vrijheid et al. 2014 ). Altogether, adult-onset asthma is only one of the various asthma phenotypes, and comprehensive life course approaches should be developed at the environmental and phenotypic levels.\nConclusion\nWith > 23,000 adults across Europe followed for 10 years, including 1,257 incident cases of asthma, this is the largest study to estimate the association between traffic-related air pollution, assessed using a standardized and validated method at the individual level, and asthma incidence in adults. Our findings provide suggestive but no firm evidence for a role of air pollution exposure on asthma incidence in adults. Further research with improved individual-level exposure assessment (taking into account, for example, time–activity patterns) and phenotypic characterization in a life-course perspective is needed to better understand the effect of air pollutants on asthma.\nReferences\nAckermann-Liebrich U, Kuna-Dibbert B, Probst-Hensch NM, Schindler C, Felber Dietrich D, Stutz EZ, et al. 2005.

The flexibility of an electric drivetrain would have a negative effect on the blended brake control performance. In this study, models of the powertrain system of an electric car equipped with an axle motor are developed. Based on these models, the transfer characteristics of the motor torque in the driveline and its effect on blended braking control performance are analysed. To further enhance a vehicle's brake performance and energy efficiency, blended braking control algorithms with compensation for the powertrain flexibility are proposed using an extended Kalman filter. These algorithms are simulated under normal deceleration braking. The results show that the brake performance and blended braking control accuracy of the vehicle are significantly enhanced by the newly proposed algorithms.\n""","7.3447065","""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00423114.2014.938663""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

In particular, the challenges posed by unmanned marine vehicles in order to increase the level of autonomy include automatic obstacle avoidance and conformance with the Rules of the Road when navigating in the presence of other maritime traffic. The USV Master Plan which has been established for the US Navy outlines a list of objectives for improving autonomy in order to increase mission diversity and reduce the amount of supervisory intervention. This paper addresses the specific development needs based on notable research carried out to date, primarily with regard to navigation, guidance, control and motion planning. The integration of the International Regulations for Avoiding Collisions at Sea within the obstacle avoidance protocols seeks to prevent maritime accidents attributed to human error. The addition of these critical safety measures may be key to a future growth in demand for USVs, as they serve to pave the way for establishing legal policies for unmanned vessels.\nDOI\nUSVs; COLREGs; Autonomy; Collision avoidance; Guidance; Motion planning\nProjects\nResearch output: Chapter in Book/Report/Conference proceeding › Conference contribution\nFingerprint\nT: +44 (0)28 9024 5133\nEmergency T: +44 (0)28 9097 2222\n© Queen's University Belfast 2017,\n""","0.46771437","""http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/a-review-on-improving-the-autonomy-of-unmanned-surface-vehicles-through-intelligent-collision-avoidance-manoeuvres(c0f5b13f-c545-4576-b571-ba7573862552).html""","[-5.934759,54.583863]"

The stop/start technology switches off the engine to whenever the vehicle is at a stand-still, typically in a highly-congested area of an urban driving. The inherent issue with the implementation of stop/start technology in Southeast Asia, with tropical climate such as Malaysia, is the constant demand for the air-conditioning system. This inevitably reduces the duration of engine switch-off when the vehicle at stop and consequently nullifying the benefit of the stop/start system. On the other hand, cylinder deactivation technology improves the fuel consumption at certain conditions during low to medium vehicle speeds, when the engine is at part load operation only. This study evaluates the fuel economy benefit between the stop/start and cylinder deactivation technologies for the actual Kuala Lumpur urban driving conditions in Malaysia. Malaysia is chosen as a case study to represent a typical urban environment in Southeast Asia. A 1.6 L PFI 4-cylinder engine is modeled in one-dimensional gas dynamics software to predict the fuel consumption. A transient driving profile obtained from the actual road test over the Kuala Lumpur route is simulated and the fuel consumption is compared with New European Drive Cycle (NEDC). The results provide useful insight and enable manufacturers to assess and consider which of the two technologies offers more impact on the fuel economy and the challenges under urban driving in Southeast Asia conditions.\nEvent:\n""","1.0","""http://papers.sae.org/2017-01-0986/""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

The origins of this behaviour, however, have not been specified. A model is therefore introduced, where celeration is partly due to the individual disposition of the driver (i.e., driving style), and partly to the environment (road layout, rules and traffic density). Three measurement problems for celeration were studied; the effect of traffic density, of regular versus irregular routes, and weight of the vehicle (loaded/unloaded) on celeration behaviour. Two small samples of truck drivers in Sweden were measured for several months each. There was a strong effect of vehicle load, with behaviour being more cautious with increased weight. Driving on different roads also yielded differences in behaviour, although the design used did not permit conclusions about what caused these. Traffic volume was not found to have any reliable effect on celeration.\n""","0.94872373","""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10803548.2015.1017953""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

Several operating modes can be achieved by changing the on-off states of the switches in the front-end circuit. In generator driving mode, the battery bank is employed to elevate the phase voltage for fast excitation and demagnetization. In battery driving mode, the converter is reconfigured as a four-level converter, and the capacitor is used as an additional charge capacitor to produce multilevel voltage outputs, which enhances the torque capability. The operating modes of the proposed drive are explained and the phase current and voltage are analyzed in details. The battery charging is naturally achieved by the demagnetization current in motoring mode and by the regenerative current in braking mode. Moreover, the battery can be charged by the external AC source or generator through the proposed converter when the vehicle is in standstill condition. The SRM-based PHEV can operate at different speeds by coordinating the power flow between the generator and battery. Simulation in MATLAB/Simulink and experiments on a three-phase 12/8 SRM confirm the effectiveness of the proposed converter topology.\nDocuments\nIntegrated multilevel converter for switched reluctance motor drives\nRights statement: © 2016 IEEE.

Switched reluctance motors (SRMs) are one of promised motors for EV applications. In order to extend the EVs’ driving miles, the use of photovoltaic (PV) panels on the vehicle helps decrease the reliance on vehicle batteries. Based on phase winding characteristics of SRMs, a tri-port converter is proposed in this paper to control the energy flow between the PV panel, battery and SRM. Six operating modes are presented, four of which are developed for driving and two for standstill on-board charging. In the driving modes, the energy decoupling control for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the PV panel and speed control of the SRM are realized. In the standstill charging modes, a grid-connected charging topology is developed without a need for external hardware. When the PV panel directly charges the battery, a multi-section charging control strategy is used to optimize energy utilization. Simulation results based on Matlab/Simulink and experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed tri-port converter, which has potential economic implications to improve the market acceptance of EVs.\nDocuments\nSolar PV-Powered SRM Drive for EVs with Flexible Energy Control Functions\nRights statement: © 2015 IEEE.

"""The_University_of_Edinburgh""","""Effects of Air Pollution and the Introduction of the London Low Emission Zone on the Prevalence of Respiratory and Allergic Symptoms in Schoolchildren in East London - Edinburgh Research Explorer""","""Published - 21 Aug 2015\nAbstract\nThe adverse effects of traffic-related air pollution on children's respiratory health have been widely reported, but few studies have evaluated the impact of traffic-control policies designed to reduce urban air pollution. We assessed associations between traffic-related air pollutants and respiratory/allergic symptoms amongst 8-9 year-old schoolchildren living within the London Low Emission Zone (LEZ). Information on respiratory/allergic symptoms was obtained using a parent-completed questionnaire and linked to modelled annual air pollutant concentrations based on the residential address of each child, using a multivariable mixed effects logistic regression analysis. Exposure to traffic-related air pollutants was associated with current rhinitis: NOx (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02), NO2 (1.03, 1.00-1.06), PM10 (1.16, 1.04-1.28) and PM2.5 (1.38, 1.08-1.78), all per μg/m3 of pollutant, but not with other respiratory/allergic symptoms. The LEZ did not reduce ambient air pollution levels, or affect the prevalence of respiratory/allergic symptoms over the period studied. These data confirm the previous association between traffic-related air pollutant exposures and symptoms of current rhinitis. Importantly, the London LEZ has not significantly improved air quality within the city, or the respiratory health of the resident population in its first three years of operation. This highlights the need for more robust measures to reduce traffic emissions.\n""","0.026071003","""http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/effects-of-air-pollution-and-the-introduction-of-the-london-low-emission-zone-on-the-prevalence-of-respiratory-and-allergic-symptoms-in-schoolchildren-in-east-london(059ed62e-707d-4205-8932-3bacde5d111b).html""","[-3.187347,55.947691]"

To achieve high regeneration efficiency and also guarantee vehicle's brake safety, the regenerative brake should be coordinated with the mechanical brake. Therefore, the regenerative braking control performance can be significantly affected by the structure of mechanical braking system and the brake blending control strategy.By-wire brake system, which mechanically decouples the brake pedal from the hydraulic brake circuits, can make the braking force modulation more flexible. Moreover, its inherent characteristic of ‘pedal-decouple’ makes it well suited for the implementation in the cooperative regenerative braking control of electrified vehicles.With the aims of regeneration efficiency and braking performance, a regenerative braking control algorithm for electrified vehicles equipped with a brake-by-wire system is researched in this paper. The layout of the adopted brake-by-wire system is introduced. The proposed regenerative braking control algorithm is illustrated. To validate the control performance of the algorithm, hardware-in-the-loop simulations are carried out. The simulation results show that, based on brake-by-wire system, the proposed control algorithm, coordinating regenerative brake and hydraulic brake well, can further improving the regeneration efficiency of electrified vehicle and guarantee the braking performance in the meantime.\nEvent:\n""","0.42577025","""http://papers.sae.org/2014-01-1791/""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"
"""Cranfield_University""","""A review of key planning and scheduling in the rail industry in Europe and UKProceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part F: Journal of Rail and Rapid Transit - Christopher Turner, Ashutosh Tiwari, Andrew Starr, Kevin Blacktop, 2016""","""Download in PowerPoint\nFigure 1. Planning and scheduling activities relevant to the rail industry.\nThe think tank group was made up of senior representatives of Network Rail and other corporate partners of the wider AUTONOM project. Of particular interest to this group was the area of planning and scheduling in relation to autonomous systems and the potential advantages such systems can bring. The four areas shown in Figure 1 demonstrate the potential for automation and have been highlighted as priority areas by Network Rail and the authors. The following subject areas are investigated in more detail in relation to the elements outlined in Figure 1 .\nAutonomous systems\nSuch systems may range from semi-automated to totally autonomous (without human intervention) operation. Semi-automated operation includes European train control system (ETCS) in-cab signalling and automated train braking systems. Fully automated operation examples include the automated operation of trains.\nData mining\nThe practice of data mining is the identification of structural patterns in data and links between data points that are not readily discoverable. Rail industry data collected from train-based and wayside sensors provide a vast potential repository for data mining.\nKnowledge engineering frameworks\nKnowledge engineering is similar to the discipline of software engineering; it turns the process of constructing knowledge-based systems from an art into an engineering discipline. Such practice is required in the design of new information management systems for rail.\nExpert and decision support systems\nAn expert system is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert; they can also provide decision-making support. A decision support system aids a user in their decision-making by providing possible solutions for a problem area. Decision support can be seen in the use of more sophisticated rail scheduling software.\nSemantic technologies\nOntologies can be thought of as maps between vocabularies that allow document creators to know how to describe their documents. The wide variety of protocols for the transfer of data in rail applications provides the opportunity for semantic description of such data to aid interoperability.\nPlanning and scheduling: Approaches that can be applied\nSection:\nPlanning and scheduling is a wide subject area relating to both manufacturing and service industries (Pinedo 1 ). In manufacturing one of the most common uses of scheduling is in the flow shop. Cheng et al. 2 describe such a case where the scheduling of jobs through batch processing machines is considered. Within the rail industry scheduling can apply to a variety of topics as evidenced in Figure 1 . The work of Cao et al. 3 examines the problem of mixed-speed train scheduling on a high-speed line; where the flow of trains, travelling at different rates along a rail line, must be continuous. Rail maintenance scheduling has been addressed by Lautala and Pouryousef 4 who describe a preventive maintenance scheduling problem modelling approach for preventative maintenance. In this approach parameters related to specific line specifications, drawn from three high-speed line case studies, are defined as a series of descriptive analytical tables. One of the more recent areas for investigation in relation to rail industry scheduling problems has been the use of soft computing techniques. Hu et al. 5 propose a scheduling approach utilising a particle swarm algorithm to optimise the scheduling within an urban rail network, based on data hosted in a cloud repository.\nAutonomous systems\nAutonomous systems can contain complex control logic often incorporating computational intelligence techniques such as fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms. Such systems are linked to physical objects to provide sensing capabilities, to control the motion of mobile hardware assets and activities of both fixed and mobile assets. Agents are one avenue of research for the autonomous control of assets. Agents are said to embody two principles: an ability to act autonomously and the capability to interact with other agents (Wooldridge 6 ). Multi-agent systems are then, by definition, interacting collections of agents (Wooldridge 6 ).\nFisher 7 has investigated the design and evaluation of agents providing a framework for the temporal execution of agent designs. This work was motivated by the lack of such a framework and methods to assess the actual behaviour of agents once designed.\nLearning algorithms have also been employed in the control of autonomous systems. Reinforcement learning is likened by Sutton 8 to a mapping between situations and actions in response to a reward. Reinforcement learning is prominent in autonomous control research and agent theory. Policy search is a technique from the area of reinforcement learning in which a probability distribution is assigned to a set of possible actions. Deisenroth and Rasmussen 9 put forward an approach for data-efficient policy search and apply it to control tasks such as the cart-pole learning task.\nThe subject of autonomous real-time planning has been investigated by Cresswell et al. 10 in their work on the learning object-centred models system. Automated planning has also been investigated by Fernandez et al. 11 who propose an architecture for the automation of data mining tasks. Again the Planning Domain Definition language features heavily in this approach. The papers included in this section so far, while not currently applied to rail uses, do hold some potential for further investigation with regards to autonomous rail research. There are only limited investigations into full autonomous operation within the railway industry, usually concentrating on automatic operation of metro/light rail systems as in Dominguez et al. 12 and Wackrow and Slamen. 13 Opportunities exist to review maintenance planning and scheduling, among other activities, with a view to autonomous or semi-autonomous operation.\nData mining\nThe area of data mining has increased in importance in-line with the increasing ability for information systems to capture and preserve data. In tandem with this is the maturing of computational intelligence techniques used for the identification of patterns in the collected data (Witten and Frank 14 ). The rail industry is both a producer of data and a user of the knowledge extracted from such data sets.\nThe work of Goverde and Meng 15 utilises train describer records (describer records contain operational information about the track and train movements) to improve the performance of infrastructure and train services. This paper outlines tools for the mining of train describer data, and its analysis, for the purpose of increasing capacity, punctuality and reliability while improving safety. Of interest in this area is the mining of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data. SCADA systems are employed in a range of industrial scenarios including rail (Hadžiosmanovic et al. 16 ). The work of Hadžiosmanovic et al. 16 mines SCADA data in a workflow-centric manner with regard to the identification of anomalous log traces that could indicate incorrect use of the system or a potential security breach.\nThe mining of rail data in the form of business processes is explored by Kecman and Goverde. 17 Train describer event data is mined by a process mining tool to provide a more informed analysis of potential train path conflicts (to minimise disruptions to trains in the network and improve safety). Business process mining aims to rediscover a process from event log data (recorded executions of business processes) typically drawn from enterprise software systems. The practice of business process mining is further described in Van der Aalst and Weijters 18 and a range of techniques are referenced in Tiwari et al. 19\nKnowledge engineering frameworks and ontology\nKnowledge engineering concerns the practice of designing and building knowledge-based systems. In the opinion of Studer et al. 20 the practice of knowledge engineering (KE) should adopt formal structured approaches inherent in a discipline such as software engineering. In essence KE has, since the work of Studer et al., 20 become a discipline that has its own set of frameworks and methodological approach. Studer et al. 20 mentions three frameworks for knowledge engineering: CommonKADS, MIKE and PROTEGE-II.\nA critical component of KE is the use of semantic technologies utilising XML meta-descriptions of objects and ontologies, enabling an enhanced level of contextual meaning to be expressed through knowledge systems. Ontologies, in particular, have had a significant role to play in semantic web technologies and in the use of computational intelligence techniques in KE. Ontologies can be thought of as a type of dictionary that links together corresponding words in different vocabularies, allowing document creators to know how best to describe their documents. As Antoniou and van Harmelen 21 put it ‘an ontology consists of a finite list of terms and the relationships between these terms’. This can make such documents, at least partially, machine understandable with the application of artificial intelligence algorithms.\nThe case for the use of ontologies in rail industry applications is made by Easton et al.; 22 in that the proliferation of legacy systems in the industry together with the range of alternative terms used by different parties to refer to the same entity make ontology use highly desirable. An example use of ontologies in the rail industry is given by Briola et al. 23 These authors utilise ontologies, along with natural language processing, to manage traffic control within a railway network (using representative test data sets). Work by Zarri et al. 24 examines the generation of business rules from a semantic knowledge system for use in the checking of hazardous materials being transported by rail. In this work the ontological approach aids the development and structuring of If/Then rules concerning the checking of hazardous materials transported in rail wagons.\nSemantic technologies\nSemantic technologies rely on ontologies for their definition and context. Semantic languages often employ XML as a framework due to its ability to provide a structured meta-description for combination with or attachment to another digital object. Bousse et al. 25 extend one such semantic language, SysML (systems modeling language), for use with rail safety systems. The case study described by Bousse et al. 25 concerns a railway crossing controller made up of a set of sensors fitted to a level crossing. The SysML specification is modified with suitable additions to describe the correct monitoring and functioning of the crossing. The modelling of such safety control systems in the rail industry may be carried out in a language such as UML. Berkenkötter and Hannemann 26 outline an approach utilising UML 2.0 for such a task, utilising semantic descriptions. The use of such a modelling paradigm with a semantic XML description could provide a powerful tool for the exploration, verification and enforcement of a control system. Network Rail have also been investigating the use of the IEC 61850 standard used by the electrical supply industry in their use of XML coding as a communication interface between power supply systems and controllers (Burnham 27 ) with the aim of being able to remotely monitor the condition of suitably equipped power supply systems within the network.\nSemantic process mining is another recent extension of an existing technique with ontological and semantic capabilities. Jareevongpiboon and Janecek 28 concentrate on the direct addition of semantics to business processes. With this technique business process event logs are annotated with ontologically defined concept descriptions. A number of ontological resources are utilised for the annotation: a domain ontology (for the domain concerning the business processes); company ontology (containing company-specific definitions) and definitions from relevant databases (Jareevongpiboon and Janecek). 28\nSemantic technologies provide a new method of data description for potential use in the rail industry. Many data interchange standards still exist in the rail networks of Europe and semantics provide the potential for providing a harmonised way of exchanging information between different systems; a useful requirement, considering the range of technologies being introduced in both rail vehicles and trackside, when considering their intelligent control.\nExpert and decision support systems\nExpert systems within the rail industry can take many forms and may be used to address a number of areas. Saa et al. 29 outline an ontology-driven expert decision support system for the design of railway electrification systems. This approach is based on the development of a knowledge database composed of expert views and used to inform the design process. The intended automation of the collection and use of expert views will be facilitated though the further development and use of a rules engine. Such systems may also be autonomous in their operation, and are often employed in the task of monitoring assets. Palte 30 makes the point that remote vehicle monitoring systems, for rail vehicles, must be capable of communicating their collected data and analysis in an informative and appropriate way to interested parties; Palte 30 presents a commentary of a number of salient factors for designers of such monitoring systems to take into account. Zhang 31 puts forward a framework for the monitoring of maintenance, repair and operation (MRO) activities regarding high-speed trains. This approach, based on the use of radio frequency identification sensors, utilises complex event processing and semantics to evaluate the efficiency of MRO activities. Condition monitoring of rail vehicles is also the subject of the work of Firlik et al. 32 who examine light rail systems from this perspective. This paper examines the dynamic adjustment of maintenance needs and track speed limits based on sensor readings from axle boxes. Such autonomous functionality is still new in the rail industry, with only the most recent papers giving serious attention to it.\nIntelligent decision support systems are now becoming a reality in the rail industry. Ngigi et al. 33 detail the progress in predictive control methods and their relevance to condition monitoring activities related to rail. Such systems can be used to support decisions on when to perform maintenance and renewals tasks. In particular a class of algorithms known as model predictive control (MPC) attempt to optimise future behaviour of assets by computing a sequence of modified actions. One such control method is the Kalman filter, which has been utilised in the assessment of the dynamic performance of rail vehicle components while in motion. In addition wheelset condition monitoring (WCM) systems are now used to assess a range of wheel-related degradation instances and include systems such as: wheel impact detectors, hot axle bearing detection, brake pad inspection systems and automatic vehicle identification systems. The authors acknowledge that the combination of WCM and simulation techniques is required for high-performance real-time condition monitoring of rail vehicles and the support of maintenance decisions.\nOne interesting development, with possible application to safety uses in the rail industry, is the introduction of the European GALILEO satellite navigation system. This system will potentially be a rival for the global positioning system (GPS) and, unlike standard GPS, will in time be certified for use in railway safety applications (Beugin et al. 34 ). The work of Beugin et al. 34 envisages a time when all trains will be fitted with intelligent communication systems capable of transmitting their real-time position and health to control centres. Safety-critical situations, such as velocity of a train in speed-restricted sections of lines and location of a train within signalling blocks, are potential application areas for real-time location technology (Beugin et al. 34 ).\nPlanning and scheduling applied to rail research subject areas\nSection:\nTimetable planning\nTimetable planning is an active area of research for the rail industry. The work of Yang et al. 35 investigates the development of incomplete cyclic timetables for trains. Real-time re-scheduling of trains is the subject of Wegele et al., 36 where genetic algorithms are used to perform a heuristic re-ordering of trains when delays are encountered in the rail network. The mark-up language RailML is also mentioned in this work. RailML is a metadata language, utilising XML, which defines a set of common rail-specific terminology as meta descriptions. RailML is only mentioned in a few papers at present (RailML is detailed in Nash et al. 37 ). The practice behind train dispatching is outlined by Kuckelberg and Wendler 38 who aim to address the conflicts that arise when trains block each other due to delays. These authors provide an algorithmic software tool incorporating a strategy building approach to conflict resolution and a system framework.\nThe timetabling problem is framed by Ho et al., 39 as one of multi-objective optimisation in that a feasible solution must be identified within a limited time constraint that satisfies a number of objectives. Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is used to design a timetable for a railway network that operates as an open market (an open market network usually consists of an infrastructure provider and a number of competing train operating companies). In PSO optimisation each particle in a swarm represents a potential solution to an optimisation problem through its location within the swarm (Ho et al. 39 ). The optimisation of timetables has also been addressed by Forsgren et al. 40 who provide an optimisation tool that is also capable of conflict resolution. In this approach, existing timetables are fed in and then optimised while still allowing timetable planners to make their own adjustments. Albrecht et al. 41 take an approach to timetable revision that involves the use of a problem space search heuristic to generate alternative solutions. This approach is particularly relevant to re-scheduling situations due to track and infrastructure maintenance needs. The simulation of rail systems to aid planning and timetable design has been investigated by Besinovic et al. 42 who aim to determine real train running time and speed profiles. In the work of Pellegrini et al., 43 who propose a simulation model utilising mixed-integer linear programming, the area of train routing and scheduling for complex rail junctions is explored. This research aims to achieve optimised routing for trains in the event of unexpected disruptions to track availability. Different levels of granularity (locking of routes and of just track sections) were considered. The locking of track sections involved in the finer granularity gave higher-quality solutions (shorter delays). In future work the authors aim to use the model in a rolling-horizon framework. The mixed integer linear programing construct is also deployed in a simulation by Rudan et al. 44 who investigate the area of dynamic railway scheduling. A number of constraints are considered in this work describing the normal scheduled operation of trains, including time taken at junctions, dwell time at stations and timetabled journey commencement. On average a 30% reduction in delays can be achieved using this approach. Another advantage of this approach is its ability to highlight the most delay-prone trains in the network. Additional work in this area includes Ruan et al. 45 who utilise a genetic algorithm approach to determine the parameters that should be examined by a rail system simulation, in terms of safety-critical operation.\nA salient point is made by Crevier et al. 46 in that the financially viable operation of rail networks normally involves the inclusion of freight services and that such services can present scheduling challenges. The combination of network scheduling and pricing is considered in this work with a mixed-integer approach presented and the consideration of two pricing policies, disjoint (separate prices are given for each itinerary) and common (where a common tariff is used for all itineraries). From this research, it was found that a disjoint pricing policy provided more revenue, with future work concentrating on the ability of the customer to select a tariff. This research is one of the few works to consider profitable freight pricing with scheduling.\nThe area of rail yards is in part the subject of Marinov et al. 47 who examine the use of simulation software to model rail timetable and network management decisions. This paper describes common yard types and approaches to modelling common factors such as wagon speeds, section lengths and train manoeuvring parameters. The further work of Marinov and Viegas 48 examines the simulation of rail freight by examining the rail network as a set of entities (such as yards, stations, lines) and looks at the queuing situations at each entity.\nScheduling of trains in terms of energy-efficiency goals is another active area of interest and one such approach is described in the work of Hu et al. 5 This approach utilises a combination of a standard multi-objective optimisation algorithm and a fuzzy multi-objective optimisation approach to find train allocations and movements that balance fuel efficiency with passenger travel time. Timetable and planning robustness related to the movement of long-haul trains is the subject of the work of Pudney et al. 49 who utilise a Monte Carlo approach to locomotive movements in the Australian rail network.\nTrain control systems\nOne of the major developments in train control systems in recent years has been the European rail traffic management system (ERTMS). The ERTMS system is composed of two main entities, the European train control system (ETCS) and global system for mobile communications-railway (GSM-R) (Abed 50 ). ETCS is comprised of two main components, the automatic train protection system (automated emergency braking at red signals) and signalling system (in-cab signalling). GSM-R is an international standard for mobile voice and data communication transmission in a railway environment and primarily used for train to control centre communication. The different levels of ERTMS are detailed in Abed. 50\nAn interesting paper in the area of certification of ERTMS systems for installation in European rail networks has been produced by Jabri et al. 51 This paper puts forward a method based on a combination of UML (Unified Modelling Language) and Petri nets for this purpose.\nAlternative train control systems are being developed outside of Europe. In Baba et al. 52 the advanced train administration and communications system is outlined. This system, developed by Hitachi and the East Japan Railway Company, operates in a similar way to ERTMS and corresponds to level 3 of the European system (Baba et al. 52 ).\nEnergy conservation is another recent topic for research within the field of train control systems. According to Xun et al. 53 there are four types of energy saving actions that can take place within train operation.\nEnergy efficient train driving style.\nCoordination of trains in real-time.\nTimetabling for energy efficiency.\nInclusion of energy efficiency goals in planning activities.\nXun et al. 53 point to the use of re-generative breaking to contribute to energy savings and define two types of control for this mode; train dwell time and train running time (these two types are discussed in more detail in Wong and Ho 54 ). Xun et al. 53 stress the importance of fully automated operation of trains running within such an energy-efficient system. Further work by Park et al. 55 examines the prediction of energy consumption related to the driving of electric trains in the Korean rail network through the utilisation of simulation techniques. An optimal train driving strategy is also put forward by Bocharnikov et al. 56 who examine this area in relation to electrically powered suburban railways. This technique utilises a genetic algorithm to identify optimal train trajectories from a set of simulations. In addition energy-efficient driving of trains is the subject of the work of Ke et al. 57 who look at this subject in relation to rapid transit systems with the aim of optimising speed of service with the need for reduced energy consumption.\nThe modelling and verification of control systems for high-speed trains is a necessary step in the assurance of the safe operation of modern rail lines. Lv et al. 58 put forward such a model capable of describing hybrid systems that compose most modern high-speed train control systems. Train protection systems and the problem of train over-speed has been the subject of research by Guo et al. 59 In this work the authors describe the simulation of a train protection system with the aim of reducing the development time of a working real life system.\nAlthough this area is dominated by ERTMS and ETCS, it should be noted that additional systems are also relevant in the delivery of safe and efficient train control, such as those involved in efficient driving strategies for rail vehicles.\nRailway infrastructure\nIncreasingly the rail industry is looking to autonomous and intelligent systems to address the maintenance needs of its infrastructure. According to Dadashi et al. 59 this introduction of intelligent infrastructure has been brought about by the need to move from reactive to diagnostic and prognostic modes of railway maintenance where faults are predicted and potentially designed out of the system (Dadashi et al. 60 ). Three main uses of intelligent infrastructure have been highlighted by Dadashi et al.: 60\ndata acquisition: to obtain data from fixed assets such as signals, bridges and points;\nhealth assessment: to ascertain the health status of the aforementioned fixed assets;\nadvisory notification: to deliver diagnostic and prognostic information to operators and add to a decision support knowledge base.\nFurther to these definitions Dadashi et al. 60 provides an outline data processing framework for intelligent railway infrastructure. Rail inspection is a substantive topic for research; Popović et al. 61 gives a comprehensive overview of the subject with regard to common rail defects. Rail maintenance is also the subject of Bouillaut et al. 62 who provide an approach and a decision support tool for the reliability maintenance of underground rail tracks. The approach taken in this work is to utilise a Bayesian network for the modelling of maintenance strategies to detect and prevent broken rails. In addition the work of Guler 63 describes a decision support system for railway track maintenance and renewal programmes, which is comprised of rules developed from interviews with track experts and secondary research sources. Nystrom and Soderholm 64 present a method for the prioritisation of railway maintenance actions. Zhao et al. 65 also examine scheduling activities in the form of synchronised rail track component renewal. In this work they utilise a genetic algorithm approach to optimise track renewal activities; thus, minimising the cost incurred and track possession time.\nThe automated inspection of rail track is the subject of the work of Li et al. 66 who present a method to detect track components using a computer-vision-based system. In addition GPS data along with a distance measurement instrument are used to improve the accuracy of track components detection. Rail ties and anchors are vital components in the attachment of rails to track. These components must be in a good maintenance condition and have the correct spacing to make the track safe. The system can achieve up to 99% accuracy in the identification of rail ties. Future work includes the use of a modified imaging system and improved track illumination in order to reduce the number of false-positive readings recorded. Another example of automated track inspection is given by Resendiz et al. 67 who have developed an algorithm that can identify periodically occurring track components. Signal processing and a spectral estimation technique are used in the development of the technique. The MUSIC (multiple signal classification) technique was selected in this research due to its ability to detect multiple repeating instances in data streams containing noise. Future work aims to develop the system to a level of accuracy where it can operate autonomously.\nA major safety concern for rail networks is the stability of the track. In the work of Ahmad et al. 68 a track stability management tool is developed for the assessment of temperature and amount of track deformation. A margin of safety, along with a range of allowable temperature tolerances for tracks, has been calculated in this work that allows for decisions to be made on when maintenance teams are to be sent out on inspections and when the setting of speed limits in hot weather is appropriate.\nTrack geometry inspection technology is the subject of the work of Li et al. 69 who propose a neural network technique to recognise complex patterns between track geometry and vehicle response. Their performance-based track geometry inspection system relates track geometry and vehicle speed to actual vehicle performance in real-time. This system has been tested against historical data of past derailments and vehicle performance issues related to track geometry.\nOne novel development for rail maintenance is the use of handheld computers to display rail-specific special information such as track layouts (Dadashi et al. 70 ). Such a system could be used to highlight danger areas and prominent landmarks to line workers who do not have local knowledge of a particular work site. Dadashi et al. 70 put forward the point that electronic layouts are more practical than paper-based ones for night working and working in bad weather conditions.\nSignalling systems\nBeyond the area of train control systems, such as ETCS, considerable research has been carried out in the area of signalling and its analysis for safety-related purposes. The work of Filip et al. 71 examines the use of global navigation satellite systems (GNNS) in relation to railway safety applications. In this study the authors examine the applicability of existing GNSS technologies and their modes for use in the railway industry, highlighting their current limitations. As Filip et al. 72 mentions satellite technology will have a significant impact on the railways, in that the trackside sensor equipment (such as Balaises and hot box sensors) will be superseded by asset-located sensors that determine the actual real-time position via satellite. Filip et al. 72 go on to mention the European Galileo satellite system currently under development and its applicability to railway signalling.\nAs mentioned already railway signalling research has been conducted involving areas such as satellite technology 71 , 72 though there has also been an investigation into the use of Internet protocol for the control of signals reducing the need for the installation of traditional copper wiring (Endo et al. 73 ). The general trend in signalling research is that the real-time location and monitoring of rail asset condition as data inputs to signalling systems is now on the near horizon; though knowledge of the impact on planning and scheduling activities brought about by this new paradigm is not as well-developed. One of the more relevant works in this direction is that of Lai and Wang 74 who address capacity planning from the perspective of new signalling systems and track layout designs. A paper of particular interest as a primer for further planning and scheduling research is that of Dicembre and Ricci 75 who investigate the effect of factors such as signalling and capacity on high-density urban rail corridors. In summary, in the European rail sector, although ETCS (in-train cab signal system) is seen as the future for many main lines it is likely that for cost, and in some cases logistical reasons, traditional track side signalling equipment will remain in branch lines for many decades. This necessitates the need for ongoing maintenance and renewal of such track side assets.\nMaintenance\nAs mentioned by Dadashi et al. 60 there has been a move from reactive to diagnostic and prognostic modes of railway maintenance; where fault diagnosis and prediction are key. As part of this movement work has been conducted into the area of fault states and the interdependencies between the states in Schöbel and Maly. 76 This paper makes clear the need for active monitoring of rail vehicles so logical connections between fault states can be made and acted upon in a timely manner.\nAs in the work of Dadashi et al. 70 (discussed in the infrastructure section) data from assets deployed in the field can increasingly be made available to mobile devices. Bye 77 details the use of mobile devices and the design of application interfaces with case studies drawn from the UK infrastructure provider Network Rail.\nThe subject of risk-centred maintenance is investigated by Selvik and Aven. 78 These authors make the point that reliability-centred maintenance for preventative maintenance practice is well understood in industry, though it does present limitations when used to quantify risk and uncertainty in projects. In order to address this limitation the authors introduce the reliability and risk-centred maintenance framework that provides a methodology for the communication and quantification of risk in maintenance practice. In general a good review of scheduling techniques for preventative maintenance is provided by Soh et al. 79\nThe importance of organisational design in railway maintenance operations is highlighted by Jiang et al. 80 Maintenance operations may be performed by a collection of co-operating organisations, having a model of how such organisations operate together is, in the opinion of Jiang et al. 80 essential. Jiang et al. 80 put forward the OperA + framework, which is an agent-based framework allowing for the creation of dynamic representations of organisational interaction. Such an agent-based approach is said, by Jiang et al. 80 to provide a more accurate model of both real life and future organisation interaction scenarios.\nThe scheduling of rail maintenance teams is the subject of the work of Peng et al. 81 where a time–space network is proposed to optimise the assignment of workers. A number of constraints, drawn from industry practice, are proposed in this work, such as: time windows, travel costs, and parallel execution of projects. Local search algorithms are utilised to solve sub-divisions of the problem space. The work has been applied to a railroad network and has outperformed industry standard manual practices. In future work the authors propose the inclusion of further constraints reflecting latest practice in the rail industry.\nIn Peng et al. 82 the optimal routing and scheduling of periodic inspections in a rail network are explored in the context of long-term planning. A heuristic algorithm is put forward as part of this research that utilises a local search method, thereby allowing for the scheduling problem to be divided into sub sets, as in similar work by Peng and Ouyang. 83 Improved results are found over existing manual techniques, although this approach is only able to add new tasks at the end of the schedule rather than within the schedule.\nSchlake et al. 84 makes the point that wayside monitoring of railcars is essential for the enablement of predictive maintenance practice. This research looked at the economic impact of train delays and the effect of introducing lean production methods on mainline railway operations to improve railcar inspection processes facilitated by monitoring equipment. The cost savings provided by improved maintenance practices were estimated by this study at over $15,000,000 a year.\nThe work of Hajibabai et al. 85 focuses on the mining of data collected from rail carriages utilising wheel impact load detectors and wheel profile detectors. A regression analysis was performed to predict with 90% efficiency high impact wheel train stops within a 30 day period.\nIncreasingly industry is looking towards the provision of support service packages to complement the products that they sell. This product service system approach (which is expanded on in Baines et al. 86 ) involves manufacturers having to calculate the cost of maintaining products over set periods of time. Dersin and Valenzuela 87 describe the use of Petri nets to model the maintenance costs inherent in a rail system. The Petri net models are used in conjunction with a policy planning tool to simulate the processes required for different maintenance policies.\nThe area of semantics and their use in maintenance practice is the research subject of Matsokis et al. 88 A great deal of maintenance-related data held on assets is not described and recorded in any uniform way at present; the work of Matsokis et al. 88 aims to address this issue by providing an ontology model for maintenance practice. Although the authors have not expressly based their work in the rail industry, the applicability of their methodology is implied.\nOpportunities with semantic technology\nSection:\nAs mentioned earlier, the value of knowledge-based systems in the rail industry is rapidly increasing. The use of ontologies and semantic technology increases the potential usefulness of data stores and legacy data repositories. The ability to draw meaning from data in a context-relevant fashion is becoming a new research focus in the industry and is of direct relevance for the development of autonomous systems for rail.\nThe mining of text resources for knowledge has received considerable attention in recent years. In particular, the area of web mining has become popular with organisations using data mining techniques to identify solutions to problems from web-based materials. One such approach is put forward by Thorleuchter and van den Poel 89 who investigate the use of web mining to discover new technological developments based on optimised parameter values. Such a technique could be valuable in the rail industry for the identification of potential solutions from proprietary data sources. Due to the array of potential data sources in the rail industry a web mining approach may allow for unified access to these sources.\nWeb mining is of great relevance to the rail industry as both web and rail industry sources of information may possess varying degrees of structure. Web mining largely involves the mining of unstructured context-rich information from a variety of text-based sources (Cambria et al. 90 ). The mining of personal opinions is one such target of web mining techniques. Cambria et al. 90 explore the subject of sentiment analysis, in which the meaning of personal opinions on social blogs and other sources are sought, using a combination of data mining and other computational techniques.\nIn similar work Mostafa 91 uses text mining coupled with a Lexicon (dictionary) containing words with known sentiment descriptions to mine consumer sentiments about brands recorded in social blogs. Cruz et al. 92 also explore the area of opinion mining using a domain-oriented approach. In their approach Cruz et al. 92 opinions are extracted from user-generated product reviews. The authors find that domain-oriented approaches produce more accurate opinion extraction systems; their approach also utilises a method to determine the polarity and strength of the polarity of reviews. The work of Robaldo and Di Caro 93 is notable here as they provide an XML mark-up language for use in opinion mining called OpinionMining-ML.\nA final example of the use of ontologies in the management of rail systems is provided by Briola et al. 23 who present a semantic architecture for the centralised control of railway traffic. One of the main advantages of this system is the ability for a user to make natural language queries on the data being collected. Two key objectives of this approach are to reduce the overall cost of managing the rail system through autonomous or semi-autonomous operation and the ability to make real-time changes to train movements and their scheduling when encountering problems that may lead to service disruption such as faulty trains and damage within the infrastructure (Briola et al. 23 ).\nAn Analysis of Planning and Scheduling Papers\nSection:\nAlthough the papers reviewed in this paper have been assigned to particular headings based on their central concept many benefit from more than one approach. Table 1 shows a number of opportunities for the use of different technologies within rail industry planning and scheduling activities. From Table 1 it was possible to construct a pie chart of the literature review papers relating to planning and scheduling activities within the rail industry based on the technologies that they utilised. Figure 2 demonstrates that 58% of the papers feature expert and decision support systems, with 14% utilising semantic technologies. From this analysis it can also be seen that more recent papers are now referring to autonomous applications, though they are mainly restricted to applications such as the automatic or semi-automatic operation of metro systems.\n""","0.23700888","""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0954409714565654""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

In order to coordinate the FIWMA and SBW systems, the mechanisms influencing the vehicle dynamics control performance and the energy consumption of the two systems are first derived. Second, the controllers for each subsystem are developed. For the SBW system, a triple-step control technique is implemented to decouple the yaw rate and sideslip angle controls. The FIWMA system controller is designed with a hierarchical control scheme, which is able not only to satisfy the yaw rate and sideslip angle tracking demands, but also to deal with actuation redundancy and constraints. Finally, coordinated control is proposed to obtain the comprehensive optimization of the vehicle dynamics control performance and energy consumption. The developed coordinated control is convenient for implementation as the structures and control algorithms of the subsystems remain unchanged. In this way, the control algorithms of the subsystems can be developed independently. Simulations are carried out with a CarSim software full-vehicle model under two typical driving scenarios, and with different road conditions. The results show the effectiveness of the developed coordinated control.\nAlso in:\n""","10.548218","""http://papers.sae.org/2016-01-0457/""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

This paper considers the perceptions and priorities of local residents about traffic impacts and possible mitigation measures, using as a case study a rural area that will be affected by traffic associated with the construction of a nuclear power station. The study consisted of a qualitative phase followed by a stated preference survey. Econometric models were used to measure the relative priority of different impacts and mitigation measures. The most impactful aspects were noise, vibration, and increased car or bus travel times. The most preferred measures were night-time restrictions to HGVs, parking restrictions, and safety measures for pedestrians and cyclists. There were significant differences in preferences according to residence location, gender, employment status, and household composition. The results provide information about aspects that tend to be aggregated in existing assessment frameworks, separating the reduction of the utility of some activities (like walking and driving) and the suppression of those activities.\nPublication data is maintained in RPS.

At cruising altitudes (about z = 5–12 km), accurate forecasts for turbulence, icing, and convection are critical for reducing extra costs due to in-flight injuries, structural damage, and flight delays by encountering those hazards (e.g., Sharman et al. 2012 ; Sharman and Lane 2016 ). Reliable predictions of upper-level jet and wind variations can also have a significant impact on optimal flight-routing planning ( Kim et al. 2015 ; 2016 ). Near airports, rapidly updated nowcasts from observing and modeling systems are crucial to identify possible low-level wind shear and downburst events, which can cause serious safety issues for departing and landing airplanes (e.g., Wong et al. 2013 ). From a long-term perspective, a better understanding of the two-way interaction between climate change and aviation may help establish a better strategy for green aviation in the future ( Williams 2016 ).\nDespite the importance of research to aviation meteorology, only a few scientific groups internationally are currently studying these topics. To collaborate and promote research activities in aviation meteorology, the Workshop on Aviation Meteorology has been hosted biennially by Yonsei University (YSU) since 2008. The fundamental goal of this workshop is to find pathways to strengthen collaborations among the active research groups, operational weather forecast centers, and stakeholders, which can improve operational forecasting models and observing techniques to better predict and analyze aviation weather hazards and can eventually mitigate the adverse weather impact on aviation.\nThe participants presented and discussed on-going research results on four main themes: 1) development of global aviation turbulence forecasting systems, 2) improvements in modeling and observing systems of aviation meteorology, 3) local weather forecasts and low-level wind shear, and 4) interaction between aviation and climate change.\nDEVELOPMENT OF GLOBAL AVIATION TURBULENCE FORECASTING SYSTEMS.\nSection:\nAt the requests of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and World Meteorological Organization (WMO), two World Area Forecast Centers (WAFCs) in Washington, United States, and London, United Kingdom, have developed the World Area Forecast System (WAFS), which provides automated and consistent gridded forecasts for global aviation users ( Gill 2012 ). In accordance with ICAO’s Aviation System Block Upgrades (ASBU), ICAO/WMO required the update of the current WAFS grids especially to include severity instead of potentials and to provide probability of all hazards with increases in spatial and temporal resolution. Blending these hazard forecasts with output from third-party providers in addition to the two WAFCs will be considered at a later date.\nHye-Yeong Chun from YSU presented the current status of the Korean Aviation Turbulence Guidance (KTG; Kim and Chun 2012 ) product, which forecasts aviation turbulence over East Asia, and outlined future plans to extend it as a global forecasting system, Global-KTG (G-KTG), to be based on the Global Data Assimilation and Prediction System (GDAPS) developed by the Korean Meteorological Administration (KMA). Evaluation over East Asia shows that the KTG performance depends on the season, higher in winter and fall and lower in summer. This is likely because of the lack of proper turbulence diagnostics to capture convectively induced turbulence (CIT) and a seasonal bias in the underlying GDAPS model. In addition, estimation of atmospheric turbulence in the free atmosphere using high vertical resolution radiosonde data (HVRRD), in conjunction with the project of finescale atmospheric processes (FISAPS) from Stratosphere–Troposphere Processes and their Role in Climate (SPARC; Geller et al. 2016 ), and its application to the aviation meteorology was suggested.\nPhilip Gill from the Met Office in the United Kingdom (WAFC London) presented their efforts on ensemble-based global aviation hazard forecasts. Current global forecasts from the two WAFCs are produced from deterministic model output. To communicate forecast uncertainty, the Met Office Global and Regional Ensemble Prediction System (MOGREPS) is used for probabilistic aviation weather forecasts ( Gill and Buchanan 2014 ). Here, a multimodel ensemble combining MOGREPS and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble is used and evaluated using the observed derived equivalent vertical gust (DEVG) from commercial aircraft for verification.\nMatt Strahan from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Aviation Weather Center (NOAA/AWC; WAFC Washington) introduced the missions and roles of the NOAA/AWC for the WAFS upgrades. Jung-Hoon Kim from NOAA/AWC also presented joint efforts with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) for the development of the Global Graphical Turbulence Guidance (G-GTG) for WAFS upgrades. The current WAFS turbulence grid is based on a single turbulence diagnostic, the Ellrod index ( Ellrod and Knapp 1992 ), which does not directly provide turbulence severity and does not directly consider sources of turbulence other than clear-air turbulence (CAT). In contrast, a recent version of GTG ( Sharman and Pearson 2016 ) provides the energy dissipation rate (EDR; m2/3 s–1), a measure of atmospheric turbulence intensity, which is calculated by optimally combining multiple component diagnostics based on various turbulence sources: CAT, mountain wave–induced turbulence (MWT), and possibly CIT. Using NOAA’s Global Forecast System (GFS) and global EDR observational data ( Sharman et al. 2014 ) for one month (October 2015), it was shown that the new global EDR forecast from the G-GTG has better performance skill than the current WAFS turbulence forecast.\nIMPROVEMENTS IN MODELING AND OBSERVING SYSTEMS OF AVIATION METEOROLOGY.\nSection:\nImprovements in forecast performance can be achieved by contributions from careful tunings and evaluations of current algorithms, better observations, development of new diagnostics, upgrades to underlying numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, and better observation-derived products.\nDan-Bi Lee from YSU presented the development of the G-KTG system that combines 10 CAT diagnostics and 2 MWT diagnostics using the GDAPS data. Individual diagnostics are mapped into an EDR scale, based on in situ flight observations ( Sharman and Pearson 2016 ) and GDAPS calculations of each diagnostics. The performance of the G-KTG system is evaluated against global in situ EDR observations from October 2016, and the skill score was shown to be quite good.\nJoel Tenenbaum from the State University of New York (SUNY) discussed the Global Aircraft Dataset (GADS) experiment, which was initiated by contributions from multiple international airlines for verification of winter jets. This has been updated and extended to provide automated DEVG measurements from a European-based airline and is now used for verification of current WAFS turbulence forecasts.\nSoo-Hyun Kim from YSU suggested new near-cloud turbulence (NCT) diagnostics based on the convective gravity wave drag (CGWD) parameterization by Chun and Baik (1998) . This is intended to detect NCT above convective clouds. The minimum Richardson number Rimin that includes a convective GW effect, CGWD, and turbulence kinetic energy calculated using eddy viscosity from Rimin and CGWD is suggested as possible NCT diagnostics. The case study shows that this approach is feasible to predict the NCT encounters ( Trier et al. 2012 ) above the shallow convection in cold season.\nJung-Hoon Kim from the NOAA/AWC presented results of improvements to the current MWT forecasts by reducing unphysical small-scale energy in the model topography in the initialization of the NWP model ( Park et al. 2016 ). The NWP model uses high-resolution digital elevation data interpolated to the model domain, which results in unphysical energy at scales smaller than 6 times the horizontal grid spacing (i.e., 6Δx), and this needs to be properly eliminated in the model initialization. It was found that the current regional NWP model skips this procedure, which results in an adverse high false alarm ratio for MWT prediction in the western United States. After applying smoothing functions in the NWP model, the unphysical mode in the model topography was damped and has fewer spurious, trapped mountain waves, which gives better MWT forecast skill.\nBrian Pettergrew from NOAA/AWC pointed out that improvements in the lightning data allow for better decision support with newly derived products. A lightning-based echo-top product was developed based on correlations between lightning density within a 5-km grid box and the height of maximum radar echo top. This allows a 2-min update cycle, which is higher than the 5-min current radar frequency. This can give better decision support especially for rapidly developing and decaying convection.\nLOCAL WEATHER FORECASTS AND LOW-LEVEL WIND SHEAR.\nSection:\nHigh-resolution modeling techniques with data assimilation can provide detailed structures of the local wind shear near airports. And the analysis of observed signal patterns can allow better decision support for wind shear alerts and microbursts.\nYoung-Gon Lee from KMA/National Institute of Meteorological Sciences (NIMS) developed a 300-m weather prediction model that is downscaled from 17-km GDAPS to the Incheon International Airport (IIA). Data assimilation approaches using variational methods are additionally suggested by Hee-Wook Choi from KMA/NIMS to ingest observed wind data from automatic weather stations (AWSs) and the low-level wind shear alert system (LLWAS) around IIA in a cost-effective way. Better representation of model topography in a high-resolution domain with assimilated local wind data showed potential benefits to capture detailed wind forecasts and low-level wind shear (LLWS) near the airport.\nIn-Sul Song from KMA/Aviation Meteorological Office (AMO) demonstrated rule-of-thumb signals from observation data to predict local wind shear and downbursts in rapidly changing weather conditions. A 5-yr period of Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) and LLWAS data was analyzed to find better patterns for foreseeing LLWS and microbursts at IIA. Results showed that there are four distinct patterns from TDWR: horizontally sheared type, low-level jet type, cyclonic rotation, and divergent–convergent type. Ye-Ji Park from KMA/AMO examined turbulence cases issued with AMO’s local significant weather forecast (SIGWX) based on a regionally tuned KTG system and introduced their ongoing efforts for sharing more aircraft report (AIREP) data in Korea for better situational awareness and prediction.\nBrian Pettegrew from NOAA/AWC additionally discussed the challenges and potential of new approaches for LLWS guidance and wind compression using high-resolution wind forecasts and available observational data around airports, which will be beneficial for aviation operations.\nINTERACTION BETWEEN AVIATION AND CLIMATE CHANGE.\nSection:\nBetter understandings of both the impact of climate change on aviation operations and the adverse impact of aircraft emissions and contrails on climate are important to establish a long-term strategy for green aviation in the future.\nPaul D. Williams from the University of Reading emphasized that the impacts of climate change on aviation have only recently begun to emerge (e.g., Williams and Joshi 2013 ). Here, the influence of climate change on flight routes and journey times is investigated ( Williams 2016 ), which showed that a strengthening of the prevailing winds in future climate change scenarios causes eastbound flights to shorten and westbound flights to lengthen. From a conceptual model for journey times, the eastbound shortening does not cancel out the westbound lengthening, causing an increase of the total round-trip flight time. Even assuming no future growth in aviation, this results in 2,000 h of extra journey time per year for all transatlantic flights, with an extra 7.2 million gallons of jet fuel burnt and an extra emission of 70 million kilograms of carbon dioxide.\nUlrich Schumann from the German Aerospace Center (DLR) explained how contrails from aircraft can contribute to the global warming effect. Contrails are visible aircraft tracers and indicators for aviation climate impact, which are formed when water vapor is condensed and frozen on aerosols from the exhaust of aircraft engines when the ambient air temperature is below typically −40°C ( Schumann 2012 ). Contrails also form prototype cirrus, offering insight into cirrus formation, which impacts the energy budget of the atmosphere because of a net change in radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere by reflecting incoming shortwave and trapping outgoing longwave radiation. Reduction of the climate impact of contrails is technically feasible by using biofuel, optimizing aircraft design, and developing climate-optimal flight routes. Operationally, changing a flight route to avoid areas that cause warm (cold) effects of contrails could minimize the total climate impact of aviation.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe especially thank the following sponsors for making this workshop possible: Yonsei University, National Institute of Meteorological Sciences (NIMS) in Korea, Korea Meteorological Industry Promotion Agency (KMIPA), Aviation Meteorological Office (AMO), and Korean Meteorological Administration (KMA).

The system Better Place proposed had two novel prongs; first, to reduce the cost of batteries, and second, to reduce range anxiety, public infrastructure concerns, and long charging times. Yet, despite this seemingly strong combination, Better Place failed to make any progress in Denmark and Israel, the first two markets it operated in, and subsequently declared bankruptcy, selling off its collective assets for less than $500,000. Drawing from science and technology studies and the notion of “interpretive flexibility,” this paper posits several reasons to explain the failure of Better Place, including that Denmark is not as “green” as it seems nor is the Israeli market as attractive as believed, and that Better Place's solution to charging time and range anxiety resolved a psychological, not a functional, barrier of the general public to adopt electric vehicles. Before investigating these two reasons, the paper presents a short history of Better Place and explores the contours of its operations in Denmark and Israel. It then discusses why Better Place “failed” across both countries before concluding with implications for energy planning, policy, and analysis.\nItem Type:\n""","0.23499596","""http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/60664/""","[-0.087076,50.86447]"

Targeting men-who-have-sex-with-men, females who sell sex, long distance truck drivers and those who live along the countryâs transport corridors is vital for effective control of the HIV epidemic in Nigeria. Excellence and Friends Management Consult (EFMC) partnered with the Nigerian National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) to improve access to HIV, SRH services educate and test for HIV, and offer referral/treatment to HIV-infected individuals. We report on the need, process and outcome of this project.\nMethods: The Strategic Travelers Outreach Program (STOP) took place between February and August 2016 in Sagamu/Ogere and Obollo-Afor travel corridors. Through community advocacy and outreach, house-to-house, door-to-door and community/office testing, key populations were provided with targeted HIV, SRH and referral services.\nResults: Over 50,000 people were contacted with HIV and SRH education/counselling. 19,275 (M: 10,965, 56.9%; F: 8,310, 43.1%) were tested with all receiving their results same day. General positivity rate was 1.3%: female (1.9%). Brothel-based female sex workers had higher positivity rate (3.2%). The study also revealed prostitutes did not use condoms with their husbands or long-term boyfriends and that knowledge of HIV was poor.\nConclusion: The results highlight an urgent need to mobilize educational and healthcare resources to mitigate HIV transmission along these corridors. A socio-anthropological approach is required to alter long-held beliefs and change risk-seeking behavior.\nKEYWORDS\nAccess; EFMC; HIV and AIDS; Key populations; NACA; Nigeria; Sexual and reproductive health; STOP program; Travel corridors\nIntroduction\nAlthough HIV is most common among key populations (females who sell sex brothel and non-brothel based), Men-who-have-Sex-with-Men (MSM), People who Inject Drugs (PID), military and paramilitary personnel and long distance drivers; their access to reproductive and sexual health is limited [1,2]. Such limitations are also seen among women and men living with HIV as there is little programmatic guidance as to how best ensure access to sexual and reproductive health services [3]. As HIV/AIDS remains a major public health burden around the world, affecting over 36 million people and leading to the death of about 34 million people, there has been an increasing awareness and discussion of the benefits of linkage between Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH) and HIV programs at the policy, systems and service delivery levels [4,5]. Moreover, in 2010, HIV/AIDS was reported as having the 5th largest associated Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) measurement - a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death. HIV had the most prominent DALY association for people of both sexes, aged from 30-44 years in Eastern, Southern and Central Africa, the Caribbean and Thailand [6]. On that background, HIV has remained one of the most important communicable diseases in Nigeria, affecting close to 3.5 million people with about 1,476,741 requiring Anti-Retroviral Drugs (ARV) in 2013 [7].\nDespite a seeming decline in HIV prevalence, the burden of HIV disease is disproportionately high among key populations, such as females who sell sex, men-who-have-sex-with-men, people who inject drugs and long distance transport workers where rates have remained relatively high with spikes in incidence across the world [8-10]. In Nigeria, the Integrated Biological and Behavioral Surveillance Survey (IBBBS) study revealed that Men-who-have-Sex-with-Men (MSM) have the highest prevalence of 22.9%, followed by Brothel-Based Females Who Sell Sex (BBFWSS) with 19.4% prevalence, Non-Brothel-Based Females Who Sell Sex, (NBBFWSS) at 8.6% and long distance truck drivers, who had the lowest prevalence of the at-risk populations at 1.6% [11]. Some of the factors which increase the vulnerability of these groups to HIV infection and maintenance of the epidemic at the population level include risky sexual behavior, current sex-work laws and enforcement-based policies, poor perception of HIV risk, poverty, ineffective STI programming, poor integration of HIV/AIDS and sexual and reproductive health services and gender inequality [12,13].\nFurthermore, key populations have remain highly stigmatized and are unable to access appropriate health care services or exercise their rights to health due to legal restrictions, discrimination and society mediated violence [14]. For instance, in Nigeria, sex trade is an illegal trade and practitioners are criminalized; and when seen, they are arrested, required to either pay fine for their release (bail) and spend some time in prison/detention [15,16]. In the midst of the current global economic recession, it is important to track the magnitude of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, its drivers and consequences, to allocate efficiently the limited resources and to maintain funding for effective HIV/AIDS interventions and treatments [6]. In Nigeria, a particular focus for disease transmission is the âtravel corridorâ, which is a resting zone along the long distance high traffic motorways, where travelers stop for rest, refreshment and ad hoc purchases, before continuing to their final destinations. To track the epidemic, the Nigerian National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) conducted a travel corridor assessment and mapping exercise in 2013, which revealed the need for a specific travel corridor project to assess the microculture and HIV disease prevalence in these communities [17]. The goal of this project was to improve the access of key populations to reproductive and sexual health along two travel corridors in Nigeria.\nMethodology\nPre-project activities\nThe National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) in Nigeria contracted Excellence and Friends Management Consult (EFMC) to execute the Travel Corridor Prevention Initiative (TCPI) in Sagamu (Ogun State, South West Nigeria) and Obollo-Afor (Enugu State, South East Nigeria) Travel Corridors in 2016 (Figure 1). We signed a 6 monthsâ contract with NACA in Abuja, Nigeria in early 2016, developed strategies and operational guidelines and a standard operating procedure using a minimum prevention package initiative [14]. In addition, office and staff accommodation spaces were secured and equipped. Three full time staff and several volunteers were identified, shortlisted, interviewed and engaged. Banners and fliers were designed, developed, pre-tested and mass produced for the project (Figure 2). Community gatekeepers such as community, religion, market women, Brothel-Based Females Who Sell Sex (BBFWSS), Long Distance Drivers (LDD), commercial motorcycle riders, street traders, the police, Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), the National Civil Defense Corps and road traffic union leaders were identified, interviewed, their views sought and engaged.\nPermission to execute the work was sought and obtained from appropriate state, institutional and local government authorities. HIV Rapid Diagnostic Kits, information bulletins and fliers and condoms were sourced from NACA and shipped to Sagamu and Obollo-Afor. Startup meetings were held in Abuja, Sagamu and Obollo-Afor. Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials were produced and distributed.\nProject areas\nSite 1:\nSagamu: Sagamu Local Government Area in Ogun State is bordered to the north by Ikenne LGA, to the west by Obafemi Owode LGA, to the South by Lagos State and to the East by Odogbolu LGA [17]. The LGA covers a total land area of 614 km2 (237 sq). Sagamu LGA has a total population of 253,412 in the 2006 census. The major occupation of people with the local government area includes agriculture, trading and transportation. Agricultural products in Sagamu include cocoa and kola nut, with the largest kola nut collection and distribution center in Nigeria. Sagamu has major mineral deposits of limestone, housing the West African Portland cement industry (Lafarge). Along the transport corridor in Sabo, Isale-Oko, Awolowo, Kara and WAPCO are transport workers, females who sell sex, road side traders, allied workers (mechanics and electricians), etc., [17]. Apart from a teaching hospital, the other healthcare facilities are primary healthcare centers. Stigma, discrimination and criminalization of sex trade and drug use hinders access to healthcare for those most in need.\nSite 2: Obollo-Afor: Obollo-Afor is the head quarter of Udenu LGA and is situated at the regional boundary between the South-East and North-Central geopolitical zones of the country [17]. Obollo-Afor has mostly farmers and traders as inhabitants. The traders sell mostly locally made and harvested farm products such as cassava, yams, cocoyam, cashew and palm kernels. The Afor market of Obollo-Afor runs every four days and is highly patronized by people from the northern and southern regions of the country. This makes Obollo-Afor a very busy travel corridor linking northern Nigeria to the south. However, healthcare services are scarce as the only secondary care center is in another community.\nProject activities\nThis project took place between March-August 2016. A scoping visit was carried out in March 2016 and office space was identified (Figure 3). We staffed and equipped the two project offices. Our key staff from Abuja trained both new officers and volunteers on Reproductive and Sexual Health (RSH), HIV testing and counselling and community programming. The training curriculum covered relevant health issues such as safe sexual habits, defensive driving techniques and use of personal protective equipment for drivers and commercial motor cycle (Okada) riders and healthy marketing behavior and attitudes. We provided HIV Testing and Counseling (HTC), free condoms and referral for those with HIV positive results to treatment sites within the region. Also, we provided free medical examinations including blood pressure checks, blood glucose testing and doctorsâ consultations. The inaugural program was held at both locations and the project was named STOP (Strategic Travelers Outreach Project). Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) services were provided at the project office and within the communities. To reach all, house-to-house, door-to-door and shop-to-shop strategies were deployed with staff and volunteers meeting people where they lived or worked. We enlisted everybody seen along the travel corridors on work days (Monday-Saturday) who gave their consent and those that came to the project office every day. Project data were entered into MS Excel and analyzed.\nQualitative studies\nOver 100 gatekeepers including community, religious groups, market women, BBFWSS, LDDs, commercial motorcycle riders, street traders, the police, National Road Safety Commission, National Civil Defense Corps, and road traffic union leaders, representing the target population were identified and interviewed. Females who sell sex were also interviewed on their sexual habits, knowledge of HIV and AIDS and prevention practices.\nResults\nOver 50,000 people drawn from LDDs, commercial motorcycle riders, street traders, market women, military and paramilitary personnel, BBFWSS and all STOP club members were reached through the STOP project and provided with reproductive and sexual education, support and guidance. Out of this, 19,275 persons (M=10965, 56.9%; F=8310, 43.1%) people within the travel corridor were tested for HIV infection and received their results. In addition, 422 people were trained on SRH, safe driving practices, first aid management and other related topics resulting in the establishment of the STOP clubs in both travel corridors. Of 19,275 tested, 243 (1.3%) were positive for HIV. Higher positivity rate was seen among females (113, 1.8%) as compared to males (41, 0.8%). Males and Females from Sagamu had higher positively that those in Obollo-Afor (Table 1). In Sagamu travel corridor, activities took place in two separate locations-Sagamu town and Ogere. Overall positivity rate out of 9606 persons tested in this location was 1.8%. Females Who Sell Sex (FWSS) had the highest positivity rate of 7.2% with Ogere having a higher rate of 7.8% as against Sagamuâs 6.5% (Table 2). Similar reports was seen in Obollo-Afor where FWSS had the highest positivity rate, followed by military and paramilitary persons as shown in table 2. Among 220 key stakeholders tested in Obollo-Afor, 4.5% were positive for HIV. Females who sell sex also had the highest positivity rate (33.3%) as shown in table 3.\nGenerally, people aged 25-49 years-old had the highest positivity rate (2.4%). In Ogere alone, those within the age bracket 20-24 years had a higher prevalence rate of 3.9%, as against 3.8% for those 25-49 years (Table 4). A similar finding was made in Obollo-Afor where persons aged 25-29 years had the highest age specific positivity rate (Table 5).\nInterviews of FWSS revealed that they did not use condoms with their husbands or long-term boyfriends. Also, their knowledge of HIV transmission risk was poor as less than 10% had a good understanding of the real meaning of HIV, transmission channels and prevention strategies. Unstandardized interviews of some FWSS revealed that a number of them knew their status (some for over 3 years), were already on antiretroviral medications or had stopped their medications because of lack of access to antiretroviral therapy (as some moved out from their previous locations to seek acceptance in new locations). Also, a number of them were married with grown-up children, had boyfriends with whom they do not use condoms and were unwilling to share their positive HIV status with their partners, clients and boyfriends. Finally, less than 10% of all those surveyed had adequate knowledge of HIV, its origin, channels of transmission and control strategies.\nDiscussion\nThe project improved access to reproductive and sexual health for over 50,000 people who were reached with sexual health education, free condoms, HIV testing and counselling, and management of sexually transmitted diseases. Of the over 19,000 people tested in the two travel corridors, 1.3% were positive for HIV with a higher prevalence in the Sagamu travel corridor that links the South-West to the Northern part of Nigeria. The 1.3% overall prevalence was similar to the 1.3% for Enugu State reported by the National HIV&AIDS and Reproductive Health Survey, but higher than the 0.6% reported for Ogun State by the same report [18]. The individual travel corridors positivity rates of 1.8% for Sagamu/Ogere and 0.8% for Obollo-Afor showed significant reversal when compared with the state figures from the above study of 0.6% and 1.3% for Ogun and Enugu States respectively. However, as the individuals in these travel corridors represent people of the various geopolitical zones, the findings were similar to the zonal reports which indicates that prevalence in the South-West of Nigeria is higher than that of the South East (2.8 vs 1.8%) [18].\nThe FWSS had the highest prevalence of 7.8% in Ogere, 6.5% in Sagamu and 1.9% in Obollo-Afor while military and paramilitary personnel had the lowest positivity rate in Sagamu/Ogere axis but higher rates in Obollo-Afor. These finding are in line with the recent Nigerian study which showed an overall HIV prevalence among the target groups of 9.5% with the highest prevalence seen among MSM (22.9%), followed by brothel based females who sell sex (19.4%), non-brothel based females who sell sex (8.6%), people who inject drugs (3.4%), police (2.5%), transport workers (1.6%) and armed forces (1.5%) [11]. A field study by EFMC in 2012 showed a similar high prevalence among females who sell sex with some brothel based females who sell sex having positivity rate of over 50% [19].\nThe different positivity rate among the military and paramilitary groups in both regions may reflect their higher level of mobility in the Nigerian South East, compared to the South-West zone. Also, there was no identifiable pattern for the positively rates seen in the rest of the key populations. This calls for a more detailed controlled study to uncover the sociological factors responsible for the current positive rates seen in the communities. During the project, it was found that FWSS were not disclosing their status, not even to their long-term boyfriends. The non-disclosure of status by FWSS shows the dangers men face when they patronize FWSS. This risk is high as studies have shown prevalence rates of up to 50% among BBFWSS [11,19]. What is more disturbing is the fact that some male customers pay extra money to the FWSS for sex without condoms, a practice that increases the possibility of new or multiple infection(s). The high HIV positivity level seen in travelers along the Obollo-Afor corridor is another issue of concern, as recent studies show a rising prevalence in Anambra (from 8.7% in 2010 to 9.7% in 2014) and Imo (3.0% to 7.5%) States, but a slightly reducing prevalence in the other States in the South East of Nigeria, including Enugu State, which decreased from 5.1% in 2010 to 4.9% in 2014 [20,21]. If the majority of those with HIV were traveling to the region (this was not studied in this work), the region may be at the risk of rising prevalence, if nothing is done.\nMore males were found to be reactive early in life (2.7%). Prevalence among the various sex groups gradually decreased until 20-24 years and begins to rise again (Table 5 and Figure 4). Among females, the trend was different. Females aged 0-14 years had the lowest HIV rate, but the rate increases in a linear pattern over the age-groups considered up to 25-49 years and then began to decline (Figure 4). This study, therefore, observed that more males were found to be HIV-infected at younger ages, with HIV prevalence decreasing up to 25 years, then increasing after 25 years of age. With females, the HIV prevalence increased gradually increases up to 49 and by 50 years and above, began to decline. An STI screening and HTC conducted among FWSS at other locations in Enugu State in 2016 showed that HIV prevalence was highest among those aged 25-49 [21]. Beyond sexual exposure, the factors behind this trend are not immediately apparent. The reason for this trend will need further exploration and thus will require future expanded qualitative studies. Refusal to disclose HIV status, even to close sexual partners, can negatively affect the overall outcome of any control measure. Working to improve their HIV knowledge will facilitate control efforts.\nLimitations\nThis study may have suffered from self-selection bias as some who already knew their HIV status may have opted out from the exercise [22,23]. If this is the case, the positivity rate in this report may not be representative of the population studies.\nConclusion\nHIV remains a major communicable health challenge in Nigeria, especially among the key populations such as females who sell sex and long distance travelers. As there are few programs targeting the informal sectors, coupled with limited access to other reproductive and sexual health services, these hotspots will remain a major cause of concern in the control of HIV epidemic until active steps are taken to reduce infections and provide compressive care and support in a sustainable manner. Expanding the STOP project may therefore be a step in the right direction.\nRecommendations\nAccess to sexual and reproductive healthcare services should be improved upon for key populations especially those in high and strategic traffic travel corridors like Obollo-Afor and Sagamu/Ogere axis. Beyond behavioral change and STI/HCT interventions, STOP should be funded to provide anti-retroviral therapy services as this will minimize loss to follow-up. This will accelerate Nigeriaâs progress towards the 90-90-90 target by 2020 and contribute to slowing the rate of new HIV infections. There is a need to institutionalize travel corridor projects in all key travel corridors in Nigeria by ensuring it is reflected in the forthcoming Nigerian National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan. The Nigerian government and development partners should mobilize resources to stop HIV transmission in these marginalized key communities through community targeted projects. Finally, there is the need to utilize socio-anthropological approaches to change the behavior of people in Nigeria towards HIV prevention in Nigeria.\nReferences\n""","0.23218915","""http://www.heraldopenaccess.us/fulltext/AIDS-Clinical-Research-&-STDs/Improving-Access-to-HIV-and-Sexual-Reproductive-Health-Services-for-Key-Populations-along-Nigerias-Transport-Corridors-The-STOP-Project.php""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

While use of spatial methods to estimate exposure to air pollution has increased the power to detect effects, questions have been raised about potential for confounding by social factors.\nMethods\nA study of singleton births in Eastern Massachusetts was conducted between 1996 and 2002 to examine the association between indicators of traffic, land use, individual and area-based socioeconomic measures (SEM), and birth outcomes (birth weight, small for gestational age and preterm births), in a two-level hierarchical model.\nResults\nWe found effects of both individual (education, race, prenatal care index) and area-based (median household income) SEM with all birth outcomes. The associations for traffic and land use variables were mainly seen with birth weight, with an exception for an effect of cumulative traffic density on small for gestational age. Race/ethnicity of mother was an important predictor of birth outcomes and a strong confounder for both area-based SEM and indices of physical environment. The effects of traffic and land use differed by level of education and median household income.\nConclusion\nOverall, the findings of the study suggested greater likelihood of reduced birth weight and preterm birth s among the more socially disadvantaged, and a greater risk of reduced birth weight associated with traffic exposures. Results revealed the importance of controlling simultaneously for SEM and environmental exposures as the way to better understand determinants of health.\nIntroduction\nAdverse birth outcomes such as low birth weight and its determinants, preterm births and intrauterine growth retardation have been associated with indicators of socioeconomic status and physical environment [ 1 – 3 ]. The issue stands high in the public health concerns due to the evidence that adverse health in early life can lead to later life diseases of childhood and adulthood [ 4 – 10 ].\nSocioeconomic status is a determinant of health in populations [ 11 , 12 ], and it has been linked to adverse birth outcomes [ 3 , 13 – 16 ]. It is likely that socioeconomic status is a measure of access to health care, empowerment, level of stress and violence, and likelihood of exposure to environmental factors, and among these air pollution exposure [ 17 , 18 ]. Air pollution, a component of the physical environment, has also been associated with low birth weight and preterm births [ 19 – 24 ]. While different sources of air pollution have been associated with increased risk of adverse health, it is traffic pollutants that show the greater heterogeneity in concentration within urban areas [ 25 ]. Because measures of concentrations of air pollutants at individual addresses are unfeasible in large studies of births or other outcomes, either modeled concentrations of air pollutants or measures of traffic such as traffic density or distance to roadways have been used as exposure indices [ 26 ]. One concern of this approach is that variability in socioeconomic measures (SEM) can predict distribution of indices of physical environment [ 27 – 30 ]. Hence by studying these two together one can control each for confounding by the other, also allowing for examination of interactions between factors. In addition, the use of SEM at both the individual and area-based level allows one to capture both the effect of individual level SEM as well as any additional contextual effects that exist at the area level. Most epidemiologic studies of pregnancy outcomes have examined the effects of individual or contextual level SEM or the effects of physical environment, but rarely the effects of all three simultaneously.\nThe present study was carried out to identify and explain disparities in reduced birth weight and preterm births in seven counties of Eastern Massachusetts between 1996 and 2002. We intended in this study to explain the variation in birth outcomes as a function of the individual and area-based level SEM, measures of traffic and land use as indices of physical environment, and their interaction using a two-level hierarchical model. We also sought to assess the degree of confounding of one group of factors by the other likely to be present in previous reports that have not examined these two groups of factors together.\nMethods\nStudy population\nThe study population included all singleton live births in Eastern Massachusetts for the counties of Bristol, Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk, and Worcester obtained from the Massachusetts Birth Registry for the period between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2002. The population of the seven counties covered about 83 percent of the state's population. Individual address of mother at time of birth was geocoded by a private firm by matching the address to state, city ZIPcode and TIGER street network data, and assigning to this street address latitude and longitude coordinates. The geocoding was then reassessed by us for accuracy and completeness. The study and the use of birth data was approved by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Human Subjects Committee of the Harvard School of Public Health. We restricted our study to births born between 20 and 45 weeks of gestation, with birth weight between 500 and 5500 grams. We also excluded those births that could not be correctly assigned an address (4.9 percent), resulting in the final number used for the study of 425 751.\nOutcome\nWe focused on three measures of birth outcomes: birth weight (continuous variable), small for gestational age (SGA) and preterm births (dichotomous variables). Low birth weight among term newborns (born at ≥ 37 to 45 weeks of gestation) may represent intrauterine growth retardation. We constructed a measure of intrauterine growth retardation, SGA, by calculating the lowest 10 percentile of the distribution of weight by gestational week, maternal race, and infant gender among all term births as the cutoff. We assigned 1 to those births falling below this cutoff and 0 otherwise (reference group). Preterm birth s were defined as all neonates born between 20 and <37 weeks of gestation. The reference group for preterm births was defined as all term births (born at ≥ 37 to 45 weeks).\nExposure\nWe used three indicators of physical environment for this study. We calculated two measures of traffic – cumulative traffic density and distance to primary highways, and assigned them at individual address of mother at time of birth. We also calculated the percent land used in each census tract for recreation and conservation.\nCumulative traffic density\nWe obtained a spatial dataset for roads and highways in Eastern Massachusetts in 2002 from the Massachusetts Highway Department (MHD 2002), which conducts annual traffic data collection. This dataset included average daily traffic (ADT) as an attribute.\nA grid made up of points spaced 200 meters apart was created over the study area of Eastern Massachusetts, using ArcGIS 9.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA) buffer tool. Around each grid point we created 100 meters radius circles. We intersected these circles with the MHD 2002 roads to create a combined dataset of roads within each circle. Cumulative ADT (CADT) was calculated for all road segments within 100 meters around each grid point as: CADT = Σ (ADT * road segment length), and that value was assigned to the respective grid point. Birth addresses were then assigned a weighted average of the estimates of the four grid points around it, using bilinear interpolation.\nDistance to roadways\nSpatial data on major roadways were obtained through the US Census 2000 Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing system (TIGER) [ 31 ]. Geocoded birth addresses were joined to these data by spatial location, using ArcGIS 9.1. Using the resulting database we identified the nearest primary highway with \""limited access\"" (these roads can only be accessed through ramps, have multiple lanes of traffic, and have no direct intersection with other roads) to the birth address and calculated the distance to this major road. The TIGER roads were chosen because the same database source was used for geocoding the birth addresses.\nLand use for recreation and conservation (open space)\nProtected and recreational open space was downloaded from MassGIS, Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs [ 32 ]. The subset of the open space designated for recreation, conservation, water supply, and forestry was intersected with 2000 Census tract boundaries (also downloaded from MassGIS) using ArcGIS 9.1. The percent of each census tract that was open space was then calculated and assigned to birth addresses belonging to that tract.\nSocioeconomic indicators\nIndividual variables\nWe obtained from the birth registry information on mother's race, years of education, and the Kotelchuck index of adequacy of prenatal care utilization (APNCU). Race/ethnic background of mother was categorized as: White, African-American, Asian, and Hispanic. Due to small numbers we excluded births from Native American mothers from the analyses (total of 674).\nWe categorized education as: high school or less (≤ 12 years of educational attainment); some college (13–15 years); and college or postgraduate (≥ 16 years). We categorized the APNCU, a measure based on the number and the time of start of mother's prenatal visits [ 33 ], into: inadequate (<50 percent of expected visits used); intermediate (50–79 percent); appropriate (80–109 percent); and appropriate plus (≥ 110 percent). Adequacy of prenatal care can be a predictor of accessibility of mother to health care, and inability to have appropriate prenatal care is more likely for those living in poorer neighborhoods.\nContextual variables\nWe obtained data from the United States Census Bureau of 2000 on median household income for each census tract in the study area, and assigned these to births whose address belonged to that tract. Preliminary analyses controlled for several other variables at the census tract level: percent below poverty, percent with low education, percent of ethnic background (African-American, Hispanic) and found no association or confounding by these factors, therefore not presented in this work.\nModel covariates\nMeasures of traffic were log transformed to stabilize the variance and used as such in the analyses. We controlled additionally in the models for age of mother, gestational age, amount of cigarettes smoked during pregnancy, chronic conditions of mother or conditions of pregnancy (renal disease, lung disease, hypertension, gestational diabetes or diabetes diagnosed otherwise, uterine bleeding), if the mother ever had a previous preterm birth, if the mother ever had a previous infant weighting 4000 grams or more, gender of infant, and year of birth to control for time trends.\nSmoking during pregnancy is associated with adverse births, and it has not been controlled for in many previous studies. Because smoking varies with social class in the United States [ 34 ], it may represent an important confounder. Information on smoking was self-reported by mother on birth certificate, and it reflects the number of cigarettes smoked per day during and pre-pregnancy.\nStatistical Methods\nModeling for gaussian data\nFor continuous outcomes such as birth weight, linear mixed regression models were carried out [ 35 ]. For example, let Yij be the response (birth weight) in the ith subject in census tract j, and child sexi, maternal agei, traffic at individual address of motheri, individual-level socioeconomic measures (ILSEM)i, census tract-level socioeconomic measures (TLSEM)j denote the set of covariates of interest. Then we considered models of the form\nY ij = u j + b 0 + b 1 child sex i + b 2 maternal age i + ... + b 3 Traffic i + b 4 ILSEM i + b 5 TLSEM j + ... + e ij\nHere e ij is the error term, and uj is the tract-specific random intercept and represents the variation of the rate in the groups due to unmeasured factors. This intercept is randomly generated from a normal distribution as suggested by Pickle [ 36 ], modeled with the SAS procedure MIXED (SAS Institute).\nModeling for binomial data\nBinomial data was modeled similarly to the normal data. For SGA and preterm births, Yij will be the outcome in the ith subject in the jth census tract, with the model of the form\nLogit(Pr Yij = 1|X) = u j + β 0 + β 1 child sex i + β 2 maternal age i + ... + β 3 Traffic i + β 4 ILSEM i + β 5 TLSEM j\nwhere u j is a random census tract intercept. This approach was implemented using a recent version of the SAS procedure GLIMMIX [ 37 ].\nIt was likely that the u i would exhibit spatial correlation, from either the models for Gaussian or Binomial data. We modeled this spatial correlation by assigning the latitude and longitude of the population centroid of each census tract to each observation in the group i, and fitting an exponential spatial correlation structure.\nWe examined effect modification by median household income and maternal education for the association between birth weight and traffic and land use variables. We assessed precision in the difference of effects by calculating 95 percent confidence intervals around that difference [ 38 ].\nResults\nDescriptive Analyses\nWe calculated mean birth weight and the percentages of SGA, preterm births and a comparison group by categories of socio-demographic variables (table 1 ). The comparison group was selected as all term births (≥ 37 to 45 weeks) of weight ≥ 2500 g just for the purpose of the descriptive analyses. Most of the births in our study were of White mothers (75.3 percent). Mean birth weight of newborns of African-American mother was about 230 g lower than that of White; lower mean birth weight was also seen for births from mothers of Hispanic or Asian background. Because of matching in defining SGA, the percent by ethnicity of mother among SGA births were similar to those in the comparison group. The proportions of births from non-White mothers among preterm births were greater than those of the comparison group, by a range of 1.6 to 5 percent.\nTable 1\nDescriptive statistics for birth weight, small for gestational age and preterm births by socio-demographics and mother characteristics among all singleton births born in Eastern Massachusetts between 1996 and 2002\nCategorical variables\n4.2\n1.3, 7.1\nAPNCU – adequacy of prenatal care utilization; CI – confidence interval; SD – standard deviation Models controlled additionally for race, APNCU, mother education and median household income by census tract (where necessary), mother age, gestational age, cigarette smoking during pregnancy, previous infant greater than 4000 grams, previous preterm birth, chronic or gestational conditions of mother, and year of birth.\n*The effect is for 1 SD change in distribution of log-transformed traffic exposures and 1 SD change in distribution of % open space by census tract.\n†Categories of median household income: below and above the median of the distribution of the variable\nWe also examined three way interactions between maternal education, median household income by tract, and our measures of physical environment and found no important differences (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nWe examined the effects of social and physical environment on birth outcomes in a study of singleton births in Eastern Massachusetts, North East US, between 1996 and 2002. Two key components of this study are worth mentioning. First, we used a two-level hierarchical model to estimate the variability in birth outcomes due to individual and contextual level SEM and indices of physical environment. A number of epidemiologic studies from the US and other countries have shown associations between air pollution and birth weight and preterm births, in particular with carbon monoxide and particulate matter [ 19 , 21 , 22 , 24 , 39 – 41 ]. The evidence however has not been fully corroborated possibly due to inadequate control for individual and neighborhood level socioeconomic indicators. Factors that account for socioeconomic position of the mother have also been associated with birth outcomes: racial/ethnic background, education, and area-based factors such as income and level of poverty [ 20 , 30 , 40 , 42 ]. However, only a limited number of studies have examined the influence of these factors, either alone or in combination, on the effects of air pollution on birth outcomes. Several studies from California, US, have examined air pollution effects on birth weight and preterm births controlling for individual or area-based SEM, but rarely controlled for both or examined interaction [ 2 , 21 , 24 ]. In Wilhelm and Ritz [ 26 ], individual and neighborhood-level SEM measures were adjusted simultaneously, however, using a one-level model. A recent study of the same population examined confounding and effect modification of traffic effect estimates for preterm birth by both individual and contextual SEM variables in two-level random effect models [ 43 ]. In a hierarchical multilevel model, Williams and coworkers [ 42 ] also examined relations between air pollution and SEM variables in multi-level models, although they did not focus on traffic pollution specifically.\nUsing the two-level hierarchical model, we found effects of individual and contextual level SEM for all three outcomes in the study (birth weight, SGA, and preterm births); the effects of traffic and land use variables were mainly seen with birth weight, with the exception of an effect of cumulative traffic density on SGA. We found that mothers with lower educational attainment were more likely of adverse births than mothers who had higher education. Lower birth weight was seen among African-American, Asian and Hispanic mothers when compared to births from White mothers; risk of preterm birth was greater for mothers of African-American background than for any other ethnic group. Having had less than appropriate prenatal care also increased the risk of adverse birth outcomes. None of the effects of individual SEM were affected when controlling for the contextual level SEM or indices of physical environment. Mothers from neighborhoods with lower median household income were also at greater risk of adverse birth outcomes. Measures of traffic exposure, estimated at the residential address of mother at time of birth, were associated with lower birth weight, and for cumulative traffic density with SGA, after control for both individual and area-based SEM.\nThe two-level modeling approach enabled us to control for confounding of one factor by the other: individual and contextual SEM, and physical environment. While the effect for educational attainment, race and index of adequacy of prenatal care on birth weight did not change after controlling for indicators of physical environment (traffic and land use), the coefficient for median household income was reduced by 23 percent. We also saw a reduction in the effects of traffic and land use variables on birth weight after controlling for SEM. The presence of race/ethnicity of mother in SEM model reduced the effect of median household income on birth weight by 58 percent. Including just race/ethnicity in exposure model reduced the effect on birth weight of cumulative traffic density by 62 percent, distance to major roads by 25 percent, and that of land use as open space by 47 percent. These results suggest that race/ethnicity of mother is a strong confounder in this study. Racial/ethnic inequalities do predict health disparities, and such inequalities are a representation of a history of racial discrimination, economic deprivation, and the greater likelihood of adverse exposures throughout life [ 15 , 44 ]. The control for both race/ethnicity and other measures of socioeconomic position was an important aspect of this study; an aspect that is considered as critical in studies of social inequality [ 45 ].\nThe precision of the observed relationship between air pollution and adverse birth outcomes in other studies has been largely affected by the measure of exposure assigned to each individual in the study. The majority of the studies that examined this relationship have not taken into account variation in pollution exposure within small localities, which can lead to exposure misclassification and distortion of the association. Two studies in California, US, merely averaged monitors within few miles of the residence of the child, for example [ 2 , 30 ]; a study in Europe [ 19 ] and another one in Brazil [ 40 ] used averaged county level data. As it has been indicated in previous studies, small scale variations are related also to variations in the socio-economic status [ 28 ]. We used individual traffic measures as predictors of air pollution, the second key component in our study: cumulative traffic density and distance to major highways within a radius of the subjects' home. Distance to roadways has been reported to approximate somewhat better personal exposure levels of air pollutants than ambient measurements. Studies have reported strong gradients of pollutant concentrations and particle size distribution for distances beyond 100 meters from the roads [ 46 , 47 ]. In our study we observed associations of traffic variables with reduced birth weight, suggestive evidence with SGA, but not with preterm births. In combination with the indicator of land use, our results suggested that the increased level of urbanization increases the likelihood of exposure and that of adverse births. We found an association of increased open space and space for recreation with a better outcome of birth weight. It may be suggested that this variable indicates greater distance to traffic, more green areas, and less urbanized residence, therefore contributing to less exposure.\nThe geographic differences in the distribution of air pollutants are related to the geographic distribution of wealth and socioeconomic status [ 18 , 48 , 49 ]. However, traffic can only partly explain the variability in exposures observed in diverse neighborhoods. Increased susceptibility to the effects of air pollution due to disadvantaged socioeconomic status may be related to greater likelihood for co-exposures due to poor living conditions or occupational exposures, in addition to factors like reduced access to health care, poorer nutrition, and psychological stress and violence. We examined the variability in exposure effects by categories of SEM, and found suggestive evidence that educational attainment modified the effects of indices of physical environment on birth weight, with worse outcomes among the disadvantaged. Cumulative traffic density had a greater impact on births from mothers with lower educational attainment, and the positive effects of distance to major road and land use as open space were less in the lower education group. There was an indication of a greater effect of cumulative traffic density in the lower category of median household income. Overall, we observed a signal for an interaction between measures of social and physical environment.\nThere are limitations to this study that need to be mentioned. Exposure was estimated by distance to major highways and cumulative traffic density at individual birth addresses, as an approximate measure to concentrations of air pollutants. These exposure measures were, however, not directly related to personal air pollutant concentrations of each study subject. Also, mother address at time of birth was used to assign individual exposure indices. That address was not necessarily the address of mother during pregnancy, and we had no information available to correct for this. Both these limitations do introduce misclassification, and due to the non-selective nature of this error we would expect our study estimates to be underestimated. We had self-reported information on smoking during and before pregnancy which we used in this study to control for potential confounding by smoking. Because of the imprecision of the self-reported measure of this factor, one can argue that there may be residual confounding biasing the study estimates. However, in this study we controlled for a number of SEM and since smoking is strongly correlated with social class, residual confounding by smoking is expected to be small.\nIn conclusion, the study offers a way to look at adverse health in two perspectives simultaneously: the physical and social environment. By using a broader view in trying to understand the mechanisms that determine population health, as the example in this study, one can contribute to improving epidemiologic research and hope to contribute in reducing health disparities in populations.\nAbbreviations\nTopologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Reference Systems\nDeclarations\nAcknowledgements\nSupported by the Harvard Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Center, Grants R827353 and R-832416, and National Institute for Environmental Health Science (NIEHS) ES-0002.

A consideration of the issues associated with the introduction of emission control areas\nPDF\nAbstract\nThis paper draws upon original research undertaken in the United Kingdom and Sweden. It considers the enforcement of regulations associated with the limitation of air emissions from shipping. Specifically, it considers the enforcement of regulations pertaining to the Baltic and North Sea emission control areas (ECAs). The paper outlines the steps that have been taken to ensure vessel compliance in these ECAs. It describes the effectiveness of such enforcement as well as current limitations and gives specific emphasis to the views of vessel operators. The paper ends with a series of recommendations that have been arrived at following discussion of the research findings with a select group of industry experts.\nKeywords: regulation ,  globalisation ,  ports ,  pollution ,  environment ,  emissions\nBackground\nThe latter half of the twentieth century saw increased interest amongst academics in the problem of the environment, not least how to reconcile economic, social and environmental interests (Dobson 1996 Dobson, A. 1996. “The Green Scene: Academics on the Environment.” Sociology 30 (2): 395–403. doi:10.1177/0038038596030002013. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] , 395). Within the maritime field concern with pollution, and the potential for shipping business to negatively impact on the marine environment and related biodiversity, has also grown. Marine pollution in the form of oil and chemical spills has attracted much media attention in the last 30 years as high profile incidents taking place in European waters (e.g. oil spills from the Sea Empress, Braer, Erika and Prestige) or particularly sensitive environments (e.g. Exxon Valdez) have hit the headlines. It has also attracted the attention of academics concerned to offer insight into risk mitigation and the role of regulation and of good governance in mitigating such impacts. For example, Radović et al. ( 2012 Radović, J., D. Rial, B. Lyons, C. Harman, L. Viñas, R. Beiras, J. Readman, K. Thomas, and J. Bayona. 2012. “Post-Incident Monitoring to Evaluate Environmental Damage from Shipping Incidents: Chemical and Biological Assessments.” Journal of Environmental Management 109 (Oct): 136–153. doi:10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.04.042. [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) offer an analysis of the best strategies for the detection and assessment of oil and chemical spills arising from shipping incidents in support of more effective damage limitation, whereas Xu ( 2009 Xu, J. 2009. “‘The Law and Economics of Pollution Damage Arising from Carriage of Oil by Sea.” Maritime Policy & Management 36 (4): 309–323. doi:10.1080/03088830903056942. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) offers an analysis of liability in the event of pollution damage at sea. In the face of increased public and policy concerns, the shipping industry has sought actively to curtail the negative environmental externalities arising within the shipping sector, in particular that of marine pollution. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has dedicated annex VI of the MARPOL convention to regulations concerned with the limitation of air pollution including, but not exclusively, CO2 emissions. Regulation 14 is specifically concerned with the regulation of sulphur dioxide (SOx) and particulate matter, and in 2006, 2007, and 2012, emission control areas (ECAs) restricting the emission of SOx were established in the Baltic, North Sea, and North American zones, respectively. While the pollution restrictions that were initially established by MARPOL were originally considered to be ineffective with regard to environmental impact by some commentators (Ringbom 1999 Ringbom, H. 1999. “Preventing Pollution from Ships – Reflections on the ‘Adequacy’ of Existing Rules.” Reciel 8 (1): 21–28.  [Google Scholar] ) plans to restrict sulphur levels to 0.1% by 2015 in ECAs are thought by some to represent a ‘step change’ in practice.\nThese developments have been followed with some interest in the trade and wider press and they have continued to remain central to the news agenda (see for recent examples Green 2011 Green, R. 2011. “In the Greening of Our Seas Speed Is of the Essence.” Asian Conversations. Accessed February 18. http://www.asianconversations.com/GreenShipping.php   [Google Scholar] ; Eilperin 2012 Eilperin, J.

They have also provided the focus for research in the academic community of a largely business oriented/technical nature. For example, Eide et al. have considered the cost-effectiveness of different measures which act to reduce CO2 emissions. They conclude that according to the criteria they establish, ‘several measures are cost effective’ (Eide et al. 2009 Eide, M., Ø. Endresen, R. Skjong, T. Longva, and S. Alvik. 2009. “Cost-Effectiveness Assessment of CO2 Reducing Measures in Shipping.” Maritime Policy & Management 36 (4): 367–384. doi:10.1080/03088830903057031. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 381), depending on the price of fuel, but that at the time of publication these excluded the use of solar panels, fuel cells and waste heat recovery due to the initial high investment costs associated with such technologies. In a similar vein, Longva and colleagues have considered energy efficiency design indexes (EEDI) and the establishment of associated targets (Longva, Eide, and Skjong 2010 Longva, T., M. Eide, and R. Skjong. 2010. “Determining a Required Energy Efficiency Design Index Level for New Ships Based on a Cost-Effectiveness Criterion.” Maritime Policy & Management 37 (2): 129–143. doi:10.1080/03088830903533759. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ); Notteboom ( 2011 Notteboom, T. 2011. “The Impact of Low Sulphur Fuel Requirements in Shipping on the Competitiveness of Roro Shipping in Northern Europe.” WMU Journal of Maritime Affairs 10: 63–95. doi:10.1007/s13437-010-0001-7. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ) has considered the relationship between the use of low-sulphur fuel and competitiveness in the ro-ro sector; and Schinas and Stefanakos ( 2012 Schinas, O., and C. Stefanakos. 2012. “Cost Assessment of Environmental Regulation and Options for Marine Operators.” Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies 25: 81–99. doi:10.1016/j.trc.2012.05.002. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) consider the economic and business implications of sulphur regulations.\nThis paper is written from a rather different perspective. In relation to any maritime regulatory regime, one of the concerns for ship operators is that regulations serve to create a ‘level playing field’ whereby socially responsible operators are not penalised for voluntary compliance with regulation whilst less scrupulous operators establish competitive advantage via regulatory avoidance. It is therefore essential that new regulations relating to the requirement for vessels to use expensive low sulphur fuel in specific ocean zones are effectively enforced. With its strong emphasis on the enforcement of emissions regulation, this paper therefore considers some of the issues that have arisen in conjunction with efforts to control air emissions in the North Sea and Baltic ECAs. It outlines the steps that have been taken to enforce compliance with the requirements of the ECAs and describes the limitations on the effectiveness of such enforcement. The paper further considers the responses of the industry to the introduction of ECAs and highlights the problems that some companies have had in ensuring compliance. It ends with some policy recommendations which have been arrived at following discussion of the research findings with a select group of industry experts (termed a Delphi group).\nThe regulation of deep-sea shipping\nIn the twentieth century, the international shipping industry became increasingly regulated such that by 2013 two main bodies—the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the International Labour Organisation (ILO)—were responsible for formulating the bulk of international regulation pertaining to shipping. Such international regulations were developed in addition to those introduced by specific nation states and regional bodies such as the European Union.\nThe same period witnessed the increased ascendance of the transnational corporation and the phenomenon that is termed globalisation. Globalising processes are described as those that free capital from the confines of national boundaries (Held et al. 1999 Held, D., A. McGrew, D. Goldblatt, and J. Perraton. 1999. Global Transformations: Politics, Economics, and Culture. Cambridge: Polity Press.  [Google Scholar] ) producing ‘footloose’ capital that is free to ‘scour the world’ for cheap sources of labour (Hirst and Thompson 1999 Hirst, P., and G. Thompson. 1999. Glabalisation in Question. 2nd ed. Cambridge: Polity Press.  [Google Scholar] ). In shipping, globalisation can be seen to have taken place with the flagging-out of national fleets to open registers (Sampson 2013 Sampson, H. 2013. International Seafarers and Transnationalism in the Twenty-First Century. Manchester: Manchester University Press.  [Google Scholar] ). As such, by 2012, 57% of the world fleet was registered with the 10 largest open registers (UNCTAD 2012 UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). 2012. Review of Maritime Transport 2012. New York: United Nations Publication. ISBN 978-92-1-112860-4, ISSN 0566-7682.  [Google Scholar] ). Such flagging-out was undertaken in pursuit of competitive advantage (Bergantino and Marlow 1997 Bergantino, A., and P. Marlow. 1997. An Econometric Analysis of the Decision to Flag Out. Cardiff: SIRC.  [Google Scholar] ) achieved as a result of freedom to recruit cheap labour from developing countries and regulatory avoidance (Alderton et al. 2004 Alderton, T., M. Bloor, E. Kahveci, T. Lane, H. Sampson, M. Thomas, N. Winchester, B. Wu, and M. Zhao. 2004. The Global Seafarer: Living and Working Conditions in a Globalised Industry. Geneva: ILO.  [Google Scholar] ).\nAs a result of globalisation, and in spite of the expansion of the regulatory scope of the IMO in particular, the enforcement of international regulations pertaining to shipping has presented considerable challenges to those seeking to retain control over the industry. As ships flagged-out, the traditional means for enforcing regulations relating to shipping, via flag states, was eroded. New open registers were seen to exercise little regulatory control over their fleets (Donaldson 2007 Donaldson, L. (2007) “Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas: Report of Lord Donaldson’s Inquiry into the Prevention of Pollution from Merchant Shipping.” House of Commons Parliamentary Papers Online.  [Google Scholar] ) and a series of shipping disasters with a considerable financial impact on tourism and aquaculture increased political concerns about marine governance and in particular standards pertaining to international vessels. The response by the IMO was to agree mechanisms by which nation states (also termed for this purpose port states) ratifying international regulations were free to enforce related standards in relation to all vessels calling at their ports rather than simply their own fleet of registered vessels. Port state control, as this was termed, came into its own in the latter part of the twentieth century as regional groups of port states began to collaborate with regard to inspection and the targeting of vessels for inspection. For example, the Paris Memorandum of Understanding was established amongst 14 participating states in 1982. It has subsequently grown to include 27 states and has been regarded as particularly effective in establishing higher standards for shipping and something akin to a ‘culture of compliance’ amongst operators whose vessels visit European ports (Bloor et al. 2013c). The website for the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on port state control describes the purpose of port state control as follows:\nPort state control is a check on visiting foreign ships to see that they comply with international rules on safety, pollution prevention and seafarers living and working conditions. It is a means of enforcing compliance where the owner and flag State have failed in their responsibility to implement or ensure compliance. The port State can require defects to be put right, and detain the ship for this purpose if necessary. It is therefore also a port State’s defence against visiting substandard shipping. http://www.parismou.org/organization/about_us/2010.12.28/Principles.htm accessed 28/05/2013\nThis broad regulatory overview provides the backdrop for the research described herein relating to the specific enforcement of pollution controls in European waters in the period 2010–2012. 1 1.  The paper does not focus on regulation of bunker suppliers per se which may be fertile ground for future investigation. This paper is concerned with the broader enforcement of regulations pertaining to ship emissions. View all notes\nMethods\nThe research which underpins this paper was funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council. It was undertaken in the period 2010–2012. The research considered both the North Sea and Baltic ECAs and, as such, fieldwork was focussed in both Sweden and the United Kingdom. In total 50 recorded semi-structured interviews were conducted with port state inspectors, regulators, ship operators and other key industry stakeholders. These augmented the fieldnotes that were made in the course of 16 ship inspections which were observed by researchers at 7 different port state control offices in the United Kingdom and Sweden. In addition, researchers analysed the records of Falmouth bunker deliveries, results of fuel sample tests taken in Sweden and Holland, the records of a large commercial fuel testing company and the results of a company in-house survey relating to the fleet experience of fuel sampling and testing by statutory authorities.\nA slightly different interview schedule was utilised in relation to each group of interviewees (e.g. regulators vs. ship operators) and the overall responses of each group of interviewees were compared with each other augmenting the initial intra-group analysis. Recorded interviews were transcribed and coded. Initial analysis and interpretation was augmented using the established technique of analytic induction (Cressey 1953 Cressey, D. 1953. Other People’s Money: A Study in the Social Psychology of Embezzlement. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.  [Google Scholar] ; Bloor 1978 Bloor, M. 1978. “On the Analysis of Observational Data: A Discussion of the Worth and Uses of Inductive Techniques and Respondent Validation.” Sociology 12: 545–552. doi:10.1177/003803857801200307. [Crossref] , [PubMed]   [Google Scholar] ). In this system, searches are made for deviant cases that do not fit with a working ‘hypothesis’ and these are considered in relation to the need to modify and extend the conclusions in order to deepen the analysis. Thus, in this paper we report the findings to reflect the nuances in the expressed views of stakeholders. Initially the coding of transcripts was undertaken manually by Bloor. Subsequently, in re-considering the findings in relation to the issues reported here, the transcripts were re-analysed and coded with the assistance of the software programme NVIVO by Sampson. In line with standard practice amongst qualitative researchers, no attempt is made here to quantify these data as this would not be appropriate. Thus, no ‘trends’ or statistics are reported as such. The transcripts from the study have been anonymised and placed in the ESRC archive where they can be referenced for re-evaluation and confirmation.\nTowards the end of the research phase of the project, key findings were presented to a panel of experts (an electronic ‘Delphi group’) with the intention of arriving at a consensus relating to recommendations arising from the research. The Delphi group comprised one ship operator manager, one regulator, one port state control officer and one member of an environmental NGO. The recommendations which emerged as a result of this process are presented at the end of the paper and the process itself is further discussed in Bloor et al. ( 2013b Bloor, M., S. Baker, H. Sampson, and K. Dahlgren. 2013b. “Useful but No Oracle: Reflections on the Use of a Delphi Group in a Multi-Methods Policy Research Study.” Qualitative Research. doi:10.1177/1468794113504103. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ).\nThe enforcement of regulations pertaining to emission control areas\nWithin the ECAs, an initial limit on the sulphur content of fuel was set at 1.5%. This reduced to 1% in July 2010 and it is set to be reduced further (to just 0.1%) in January 2015. Further to this, since January 2010, all vessels calling at EU ports have been required to burn fuel with a sulphur content of just 0.1% whilst at anchor within port limits or at berth. Where operators prefer, sulphur abatement technology may be deployed (in the form of scrubbers) as an alternative to the purchase and consumption of the relatively highly priced low-sulphur fuel.\nThe enforcement of the regulations relating to air pollution in the ECAs has been undertaken by port state control officers. Two primary methods have been adopted: the examination of paper records such as vessel log books and bunker fuel delivery notes and the analysis of fuel samples. Fuel samples are not extensively used however and in 2010 just 149 samples were analysed in Sweden. Other EU countries (e.g. Netherlands, Germany, Denmark) analyse similarly small numbers of samples annually whilst the United Kingdom does not generally make use of fuel sample analysis in its enforcement of air-pollution regulation.\nIn addition, experiments have been conducted with the analysis of samples taken from vessel exhaust plumes using aircraft and lasers mounted at the entrance to the port of Gothenburg. Whilst the Swedish Maritime Authority has discontinued its use of aircraft-mounted laser monitoring equipment, there is some evidence that such experiments have had a deterrent effect.\nIn Sweden, an incentives programme is in place such that more favourable fairway dues 2 2.  Fairway dues are charged to defray the costs of ice-breaking and coastal lights. View all notes (and to a lesser extent port charges) are levied from vessels demonstrating constant use of low-sulphur fuel. This measure complements and encourages compliance with low-sulphur fuel regulations but it does not substitute for local enforcement.\nProblems for enforcement\nThe research highlighted several problems in relation to enforcement of the regulations. Of greatest concern is the difficulty for port state control officers in identifying fraudulent paperwork where this may exist. Bunker fuel delivery notes are generally checked in conjunction with log books in order to ascertain compliance with fuel usage in ECAs. As one port state control inspector described it, inspectors examine:\nMostly bunker delivery notes, which proves what type of bunker they are using and then you have the log book entry for the change over because normally they will burn high sulphur outside the ECA area. So when they are coming in, so like what time they change over. [Inspector]\nA second port state inspector confirmed this with his account:\nWe will be checking the bunker delivery note, it will be cross checking with oil record book, 2 entries. If the vessel is coming into the ECA area from outside, so then you would like to see the log book entries about the change over things, obviously change over time is depending on the type of the ship, type of engine and the arrangement of change over, also the capacity of the, if they are using the same bunker tank, service tank, then the capacity of the service tank and how long it will take, so there are some calculations to verify that they are burning the compliant fuel when they are inside the ECA, so that has to be demonstrated. [Inspector]\nSulphur levels on bunker delivery notes are often hand written and are frequently illegible (not least because the carbon copy deteriorates in storage), whilst log books are open to inaccuracy. An inspector explained his concerns as follows:\nI think the regulation for this bunker […] is not fully implemented in this country because I think you will find [in] foreign countries […] all this [is] closely controlled and monitored, which is not the case here. [Inspector]\nReliance on the checking of paperwork may not, as a result, be adequate in the face of deliberate contravention of regulations by unscrupulous ship operators. Furthermore, vessels which are transiting the ECAs rather than calling at ports within them may not be subject to such inspections and could escape detection.\nIn order to detect contravention of the regulations, by vessels transiting an ECA, the use of laser monitoring equipment might appear to be ideal, although thus far the intention has only been to use this technology as a screening device to identify potential candidates for fuel sampling and testing. As previously noted, experiments with airborne laser detection equipment have been discontinued. This was due to the hazards presented to aircraft in attempting to capture samples from vessel plumes. Such technical problems are compounded by the relatively high cost of such measures although the presence of ‘sniffer planes’ sends a powerful message to vessels and could act as a very useful deterrent.\nFinally in relation to the sampling of fuel, there are a couple of problems which are worth noting. The first issue relates to the time which is generally taken when samples are sent away to independent laboratories for testing. By the time that the results of the sample analysis are available to port state control officers, it is highly likely that a vessel will have sailed. Some port state control officers have access to fuel testing procedures that offer them rapid results. However, in the United Kingdom it was reported that such samples were rarely, if ever, taken. An inspector commented that:\n[…] they tell me that they get, once they reach the continent places like Germany in particular and to a lesser extent Denmark and Holland, they are having samples of their service tanks taken, and they some of them have been taken to court and they feel it is over the top, but as far as anything about what we do here none at all. [Inspector]\nThe response of ship operators to the introduction of ECAs and problems of compliance\nIncentives to avoid regulation\nA major financial incentive currently exists with regard to the avoidance of regulations pertaining to the use of low-sulphur fuel in ECAs. This results from the high price differential between low-sulphur fuel and higher-sulphur alternatives which, at time of writing (May 2013), is $23.00 per tonne. Once the 0.1% sulphur limit comes into force in ECAs in 2015, this incentive to non-compliance will be considerably increased, since (unless vessels have fitted scrubbers) they will have to operate continuously within ECAs on distillate fuel, currently costing $280 per tonne more than high-sulphur fuel.\nLogistical reasons for non-compliance\nAnother reason that companies may fail to comply with regulations is more logistical in as much as vessels with single service tanks may experience problems with fuel changeover. This is likely to be particularly the case when vessels are only intermittently trading in an ECA and where companies and chief engineers are inexperienced in making the requisite changeover. In well-established companies, procedures for fuel changeover are generally established by the company in consultation with chief engineers who are then expected to follow company procedure for changeover and demonstrate such compliance with procedure to port state control officers. Not only does this mean that ECA regulations should be effectively complied with, it also prevents the kind of engine damage that can occur if fuel changes are attempted too quickly. An operator explained:\nWe have company procedures that they must follow […] And that is part of our SMS with DOC as well, because you will get asked that on the audit. The audit they can ask me for, we have just had Isle of Man now [the flag state], and he said show me your changeover procedure and I will then go into the technical manual, show our actual PDF on this of what we would do, and he will say show me your chief doing it, and I will have to go back and look into the records and extract and say this vessel was going into Long Beach you can see what the chief did. [Employer]\nBut not all vessels follow an invariant changeover procedure and in the course of an observed PSCO inspection, a chief engineer remarked that he was following a different changeover procedure from that which had been logged by his predecessor. Changeovers on single-service-tank vessels, which involve flushing through the service tank with low-sulphur fuel oil, may result in inadvertent non-compliance since only very small quantities of high-sulphur fuel need to remain in the service tank for the additional low-sulphur fuel oil (which frequently has a sulphur content of 0.98%, 0.99% or 1.00%) to be thrown ‘off-spec’.\nProblems of off-spec fuel and bunker fuel delivery notes\nThere was some confidence expressed in the major suppliers of bunkers in as much as operators did not expect such suppliers to be found to be guilty of providing fuel that was different to the specification of the order (off-spec fuel). One such view was expressed as follows:\nIt wouldn’t be because it was off-spec when it was delivered because it is tested and guaranteed to be spec as per that note, as per that refinery, as per those people we are working with every day. [Employer]\nSuch confidence may have accumulated as a consequence of the regular practice in many major shipping firms of sending samples of the bunkers provided for analysis at their own choice of laboratory. If such analysis demonstrated that the fuel was off-spec with regard to sulphur content, operators suggested that they would immediately be in touch with their flag state administration and any other relevant authorities.\nIt is interesting to note however that despite the confidence expressed by some operators in the major suppliers of bunkers, this practice of sampling fuel had developed in the context of experience of less trustworthy suppliers. 3 3.  We note that inadvertent contamination of bunker supplies may occur due to incomplete tank cleaning processes between deliveries of parcels of fuel of different specification in terms of sulphur content. View all notes One operator told of a case when 4.5% sulphur fuel oil was bunkered (unknowingly) by one of their vessels in Denmark. He explained how:\nWe had this once last year, the vessel bunkered off the coast of Denmark and the fuel was 4.5 sulphur, how or why 4.5% MGO was even in Denmark in the first place we don’t know, it could have come from someone as a bad batch, it could have got in somewhere and they thought let’s get it out and we ended up taking it onboard the ship. And the danger I had was she burnt the fuel, the chief made a mistake in his calculations, he didn’t come to me and he was burning the fuel. I went to the vessel in Latvia and it came through and I said ‘chief whatever you do, do not burn that fuel’, he had 80 ton of it, I said ‘do not burn that fuel’, and he said ‘but I only have 25 ton left sir’. I said ‘what do you mean you have only got 25 ton left?’, and he said ‘I have been burning it’. So she had burnt 50 ton of fuel in the Baltic region, and if the Port State had gone onboard and said let me see the sample…! [Employer]\nSuch experiences had led to the alternative view that bunker suppliers could not always be trusted and that some would, as a consequence, be open to propositions from operators seeking to avoid compliance with ECA regulations via the use of fraud in the form of the provision of fraudulent bunker fuel delivery notes. One operator put it this way:\nWe deal with um, yeah we see ‘bad’ bunkering companies on a daily basis. There is no…around the world there is no trick that they haven’t tried, I mean they have a huge bible of how to cheat shipping companies for their fuel. So it’s really about the BDN [bunker fuel delivery note]—you can easily forge the BDN if that’s what you want to do. [Employer]\nThe potential for fraud was increased by what was acknowledged to be the very poor standard of bunker fuel delivery notes. 4 4.  We note that small profit margins may act as an incentive for fraud on the part of bunker suppliers although we did not establish any direct evidence of such fraud nor of the potential drivers for it within this study. View all notes As one operator put it, the standard of bunker fuel delivery notes was:\nVery poor, very, very poor. […] it depends where you are,[…] But even Europe sometimes it is very poor, it is kind of sometimes a barge turns up and he throws the line and he pumps it off and away he goes, no one really cares you know and it is very poor to be honest. I think that the standard should be a lot better really. [Employer]\nThis produced a view amongst some operators that enforcement of the ECA regulations actually had to be ‘beefed up’ and tightened rather than ‘watered down’. As one operator described:\nThere really has to be a much more elaborate system in place to ensure that there is going to be compliance. This is really what we want to opt for going forward. [Employer]\nHowever, this view was not universally held and there were concerns expressed about the establishment of greater surveillance, particularly in the form of the sampling of fuel by port state control officers.\nA different problem was brought to our attention by one ship manager whose contracts with charterers provided that it was the charterers rather than the ship managers who organised the supply of bunkers to vessels. Regardless of where the supply was sourced from, the ship manager sent samples to a single company for testing and reported that whilst they had sometimes been assured by a charterer that the fuel supplied was compliant, their tests had revealed that this was not the case. An interviewee explained:\nEverything is sampled through the [company name] but we source our bunkers from where ever the charterer will see fit to bunker which also causes us problems sometimes where the charterer will say this type of fuel is ok and acceptable we will bunker, I will then look at the sample and say ‘no, no, we can’t burn this for sulphur reasons, or I can’t burn this because it is the wrong fuel for the engine’, obviously we have to protect that as well. [Employer]\nConcerns over the fuel supply had resulted in this company taking very elaborate steps to ensure that the fuel they had delivered was compatible with all of their requirements. Given the length of time that it normally took to get sample results back from the laboratory 5 5.  The operator told us that if they were ‘desperate’ they could get test results back faster and as quickly as within a day but that this had cost implications so that standard practice was not to do this. View all notes , it seemed that their measures involved them in very careful forward planning. The following extended extract describes their procedures for testing and the time lag between the time of bunkering and the time when the fuel is cleared for use and some of the consequences of this strategy for planning and for profits:\nWe bunkered this up in Peterhead. That will go into the ship storage tank then, we will not burn that fuel. I wait then because when the barge, the barge will come on and he will give a sample of the fuel with ticket details and everything, that then is presented to us on the fuel sample. But I won’t go off that sample, I take a secondary sample then, when they are bunkering on the manifold we take it from out manifold, 10 minutes into the delivery so you know you are getting a good grade of fuel. That will then go for sampling, I will wait for the 2 sample data’s to come back to myself and I look at the first sample from the barge or the truck, and then our sample, and I will look then at the sulphur quantity, the densities, the viscosities, firstly because you want to see you haven’t been short measured, but then you are looking at all the contaminants underneath. And when I have looked then and I am satisfied with what quantities I see or contaminants then I will contact the ship as well because the email will be sent over to them with the attachment and we will say to the guys you know this fuel is acceptable to burn and you are ok to do that.[…] It is within 2 weeks normally, it is quite a long process. […]The charterer can’t be greedy and just say you need to bunker the fuel now or we are going to leave it to the last minute you put the fuel on and now you have to burn it, they can’t do that. [Employer]\nThis example is particularly interesting because it highlights the extent to which the monitoring of bunkers is already practiced by companies because of concerns relating to fuel contaminants and quality which would seem to indicate that careful monitoring of sulphur levels to guarantee compliance with sulphur-content requirements need not necessarily place an additional operational burden on vessels.\nConcerns over bunker tests by port state control\nAlthough operators were keen to have a ‘level playing field’ in relation to competition with other shipping lines, and while they believed that such a level playing field was best established with effective enforcement of sulphur regulations, they were nevertheless anxious about the idea of port state control officers sampling directly from their tanks. One employer outlined his concerns that these might not be a ‘fair’ test as follows:\nSo then we took it, it was .95 on the bunker note, it was .95 when it came out of the refinery, it might settle in the tanks, that tank might not be used for a few days that could then come into the service tank and port state control officers, again I have heard them go into the bottom of the tank, you know which if there is anything anywhere from you know previous parcels it might be towards the bottom of a tank, yeah? [Employer]\nThe interviewee is referring here to the phenomenon known as ‘stratification’ whereby blended low-sulphur fuel oil may undergo partial separation in storage, which can result in inadvertent non-compliance, when a sample is taken by port state from the vessel’s service tank. Subsequently, this operator went further in outlining his view that he did not wish to see port state control being exerted except in a highly targeted manner which would be likely to exempt his company’s vessels from scrutiny. This appeared to be part of a general view that regulation should be minimal which of course militates against the establishment of a ‘level playing field’ and is therefore in contradiction with his express wish for the establishment of such. As he put it:\nThe people who openly breach regulations should be caught and should be, you know when they are willingly trying to get around regulations, but things are in place for that and the regime that is already here is very adequate for that. I don’t think there is a need for the European commission or for member states to do more port state control than what they already do, I don’t think there is a need because the regime is, it is an intelligence led regime, like the customs. [Employer]\nWhere operators were more enthusiastic about the use of fuel sampling, they nevertheless acknowledged that what was required was a system providing very rapid results. As one explained:\nThey [currently utilised laboratories] can provide the test results after seven days and this does not work. In order to be able to hold back the vessel you need the test maybe four hours back… [Employer]\nThey were therefore relatively supportive of the test kits that were being utilised by some port state control officers (e.g. in The Netherlands). Although these tests were generally acknowledged to be less reliable than ‘send away’ laboratory tests, they were nevertheless supported by some who held the view that:\nNo, I’ve just been looking it up when I was talking to them. I don’t know what the reliability of those test kits is but I somehow doubt that it can be that bad otherwise they wouldn’t be using it. [Employer]\nFuture concerns\nShip operators were anxious about the forthcoming tightening of the sulphur regulations which were due to come into effect in the ECAs in 2015. The additional costs to shipping fuel with a sulphur content of 0.1% or less was felt likely to threaten the competiveness of the shipping industry. The price differentials were characterised as a ‘step change’ by one operator who estimated that it would result in a substantial increase in fuel costs. He suggested that:\nThe change from 1% to 0.1 is a step change, it is not a straight line, it is a step change. And what it means is you have to burn distillate marine gas oil instead of residual fuel oil. And the price premium for that is 70–80%. [Employer]\nIn relation to this price hike there were fears that the new regulation would precipitate a ‘modal shift’ in the transport of freight. This was because it was felt that the change in fuel would increase operator costs so significantly (a 20% increase was estimated by one operator) that freight hauliers would not be able to meet the extra costs. As the above employee went on to observe, such a modal shift would not only damage the shipping industry, as some companies would inevitably fail, but could carry with it negative consequences for ambient environmental quality.\nWe have some concerns mainly in relation to the 0.1% in 2015 which takes place within the emission control areas. We believe, in the big picture that will cause a modal shift, it’ll change flows of traffic, that can have the effect of putting more freight onto the roads. […] it could well be that freight hauliers choose to travel in their trucks […] to Dover and use the very short sea crossing or the tunnel in preference to using the longer sea transit. So we can see, not only in the UK but across Europe significant change to flows of traffic and that could actually have an adverse environmental effect putting more cargo on the roads as opposed to carrying it by sea—a less efficient mode of transport, overland freight as opposed to at sea. [Employer]\nFavoured regulatory checks\nAs has already been noted, not all operators were in favour of stronger enforcement of the regulations relating to air emissions in ECAs. However, those operators who were keen to make sure that competitors did not get away with avoiding the regulations in order to establish competitive advantage acknowledged that regulatory enforcement was not a simple matter.\nIn spite of the perceived difficulties inherent in an ‘auditing’ solution involving checks on bunker fuel delivery notes and samples of bunkers from service (or ‘day’) tanks, such a solution was seen as more practical than the implementation of technical solutions requiring vessels to carry on board emissions monitoring equipment that could be scrutinised by inspectors. As one interviewee explained, technical solutions seemed difficult:\nI mean if you just see it from applicability point of view, to install such a [monitoring] system on I don’t know, 40,000 vessels it just doesn’t seem feasible. So the testing I believe has to happen while you’re in port. [Employer]\nThis operator favoured an auditing solution involving paper checks and fuel samples. It was acknowledged however that testing in port did not resolve the problem of how to ensure compliance amongst vessels in transit (i.e. going through an ECA but not calling at a port in an ECA):\nOf course you would have to figure something out on how to police transiting vessels. That we don’t really know how one would handle yet but…[Employer]\nPolicy recommendations\nA variety of policy recommendations arise from this study and these are detailed fully in a report from the study which has been published on line (Bloor et al. 2013a Bloor, M., S. Baker, H. Sampson, and K. Dahlgren. 2013a. Effectiveness of International Regulation of Pollution Controls: The Case of the Governance of Ship Emissions. Cardiff: SIRC. ISBN 1-900174-44-8.  [Google Scholar] ). Three main recommendations may be regarded of particular interest here however.\nThe first is specific to inspection practice in the United Kingdom and relates to fuel testing and the piloting of ‘sample kits’ as utilised in Germany, Holland and Sweden. The pilot would provide the opportunity to establish the accuracy of different sampling/testing methods with a view to the introduction of such sampling and testing in the future within the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom (and other EU member states) will be obliged to comply by 18 June 2014 with a revised EU sulphur directive issued on 21 November 2012 which requires member states to undertake frequent fuel sampling and testing (European Union 2012 European Union. 2012. “Directive 2012/33/EU of the European Parliament and Council of 21 November 2012.” Official Journal of the European Union 30: 111–123.  [Google Scholar] ).\nThe second recommendation relates to the publication of information on the Equasis website about vessels non-compliant with the EU regulations on sulphur levels of fuel burnt in EU ports. Currently, this will only occur if the port state control officer noting the deficiency records it as a deficiency in conjunction with the vessel’s safety management system in breach of the IMO-ISM code. Such publication is seen to act as a major deterrent to non-compliance and the recommendation is thus to extend the publicity attendant to regulatory breaches.\nThe third recommendation relates to the development of the bunker fuel delivery note. It is suggested that this document should always be written in English, should record the sulphur content of fuel delivered (already an IMO requirement, but not always complied with), should record the registration number of the supplier and that it should be easy to determine if any fraudulent alterations have been made to the note.\nConclusions\nCurrently it is possible to identify a number of difficulties relating to the enforcement of emissions control regulations as they pertain to the North Sea and Baltic ECA. Such difficulties relate to problems with fuel testing, the reliability of bunker fuel delivery notes and technical problems associated with available laser ‘plume testing’ equipment. Notwithstanding these difficulties, at the current time it would appear that most companies are complying with current regulations and that at least some non-compliance may be inadvertent (produced as a result of the supply of ‘off-spec’ bunkers or associated with poor fuel changeover techniques on vessels with single service tanks). Companies expressed a desire for a level playing field to be established in relation to exhaust emissions from ships and yet some companies nevertheless resisted the idea that inspection should increase. Those companies in favour of greater inspection saw auditing solutions such as the inspection of bunker delivery notes and oil record books alongside fuel sampling as more practical than the installation of on-board emissions-monitoring equipment. In relation to the strengthening of existing enforcement, recommendations arising from the research include suggestions for improvements to the bunker delivery note, developing effective fuel sampling techniques following experimental ‘piloting’ and the ‘naming and shaming’ of companies that do not comply with EU emission regulations on the ‘Equasis’ website.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the UK’s Maritime & Coastguard Agency and Sweden’s Sjofartsverket and Transportstyrelsen for their assistance and support.

Active safety systems require precise vehicle positioning in order to assess the safety threats accurately, especially for those systems which are developed for warning/intervention in safety critical situations. When warning drivers of a local hazard (e.g. an accident site), accurate vehicle location information is important for warning the right driver groups at the right time. Global positioning system and digital maps have become major tools for vehicle positioning providing not only vehicle location information but also geometry preview of the road being used. Advances in wireless communication have made it possible for a vehicle to share its location information with other vehicles and traffic operation centres which greatly increases the opportunities to apply vehicle positioning technologies for improving road safety. This paper presents a state‐of‐the‐art review of vehicle positioning requirements for safety applications and vehicle positioning technologies. The paper also examines key issues relating to current and potential future applications of vehicle positioning technologies for improving road safety.\nArticle Metrics\n""","3.9618368","""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01441640903441531""","[-2.099122,57.165019]"

PhD thesis, University of Liverpool.\nText\nDownload (6MB)\nAbstract\nFast diminishing fossil fuel resources, deterioration in air quality and concerns for environmental protection, continuously promote the interest in the research and development of Alternative Energy Vehicles (AEVs). Traction motor drive is an integral part and common electric propulsion system in all kinds of AEVs. It plays an utmost significant role in the development of electrified transport industry. Application of Induction Motor (IM) drive is not only limited to the domestic and industrial applications but also has an ubiquitous influence in the modern electrified transport sector. IM is characterized by a simple and rugged structure, operational reliability, low maintenance, low cost, ability to operate in a hostile environment and high dynamic performance. However, IM is one of the widely accepted choices by Electric Vehicles (EVs) manufacturer. At present, Variable speed IM drive is almost replacing the traditional DC motor drive in a wide range of applications including EVs where a fast dynamic response is required. It became possible after the technological advancement and development in the field of power switching devices, digital signal processing and recently intelligent control systems have led to great improvements in the dynamic performance of traction drives. Speed Sensorless control strategies offer better system’s reliability and robustness and reduce the drive cost, size and maintenance requirements. Sensorless IM drives have been applied on medium and high speed applications successfully. However, instability at low speed and under different load disturbance conditions are still a critical problem in this research field and has not been robustly achieved. Some application such as traction drives and cranes are required to maintain the desired level of torque down to low speed levels with uncertain load torque disturbance conditions. Speed and torque control is more important particularly in motor-in-wheel traction drive train configuration EVs where vehicle wheel rim is directly connected to the motor shaft to control the speed and torque. The main purpose of this research is to improve the dynamic performance of conventional proportional-integral controller based model reference adaptive system (PI-MRAS) speed observer by using several speed profiles under different load torque disturbance conditions, which is uncertain during the whole vehicle operation apart from the vehicle own load. Since, vehicle has to face different road conditions and aerodynamic effects which continuously change the net load torque effect on the traction drive. This thesis proposes different novel methods based on the fuzzy logic control (FLC) and sliding mode control (SMC) with rotor flux MRAS. Numerous simulations and experimental tests designed with respect to the EV operation are carried out to investigate the speed estimation performance of the proposed schemes and compared with the PI-MRAS speed observer. For simulation and experimental purpose, Matlab-Simulink environment and dSPACE DS-1104 controller board are used respectively. The results presented in this thesis show great performance improvements of the proposed schemes in speed estimation & load disturbance rejection capability and provide a suitable choice of speed sensoless IM drive control for EVs with cost effectiveness.\nItem Type:\n""","0.28429827","""https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3008062/""","[-2.96826,53.408471]"

Moreover, the electric vehicle is expected to form an additional role in power systems in terms of electrical storage and load balancing. This paper considers the latter role of the electric vehicle and its impact on the steady-state stability of power systems, particularly in the context of large-scale electric vehicle integration. The paper establishes a model framework which examines four major issues: electric vehicle capacity forecasting; optimization of an object function; electric vehicle station siting and sizing; and steady-state stability. A numerical study has been included which uses projected United Kingdom 2020 power system data with results which indicate that the electric vehicle capacity forecasting model proposed in this paper is effective to describe electric vehicle charging and discharging profiles.

But simultaneously, widespread adoption of EVs would create new challenges. For example, spatiotemporal concentration of charging events in high-density residential or commercial areas would place extreme demands on the power network, causing bottlenecks and grid instability. A novel approach to the typical decentralized control methods for EV charging service providers (CSPs) is presented. First, static price signals based on anticipated demand define a set of charging offers, targeted to segments of EV users. Prices are differentiated either only by time or both by time and place and allow comparison and evaluation of both scenarios. A choice-based revenue management method is employed to optimize allocation of generated charging offers, with respect to revenue outcome for the CSP. The charging coordination techniques are demonstrated through simulation. Data come from the London Travel Demand Survey and particularly trips around Westfield, one of Europe’s largest urban shopping malls, representing out-of-home charging behavior for short intervals in a high-demand area. Findings suggest that in a first-come, first-served system, locational pricing might create opportunities both for increased revenue and for relocation of charging events to less-congested facilities. In the revenue management system, locational pricing significantly favors total revenue outcome but without discharging vulnerable areas. However, because agents with conflicting interests participate in the process (infrastructure owners, power system operators, EV drivers), opportunity exists for the CSP to adapt constraints according to the priority of its objectives.\n< >\nTransportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board\nTransportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board\nPrint ISSN: 0361-1981\n""","10.22784","""http://trrjournalonline.trb.org/doi/10.3141/2502-15""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

However, the model based on the electrochemical reactions within the batteries is highly complex and difficult to compute using conventional approaches. Radial basis function (RBF) neural networks have been widely used to model complex systems for estimation and control purpose, while the optimization of both the linear and non-linear parameters in the RBF model remains a key issue. A recently proposed meta-heuristic algorithm named Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) is free of presetting algorithm parameters and performs well in non-linear optimization. In this paper, a novel self-learning TLBO based RBF model is proposed for modelling electric vehicle batteries using RBF neural networks. The modelling approach has been applied to two battery testing data sets and compared with some other RBF based battery models, the training and validation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed method.\nDOI\n""","9.041329","""http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/a-new-selflearning-tlbo-algorithm-for-rbf-neural-modelling-of-batteries-in-electric-vehicles(b71edc6b-aa31-48f3-9712-61f2da484191).html""","[-5.934759,54.583863]"

Previous research suggests that these determinants include both observable patent metrics of travel demand and less easily measurable triggers of charging decisions (such as range appraisal or habit). Nevertheless, analyses accounting simultaneously for both aspects are lacking. Data are used from a survey administered to EV drivers participating in the Low Carbon London EV trial to explore charging decision triggers to test their predictive power of observable metrics of charging demand, while controlling for variability in travel patterns.

Here we provide objective evidence that they do, by reviewing quantitative data from a number of studies comparing their performance with that of matched normally sighted subjects on a range of everyday visuomotor tasks. Because in real life, these tasks (grasping objects, walking, driving, reading) are habitually performed with both eyes open, our focus is on their binocular skill deficits, rather than those with their amblyopic eye alone. General findings are that individuals with abnormal binocularity show impairments in critical aspects of motor control—movement speed, accuracy or both—on every one of these activities, the extent of which correlates with their loss of stereoacuity, but not the severity of their amblyopia. Impairments were especially marked when the task was time-limited or novel. Implications are that children and adults with severely reduced or absent binocularity may be accident-prone when required to respond rapidly to unexpected situations and that amblyopia management should focus more attention on evaluating and restoring stereoacuity and stereomotion processing.\n""","0.017841019","""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/09273972.2011.600423""","[-0.102322,51.52779]"

A range of factors affecting road crossing choices of 218 adults aged 17-90+ were examined in a simulation study using filmed real traffic. With increasing age, women were shown to make more unsafe crossing decisions, to leave small safety margins and to become poorer at estimating their walking speed.  However, the age effects on all of these were ameliorated by driving experience. Men differed from women in that age was not a major factor in predicting unsafe crossing decisions. Rather, reduced mobility was the key factor, leading them to make more unsafe crossings and delay longer in leaving the kerb. For men, driving experience did not predict unsafe road crossing decisions. Although male drivers were more likely to look both ways before crossing than male non-drivers, the impact of being a driver had a negative effect in terms of smaller safety margins and delay in leaving the kerb. The implications of the different predictor variables for men and women for unsafe road crossing are discussed and possible reasons for the differences explored.\nDocuments\nPublished - Jul 2010\nBibliographic note\nNOTICE: this is the author’s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Accident Analysis and Prevention.

Disaggregate road accident data for Greece for the year 2008 were used.\nMethods: Two models were developed, one for inside and one for outside urban areas. Because the dependent variable had 2 categories, killed/severely injured (KSI) and slightly injured (SI), the binary logistic regression analysis was selected. Furthermore, this research aims to estimate the probability of fatality/severe injury versus slight injury as well as to calculate the odds ratios (relative probabilities) for various road accident configurations. The Hosmer and Lemeshow statistic and other diagnostic tests were conducted in order to assess the goodness-of-fit of the model.\nResults: From the application of the models, it appears that inside urban areas 3 types of collisions (sideswipe, rear-end, with fixed object/parked car), as well as involvement of motorcycles, bicycles, buses, 2 age groups (18–30 and older than 60 years old), time of accident, and location of the accident, seem to affect accident severity. Outside urban areas, 4 types of collisions (head-on, rear-end, side, sideswipe), weather conditions, time of accident, one age group (older than 60 years old), and involvement of motorcycles and buses were found to be significant.\nConclusions: Factors affecting road accident severity only inside urban areas include young driver age, bicycles, intersections, and collision with fixed objects, whereas factors affecting severity only outside urban areas are weather conditions and head-on and side collisions, demonstrating the particular road users and traffic situations that should be focused on for road safety interventions for the 2 different types of networks (inside and outside urban areas). The methodology and the results of this research may provide a promising tool to prioritize programs and measures to improve road safety in Greece and worldwide.\n""","0.56374943","""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15389588.2012.661110""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

To coordinate the regenerative brake and friction brake, improving regeneration efficiency and guaranteeing brake performance and brake safety, development of special brake systems for electrified vehicles is needed.This paper presents a new type of electrically-controlled regenerative braking system (EABS) that has been developed for electrified passenger vehicles, which has the potential to be brought into production in China. By utilizing as much as possible mature components, integrating cooperative regeneration with ABS/TCS functions, EABS can achieve high regeneration efficiency and brake safety while providing system reliability, low development cost and development risk.

They provide an overall measure of exposure, absorption, and metabolic activation of a mixture of DNA adduct–forming compounds, integrated with repair of DNA damage of an individual ( Farmer 1994 ; Phillips and Arlt 2007 ).\nBulky adducts have been detected in DNA from pregnant women ( Godschalk et al. 2005 ; Pedersen et al. 2009 , 2012a , 2013b ; Topinka et al. 2009 ), placenta ( Karttunen et al. 2010 ; Topinka et al. 2009 ), and cord blood ( Godschalk et al. 2005 ; Hansen et al. 1993 ; Kovács et al. 2011 ; Pedersen et al. 2009 , 2013b ; Perera et al. 2011 ; Topinka et al. 2009 ). However, most of these studies are limited in size, and very little is known so far about modifiable predictors of the in utero formation and repair of these DNA adducts.\nMaternal smoking ( Godschalk and Kleinjans 2008 ; Hansen et al. 1993 ; Pedersen et al. 2009 ), exposure to traffic-related air pollution ( Pedersen et al. 2009 ), and intake of meat with a blackened surface ( Pedersen et al. 2012a ) have been associated with higher levels of bulky DNA adducts in newborns. Diet is a significant source of exposure to agents that may modulate adduct formation toward either increase or decrease. Possible sources of these adducts are PAHs and other bulky DNA adduct–forming compounds that can be produced during cooking of certain foods such as meats and fish, and they also occur commonly as environmental contaminants especially of leafy plants, cereals, and shellfish [ European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) 2008 ]. Another possible source of these adducts is related to oxidative processes ( Arif et al. 2006 ), which may be modulated by dietary antioxidants.\nWe previously reported that higher levels of bulky DNA adducts in cord blood were significantly associated with a reduction in birth weight ( Pedersen et al. 2013b ). Therefore, to be able to prevent exposures and conditions underlying the DNA adduct formation in utero and subsequent health effects in offspring, more knowledge is needed on the main sources of DNA-damaging and -modifying factors. Given that a broad range of factors may affect the levels of bulky DNA adducts in neonates, we selected various maternal, fetal, dietary, and environmental (i.e., air and water pollution) factors known or hypothesized to affect in utero adduct formation and repair. In the present study, we investigated the relationships between these potential predictors and DNA adduct levels in white blood cells from neonates to explore and identify those preventable factors, which may be of importance for the bulky DNA adduct levels. We included exposures to compounds such as trihalomethanes (THMs) drinking-water disinfection by-products, which may not all form adducts themselves, but could modify the level of phase 1 and 2 enzymes ( Allis et al. 2002 ; Richardson et al. 2007 ) and hereby interact with the metabolism of other compounds leading to a change in total adduct levels.\nMethods\nStudy population. The study was conducted as a part of the NewGeneris project that explored the impact of diet during pregnancy on child health ( Merlo et al. 2009 ). Pregnant women were enrolled in the period from 2006 through 2010 at 11 maternity units located in Heraklion, Greece; Barcelona and Sabadell, Spain; Bradford, England; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Oslo, Norway ( Pedersen et al. 2012b ).\nDetailed information on maternal characteristics and diet was obtained from questionnaires collected before or around the time of delivery ( Table 1 ). Information on birth weight, gestational age, infant sex, and mode of delivery was obtained from birth records.\nTable 1 – Study population characteristics (n = 511) and DNA adduct levels (n/108 nucleotides).\nView larger image (TIF File)\nCord blood DNA adduct measurements were available from 630 newborns born to women with singleton deliveries. From those we excluded 119 newborns for this analysis, because no information on maternal dietary habits was available or some mothers had a total energy estimate of < 500 or > 6,000 kcal/day.\nEthical approval was obtained from the ethics committee in each country. Written informed consent was obtained from all participating women.\nDietary assessment. In each country, the individual responses on the intake frequency of each food item during pregnancy were quantified as grams per day based on recipes and standard portion sizes ( Pedersen et al. 2012b ). Related food items were aggregated into 14 food groups (see Supplemental Material, Table S1). Subgroups of food items known to be sources of either higher levels of adduct-forming exposures (e.g., processed meat, meats, and leafy green vegetables), or higher levels of potential protective components (e.g., fruits rich in vitamin C, as well as their parent food groups), were evaluated separately and as a dietary score. Meat doneness was evaluated by use of photos and questions ( Pedersen et al. 2012a ).\nThe dietary score was created. For beneficial components (i.e., fruits, vegetables, and fish), women whose consumption was below the country-specific median were assigned a value of 0, and women whose consumption was at or above the median were assigned a value of 1. For components presumed to be high in adduct-forming exposures (i.e., meat, dairy products, cakes, cereals, and bread), each woman whose consumption was below the median received a value of 1, whereas each woman whose consumption was at or above the median was assigned a value of 0. Scores were added for each woman and ranged from 0 (lowest) to 7 (highest). The score was categorized as ≤ 2, low; 3–4, medium; or 5–7, high, healthy quality.\nEstimation of exposure to ambient air pollution and drinking-water disinfection by-products. Fine particulate matter (PM ≤ 2.5 μm; PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at the maternal home addresses during pregnancy were estimated with land-use regression (LUR) modeling developed in Greece, Spain, and England as part of the ESCAPE (European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects) project ( Beelen et al. 2013 ; Eeftens et al. 2012 ; Pedersen et al. 2013a ). Concentrations of PM and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in outdoor air were measured in Greece (2009–2010), Spain (2005–2006), and England (2007–2010). These air measurements were used together with geographic information system (GIS) variables on traffic characteristics, land use, population density, topography, and data from routine monitoring stations to model the exposure to ambient air pollution during the exact pregnancy periods in Spain and England. In the Greek subsample with bulky DNA adducts, there was too few routine monitoring data available to accurately back-extrapolate the LUR estimates, and the non–back-extrapolated LUR estimates were used assuming that the temporal variation between the pregnancy periods (November 2006–March 2008) and the air sampling periods (February 2009–February 2010)was minimal.\nIn Denmark, a dispersion model was used to estimate the air pollution as the sum of local air pollution from street traffic, urban background, and regional background taking into account meteorological factors using the human exposure modeling system AirGIS ( Ketzel et al. 2011 ).\nArea-level exposure to DBPs, mainly THMs, during pregnancy was estimated in Greece, Spain, and England as part of the HiWate (Health Impacts of long-term exposure to disinfection byproducts in drinking WATEr) project ( Smith et al. 2009 ; Stayner et al. 2014 ; Villanueva et al. 2011 ). Tap-water samples from representative homes were collected repeatedly during four different time points between 2007 and 2009 in Heraklion, 2004 and 2006 in Sabadell, and 2004 and 2009 in Barcelona, and analyzed for total THMs, chloroform (CHCL3), bromoform (CHBr3), bromodichloromethane (CHBrCl2), and dibromochloromethane (CHBr2Cl) by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.\nRoutine monitoring data from 2006 through 2011 were collected from Bradford, England. Average area-level (residential) exposure was modeled for each pregnancy together with trimester-specific exposure estimates (micrograms per liter) based on mother’s residence at birth and her exact pregnancy period. Information on maternal water use habits during pregnancy was combined with estimated residential water concentrations for the Greek participants to estimate maternal THM uptake integrated across all routes, including ingestion, dermal absorption, and inhalation (micrograms per day) ( Stayner et al. 2014 ). Individual uptake could not be estimated for the participants from Spain because information on water habits was missing. For the participants from England, this integrated exposure metric accounted for boiling and filtering of the drinking water and incorporated THM uptake factors from biomonitoring studies for ingestion, showering, bathing, and swimming ( Smith et al. 2009 ).\nWe were unable to estimate air and THM exposure for all participants in each area because data were missing on home addresses during pregnancy. Exposure to air pollution could not be estimated for participants from Norway because air measurements were missing. Furthermore, estimation of THM exposure in Denmark and Norway was not possible because there were no water measurements available in these study areas.\nBlood collection and bulky DNA adduct analysis (32P-postlabeling). Cord blood was collected immediately after delivery. DNA was isolated centrally and the levels of bulky DNA adducts were determined by using the 32P-postlabeling method with the nuclease P1 adduct enrichment version according to standardized protocols ( Godschalk et al. 2005 ; Karttunen et al. 2010 ; Kovács et al. 2011 ). The protocols were harmonized and adjusted in an interlaboratory comparison study among the three 32P-postlabeling investigator laboratories ( Pedersen et al. 2013b ) and included the use of external benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE)–DNA standard [111 adducts in 108 normal nucleotides (nt)]. All samples from Greece, Spain, and Norway and the Danish samples collected in 2006–2007 were analyzed at the National Institute of Environmental Health, Budapest, Hungary (61% of the samples); the Danish samples from 2009 were analyzed at the Karolinska Institute (21%); and the samples from England were analyzed at Maastricht University (18%). The individual level of DNA adducts was obtained as the average of at least two independent measurements. The detection limit of the assay was 0.1–0.3 adducts per 108 unmodified nucleotides (n/108 nt).\nStatistical analysis. Descriptive statistics and histograms indicated that bulky DNA adduct levels in cord blood were not normally distributed, so the adduct levels were logarithmic-transformed. Linear regression models were used to evaluate the associations of the predictors with the adduct levels. The regression parameters estimated from the models were back-extrapolated using the exponential function and interpreted as ratios [mean ratio (MR)] of the mean DNA adducts in each level of the categorical variables relative to the reference group, whereas regression parameters estimated for continuous variables represent the proportional differences in DNA adduct levels associated with a 1-unit increase in continuous variables. Predictor variables were used as both continuous and categorical to assess potential nonlinear relationships with DNA adducts. In the adjusted models, potential confounders selected a priori were included: country, maternal smoking (no, yes), and prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) (kilograms per meter squared).\nMain analyses were performed using the pooled data. In addition, for evaluation of air and THM exposure levels, we adjusted for season and performed country-specific analyses.\nStata S.E. version 12.1 was used for the statistical analyses (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA), and we chose an alpha level of 5% to define statistical significance.\nResults\nStudy population. The study population was composed of neonates from Denmark (38%), Spain (24%), England (16%), Greece (11%), and Norway (11%). Mothers were predominantly white, multiparous, and nonsmoking, and few children were born before 37 weeks of gestation (n = 16) or with a birth weight < 2,500 g (n = 6) ( Table 1 ).\nMaternal, fetal, and dietary factors in relation to adduct levels. All cord blood samples (n = 511) had detectable levels of bulky DNA adducts, ranging from 0.6 to 87.5 adducts/108 nt. Adduct levels were higher in neonates from southern Europe (i.e., Greece and Spain) than from northern Europe (i.e., England, Denmark, and Norway) (p < 0.001, Table 1 ). This difference between the samples from the south and north of Europe was also observed when study population was restricted to neonates of nonsmokers only [median (minimum–maximum): southern Europe: 13.0 (0.8–87.5) vs. northern Europe: 6.8 (0.6–52.7) adducts/108 nt, p < 0.001]. Higher median adduct levels were observed in neonates whose mothers were nonwhite, obese or overweight, multiparous, and exposed to secondhand smoke ( Table 1 ), and we observed a tendency for higher median adduct levels in neonates born to women who smoked compared with those of nonsmokers [10.0 (n = 81) vs. 7.6 (n = 424) adducts per 108 nucleotide, p = 0.10]. Higher DNA adduct levels were also observed in newborns delivered by cesarean section versus vaginal birth; in boys versus girls; and in newborns born in June–August versus those born in other seasons (all p < 0.05).\nFor the full population in crude comparisons, adduct levels tended to be higher in the neonates of mothers who reported no intake of dietary supplements (p = 0.10) and a preference of well-done meat (p = 0.08). Higher adduct levels were observed in newborns of mothers who had higher intake of vegetable fats and processed meat, as well as all meat, whereas lower adduct levels were found in mothers who had higher intake of dried fruits, bread, and in children of mothers drinking tea (p < 0.05, Table 1 ; see also Supplemental Material, Table S1).\nMost of the predictors identified in the crude comparisons were no longer significant after adjustment for country, maternal smoking, and BMI (see Supplemental Material, Table S2). However, country of birth, higher maternal BMI, delivery by cesarean section, male infant sex ( Table 2 ), and low maternal intake of fruits rich in vitamin C and high intake of diary products as well as low adherence to healthy diet were associated with higher DNA adduct levels in adjusted models ( Table 3 ).\nTable 2 – Maternal and fetal predictors in adjusted associations with bulky DNA adduct levels.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nExposure to air pollution and trihalomethanes in relation to adduct levels. Air pollution concentrations tended to be higher for participants from Spain than for those from Greece, England, and Denmark (see Supplemental Material, Table S3). Higher PM2.5 air pollution exposures were associated with higher adduct levels, but the association was only borderline significant ( Table 4 ). Country-specific analysis resulted in significant associations in Denmark only (see Supplemental Material, Table S4).\nTable 4 – Environmental exposure concentrations and bulky DNA adduct levels in cord blood.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nTHM concentrations in Heraklion were very low compared with those from Bradford, Sabadell, and Barcelona (see Supplemental Material, Table S3). It was not possible to estimate THM exposure in each study area because no data were available in Denmark and Norway. No significant associations were found for the pooled sample ( Table 4 ). In England, higher area-level THM exposure during the third trimester was associated with higher adduct levels (see Supplemental Material, Table S4), but the association was of borderline significance (p = 0.10). No other associations were evident in models adjusted for season in addition to those model covariates selected a priori.\nDiscussion\nWe explored potential predictors of bulky DNA adduct levels in white blood cells from cord blood in a large prospective multi-center European pregnancy study. Several potential modifiable factors, such as higher maternal BMI, high dairy product intake, low intake of healthy food and fruits rich in vitamin C, as well as delivery by cesarean section and country of birth, were associated with higher adduct levels. Heterogeneity across countries was evident for the associations with air pollution and THMs. Adjustment for country modified some associations, suggesting that multiple country-specific factors particularly for differences between southern and northern European populations, influence the adduct levels in newborns.\nIn our study population, the adduct levels tended to be higher in neonates born to women who smoked compared with those of nonsmokers, but the prevalence of smoking overall in the study was low. Although cigarette smoke is a major source of PAHs the presence of these adducts in cord blood is related not just to cigarette smoking of the mother. Statistically significant elevated levels of these or related DNA adducts in cord blood from newborns of mothers who smoked during pregnancy have been reported in some studies ( Godschalk and Kleinjans 2008 ; Hansen et al. 1993 ; Pedersen et al. 2009 ), but not in others ( Godschalk et al. 2005 ; Topinka et al. 2009 ). Significantly elevated levels of bulky DNA adducts have been detected in placentas from women who smoked compared with nonsmokers ( Hansen et al. 1993 ; Topinka et al. 2009 ). Metabolic activation capacity of white blood cells may be a limiting factor for adduct formation when a saturation level is reached, resulting in leveling off of adduct formation as exposures increase ( van Schooten et al. 1997 ). The lack of smoking-related increase in bulky DNA adduct levels might also be attributable to efficient repair in cord blood cells and to the fact that smoking is only a fraction of the total burden of potentially genotoxic substances ( Daube et al. 1997 ). Food can also be an important source of PAHs ( EFSA 2008 ). Furthermore, samples of smokers in these cord blood studies are small and limit the precision of results.\nIn our study, a statistically significant positive association was found between maternal BMI and DNA adduct levels. A previous study has evaluated this relationship, finding a similar pattern ( Pedersen et al. 2009 ). BMI has been found to modulate the bulky DNA adduct levels in adult smokers ( Godschalk et al. 2002 ). However, no statistically significant association between BMI and bulky DNA adduct levels was reported in a pooled study with 3,600 adults ( Ricceri et al. 2010 ). Maternal BMI can be an independent risk factor or be a proxy of certain dietary/metabolic factors, which could influence in utero adduct formation.\nOur finding that delivery by cesarean section was associated with higher adduct levels might be related to oxidative stress. Indeed, higher levels of total oxidant status ( Saphier et al. 2013 ) and lipid hydroperoxide ( Mutlu et al. 2011 ) have been found among newborns born by planned cesarean section. Although oxidative stress mainly leads to formation of non-bulky DNA adducts, bulky DNA adducts may also be produced ( Arif et al. 2006 ; Berquist and Wilson 2012 ; Randerath et al. 1991 ).\nA possible explanation for the fact that boys had higher levels of adducts than girls might be sex differences in metabolic enzyme activities ( Liu et al. 2013 ). Boys may also be more vulnerable to maternal oxidative stress than girls, as suggested by a twin study ( Minghetti et al. 2013 ).\nOur finding that neonates from southern Europe had, on average, higher adduct levels than northern European neonates, is in line with findings in adults ( Ricceri et al. 2010 ) and, as previously suggested, may reflect complex geographical differences in diet, food preparations and other factors such as exposure to ultraviolet light, and perhaps different genetic susceptibility toward environmental genotoxic agents.\nMaternal intake of fruits rich in vitamin C was associated with lower adduct levels in cord blood, which is in line with previous findings; inverse associations with vitamin C have been reported in adults ( Palli et al. 2000 ; Ragin et al. 2010 ), and higher intake of fruits and vegetables have been associated with lower bulky DNA adduct levels in adults ( Palli et al. 2000 ; Peluso et al. 2008 ). Lower capacity to form DNA adducts has also been found in offspring of mice with a flavonoid-rich gestational diet ( Vanhees et al. 2012 ). However, no associations were found with fruit intake ( Pedersen et al. 2012b ), and there were no associations observed between placental DNA adduct levels and vitamins A or C or β-carotene in plasma ( Daube et al. 1997 ), but these two small studies did not estimate fruits rich in vitamin C. Likewise, the inverse association between dried fruits (rich in flavonoids) and adduct levels could suggest a potential inhibition of adduct formation by these nutrients.\nWe observed higher adduct levels among newborns of mothers with high intake of processed meats, a food group that is known to contain high levels of PAHs and heterocyclic amines [ International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 2010 ]. Supportive of this, we noted that adduct levels tended to be higher in neonates of women with preference for well-done meat (p = 0.08). Although higher cord blood adduct levels in relation to intake of meat with a blackened surface have been reported in one study ( Pedersen et al. 2012b ), a lack of any association with dietary PAH was also reported in another investigation by Perera et al. (2011) . In addition to meats, dairy foods and leafy vegetables—which are potential sources of PAH exposure—have also previously been weakly associated with adduct levels ( Falcó et al. 2003 ; Kazerouni et al. 2001 ).\nWe further evaluated the adherence to healthy food using a dietary score to take into account cumulative and interactive effects of beneficial and detrimental food patterns. We found an inverse association for high adherence to healthy food, and this approach may be particularly suitable in situations in which many dietary components may affect the outcome of investigation ( Chatzi et al. 2012 ).\nThe lack of associations between maternal exposure to ambient air pollution and adduct levels in three of four countries was unexpected, because exposure to ambient air pollution has previously been associated with higher bulky DNA adduct levels in placenta ( Topinka et al. 1997 ) and neonates ( Pedersen et al. 2009 ). Significant associations were found in the Danish subsample for which the exposure assessment was based on a dispersion model. Although studies comparing dispersion and LUR models have typically found that LUR models perform at least as well as the dispersion models considered ( Dijkema et al. 2011 ; Vardoulakis et al. 2003 ), it may be that more complete information on traffic and temporal variation related to meteorological factors has contributed to a better exposure assessment than detailed land use. All the same, ambient air is a complex and dynamic mixture that varies over space and time, and not all studies have reported elevated bulky DNA adduct levels in areas with poor air quality ( Rossner et al. 2013 ). Finally, because of missing information, we were unable to estimate the exposure to air pollution for all participants, and our result is based on a subsample (n = 291 of 511), which could not include Norway.\nTHM exposure was available for a subset of the participants from Greece, Spain, and England only (n = 230 of 511), and not all of them had complete information on covariate data. We could not estimate THM exposure in Denmark and Norway. Overall, the pooled results for THMs in water show no evidence of association with adduct levels. There was a suggestion of an association with third-trimester exposure to area-level THMs in residential drinking water in England; however, this does not reach statistical significance, which may reflect small numbers in the analysis (n = 46). Findings were not consistent across countries, but this is not unexpected. THM levels in Greece were very low and contribute very little to exposure variability. It is quite possible that the study areas in England and Spain have different THM mixture profiles, and consequently different toxicity of exposures, which could explain lack of consistency between countries. In addition, only area-level THM exposure estimates were available for comparison between England and Spain. An exposure metric that takes into account individual water use would better reflect maternal THM exposure during pregnancy. However, in this study that metric was available for England only with reasonable exposure variability. There are no previous studies on THMs and bulky DNA adducts except for experimental evidence of mutagenicity ( IARC 2004 ; Richardson et al. 2007 ). Another NewGeneris study from Crete has recently reported significant associations between THMs and micronuclei frequency in maternal lymphocytes, but the associations were not evident for the newborns ( Stayner et al. 2014 ).\nPotential limitations of our study could be related to the food frequency questionnaires, which rely on estimations of portion sizes and compositions of food. We acknowledge that interindividual differences in perception of meat doneness may have complicated our evaluation of meat doneness. Our assessment of exposure to air pollutants was limited to residential exposure to the most commonly measured pollutants, which served as a proxy for traffic and other combustion related emissions of exposures to DNA adduct–forming compounds. Exposures occurring elsewhere and during other time periods were not evaluated. Moreover, air pollution exposure was available only for 56% of the total study population, which did not include all participants from each study area or any participants from Norway. However, unadjusted and adjusted results were similar, and it is unlikely that there is any systematic bias, so we do not consider missing information on covariates a major concern for our study. Other potential limitations of our study were the inability to assess the intake of important dietary variables (i.e., vitamins E, A, and C) ( Ragin et al. 2010 ). We had limited statistical power to evaluate the potential interactions with metabolic and repair genetic polymorphisms, which has been suggested to modulate the associations with air pollution ( Topinka et al. 1997 ). We investigated a broad range of a priori–selected factors, and there might be issues related to multiple comparisons, and to the correlation between different factors and the extent to which they can act as surrogate for the exposures causing the effect. We think it is unlikely that the reported associations are chance findings, but we cannot rule out this possibility.\nKey strengths of the present study relate to the harmonized protocols of the methodology, and the fact that cord blood was collected and processed using a common protocol ( Merlo et al. 2009 ) in multiple study centers. Detailed information on maternal characteristics, such as diet, was collected in a manner that allowed pooling of data from participants enrolled in five different countries ( Pedersen et al. 2012b ). Air pollution was assessed using standardized, fine-scale land use regressions ( Beelen et al. 2013 ; Eeftens et al. 2012 ) and a validated dispersion model ( Ketzel et al. 2011 ). In addition to the sample size, having participants from different countries allows the testing of hypotheses under different settings.\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that a combination of maternal, fetal, dietary, environmental, and also unknown country-specific factors influence the in utero formation of bulky DNA adducts. Several potential modifiable factors (e.g., higher maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, low maternal intake of healthy foods, and low intake of fruits rich in vitamin C) were identified as potential risk factors. The modification of these factors through public health policies might decrease further risks for the newborns later in life.\nReferences\nAllis JW, Anderson BP, Zhao G, Ross TM, Pegram RA. 2002.

The aim of this study was to evaluate methods of estimating the inhaled dose of air pollution and understand variability in the absence of a true gold standard metric. Five types of methods were identified: (1) methods using (physical) activity types, (2) methods based on energy expenditure, METs (metabolic equivalents of task), and oxygen consumption, (3) methods based on heart rate or (4) breathing rate, and (5) methods that combine heart and breathing rate. Methods were compared using a real-life data set of 122 adults who wore devices to track movement, black carbon air pollution, and physiological health markers for 3 weeks in three European cities. Different methods for estimating minute ventilation performed well in relative terms with high correlations among different methods, but in absolute terms, ignoring increased ventilation during day-to-day activities could lead to an underestimation of the daily dose by a factor of 0.08–1.78. There is no single best method, and a multitude of methods are currently being used to approximate the dose. The choice of a suitable method for determining the dose in future studies will depend on both the size and the objectives of the study.\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.est.6b05782 .\nLiterature review of minute ventilation methods, additional information as a supplement with Table 1 , full correlation and difference matrices, Bland–Altman plots for method Ve2.1, and sensitivity analyses for sex and city ( PDF )\n""","1.2677733","""http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.6b05782""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

A robust prediction and detection of driver braking intention will enable driving assistance system response to traffic situation correctly and improve the driving experience of intelligent vehicles. In this paper, two types unsupervised clustering methods are used to build a driver braking intention predictor. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms has been widely used in clustering and pattern mining in previous researches. The proposed unsupervised learning algorithms can accurately recognize the braking maneuver based on vehicle data captured with CAN bus. The braking maneuver along with other driving maneuvers such as normal driving will be clustered and the results from different algorithms which are K-means and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) will be compared. Additionally, the importance evaluation of features from raw dataset respect to driving maneuvers clustering will be proposed. The experiment data are collected from a pure electric vehicle in real world. Final results show that the proposed method can detect driver’s braking intention in a very beginning moment with a high accuracy and the most important features for driving maneuver clustering are selected.\nEvent:\n""","0.4313231","""http://papers.sae.org/2017-01-0433/""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

Thus, the observed associations and interactions may be mediated by other ambient air pollutants, which are highly spatially correlated with NO2. However, NO2 is a strong oxidant per se, with a range of well-known adverse effects ( Forastiere et al. 2006 ; Janssen-Heininger et al. 2002 ), and NO2 either alone or combined with other pollutants may contribute to the observed effects ( Forastiere et al. 2006 ).\nIn our study, we found a nonsignificant reduction of the NO2 effects among carriers of at least one NQO1 Ser187 allele. The polymorphism that was associated with the most significant p-value in our study (rs2917666) is not known to be functional but is located in the 5´ upstream region of the gene. This region contains elements essential for the expression and induction of NQO1, such as the antioxidant response element that is required for NQO1 transcription in response to oxidative stress ( Jaiswal 2000 ; Nioi and Hayes 2004 ). The three SNPs in the NQO1 gene were in relatively weak linkage disequilibrium with the highest r2 (0.53) found for the functional Pro187Ser (rs1800566) and rs2917666. Furthermore, the association between asthma and modeled NO2 was significant for the most prevalent haplotype that contained the C allele of the rs2917666, which showed a significant interaction with NO2 in the single SNP analysis. A few studies have evaluated the role of NQO1 in relation to exposure to O3 [reviewed by Yang et al. (2008) ] and have shown that the Pro187Ser (rs1800566) polymorphism was protective in response to O3 when GSTM1 was present ( Bergamaschi et al. 2001 ; Corradi et al. 2002 ; David et al. 2003 ). Susceptibility variants on oxidative stress genes GSTM1 and GSTP1 have been associated with an increased effect of air pollution and specific pollutants ( Gilliland et al. 2004 ; Lee et al. 2004 ; Li et al. 2006 ; Melén et al. 2008 ; Romieu et al. 2004 , 2006 ). In this study, we did not observe significant associations of GSTM1 or GSTP1 polymorphisms with asthma either alone or in combination with NQO1 SNPs. Lack of consistence with previous analyses could be related to the heterogeneity of effects in adults compared with children ( Salam et al. 2008 ).\nOur findings on NQO1 reinforce the role of antioxidant system in response to air pollution ( Kelly 2003 ; Romieu et al. 2008 ). An in vitro approach proposed a hierarchical model to explain the dose-dependent response to oxidant chemicals in DEP ( Xiao et al. 2003 ) that will probably extend to gaseous pollutants like NO2 ( Saxon and Diaz-Sanchez 2005 ). With low exposure, the formation of ROS activates the transcription of genes involved in antioxidant responses, such as phase II enzymes (e.g., NQO1 and GST genes). Higher exposure activates the transcription of nuclear factor-κB and activator protein-1, resulting in increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α), leading to additional generation of ROS ( Romieu et al. 2008 ; Saxon and Diaz-Sanchez 2005 ).\nThe ECRHS is a large population-based international cohort that overcomes limitations of studies done in selected populations. The main limitations of this analysis include limited statistical power to detect interactions, some exposure misclassification, and heterogeneity and potential confounding concerning environmental exposures and genetic variation.\nStatistical power to detect interactions was relatively low ( Garcia-Closas et al. 1999 ). False-positive results have been shown to be frequent in studies on genetic variation and gene–environment interactions ( Clayton and McKeigue 2001 ), and for these reason these results should be interpreted with caution. In this study we did not perform correction for multiple comparisons. However, traditional methods based on Bonferroni are overconservative because polymorphisms within a gene are not completely independent due to linkage disequilibrium. In addition, this correction may be acceptable when searching for significant associations without preestablished hypotheses, but we selected genes in this analysis on the basis of strong prior evidence.\nStrengths and limitations of the NO2 exposure assessment have been discussed previously ( Jacquemin et al. 2009 ). The individual assignment of exposure to NO2 should result in a reduction of exposure misclassification. We evaluated NO2 exposure by geocoding home addresses of ECRHS participants and assigned ambient modeled NO2 concentration derived from the APMoSPHERE map to each subject. The year of modeled NO2 (2001) was concordant with the years of the administration of the ECRHS II questionnaire (1999–2002). However, the spatial scale of the APMoSPHERE model was relatively broad (1 × 1 km), and the model did not include monitors placed close to traffic. Thus, spatial and temporal contrasts in exposure due to very local emissions and dispersion patterns, such as those occurring in street canyons are unlikely to be captured. NO2 does also capture part of that space but as a secondary gas is certainly more homogeneously distributed than, for example, ultrafine tail pipe particles. The misclassification is random in nature so, if anything, some bias toward the null may be expected. If those local peak concentrations were particularly relevant sources of exposure to oxidants, the APMoSPHERE-based results would likely underestimate true effects and interactions.\nBecause of the lack of repeated measurements during follow-up, exposure was assigned only to residences in ECRHS II. Although levels of air pollution did not remain constant during the follow-up period, the ranking in the spatial distribution of traffic-related pollutants is likely to remain similar. Exposure misclassification is thus particularly large among those who moved after ECRHS I, possibly explaining the smaller effects observed among movers ( Beelen et al. 2008 ; Gotschi et al. 2008a ).\nLevels of air pollution and prevalence of asthma varied substantially across centers in ECRHS, showing a south–north gradient ( Gotschi et al. 2008b ; Jacquemin et al. 2009 ; Sunyer et al. 2004 ). Median levels of modeled NO2 varied from 12 µg/m3 in Umeå to more than 50 µg/m3 in Barcelona and Paris ( Jacquemin et al. 2009 ). Variables correlated with center, such as pollution composition, climatic factors, and diet, determine the individual response to air pollution ( D’Amato et al. 2005 ). All results were adjusted by center, and random-effects meta-analysis suggested that NO2 estimates and interactions with the genes were not center specific, although we acknowledge the limited power to detect this heterogeneity. In addition, recent analyses of population stratification among Europeans found correspondence between genetic variation and geographic distances, although levels of genetic diversity were low ( Heath et al. 2008 ). Previous analyses in the ECRHS have shown little evidence of population stratification ( Castro-Giner et al. 2008 ). However, this was based on an insufficient set of markers.\nAn important source of NO2 exposure in the general population originates from the use of gas cookers ( D’Amato et al. 2005 ). Several studies reported the association of indoor exposures with NO2 outcomes and respiratory or allergic outcomes ( Bernstein et al. 2008 ). In our data, outdoor NO2 was not correlated with gas cooking, and adjustment for cooking with gas did not affect the observed effects of outdoor NO2 and its interaction with the NQO1 polymorphism.\nDifferences were observed by sex, with females showing an increase in risk. However, the sample sizes of specific strata are smaller than the total population, and interpretation of these results should be done with caution. Our findings, if corroborated by others, may have significant public health implications because we identified a large group of susceptible subjects defined by the genetic makeup for whom the effect of modeled NO2-related air pollution on asthma was substantial. The affected subgroup was large, with a 46% prevalence of the C/C genotype for NQO1 rs2917666. Moreover, the number of people exposed to traffic-related pollution on a regular basis is large and as a consequence the burden of asthma related to ambient air pollution may be large not only in children, as previously documented, but also in adults.\nConclusions\nFindings from this study suggest that genetic polymorphisms in the NQO1 gene are associated with susceptibility to asthma in adults among those exposed to traffic-related air pollution. This result points to the importance of antioxidant pathways in the effects of air pollution on asthma.\nReferences\nAPMoSPHERE. 2007.

We have shown previously that one activity of the SPI-2 TTSS is the assembly of a coat of F-actin in the vicinity of bacterial microcolonies. To identify proteins involved in SPI-2 dependent actin polymerization, we tested strains carrying mutations in each of several genes whose products are proposed to be secreted through the SPI-2 TTSS, for their ability to assemble F-actin around intracellular bacteria. We found that strains carrying mutations in either sseB, sseC, sseD or spiC were deficient in actin assembly. The phenotypes of the sseB-, sseC- and sseD– mutants can be attributed to their requirement for translocation of SPI-2 effectors. SpiC was investigated further in view of its proposed role as an effector. Transient expression of a myc::SpiC fusion protein in Hela cells did not induce any significant alterations to the host cell cytoskeleton, and failed to restore actin polymerization around intracellular spiC– mutant bacteria. However, the same protein did complement the mutant phenotype when expressed from a plasmid within bacteria. Furthermore, spiC was found to be required for SPI-2 mediated secretion of SseB, SseC and SseD in vitro. An antibody against SpiC detected the protein on immunoblots from total cell lysates of S. typhimurium expressing SpiC from a plasmid, but it was not detected in secreted fractions after exposure of cells to conditions that result in secretion of other SPI-2 effector proteins. Investigation of the trafficking of SCVs containing a spiC– mutant in macrophages revealed only a low level of association with the lysosomal marker cathepsin D, similar to that of wild-type bacteria. Together, these results show that SpiC is involved in the process of SPI-2 secretion and indicate that phenotypes associated with a spiC- mutant are caused by the inability of this strain to translocate effector proteins, thus calling for further investigation into the function(s) of this protein.\nReceived 18 April, 2002; revised 30 May, 2002; accepted 31 May, 2002.\nRelated content\nArticles related to the one you are viewing\nCiting Literature\nNumber of times cited: 38\n1\nMiryoung Song, Ju-Sim Kim, Lin Liu, Maroof Husain, Andrés Vázquez-Torres, Antioxidant Defense by Thioredoxin Can Occur Independently of Canonical Thiol-Disulfide Oxidoreductase Enzymatic Activity, Cell Reports, 2016, 14, 12, 2901\nCrossRef\n2\nZhao Cheng, Junlei Yin, Xilong Kang, Shizhong Geng, Maozhi Hu, Zhiming Pan, Xinan Jiao, Safety and protective efficacy of a spiC and crp deletion mutant of Salmonella gallinarum as a live attenuated vaccine for fowl typhoid, Research in Veterinary Science, 2016, 107, 50\nCrossRef\n5\nVanessa M.

Both disciplines have, however, largely ignored the contribution of women to vehicle-related offending statistics, mirroring the pattern seen in regard to mainstream offending. This paper attempts to plug the gap by considering the relative contributions of men and women to motoring conviction data and self-report offending studies. To some extent it also does this by age, where evidence for a “ladette” style of driving among young women in England and Wales is examined from the conviction data. In general, a gender gap similar to that in mainstream crime is noted, and key theoretical explanations that could account for this are assembled. Implications for improving road safety and research are then considered given this gap and emerging support for the non-homogeneity of female driving styles.\n""","0.5345307","""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10683160600822022""","[-0.472855,51.532848]"

Reduced speeds should therefore lead to casualty reduction, and automatic speed cameras were introduced in England and Wales under the Road Traffic Act 1991 to help achieve this aim. A quasi-experimental study is described that assessed die impact of several kinds of speed camera deployment strategy in England on different types of driver. Twelve surveys were carried out in five police force areas, and more than 6800 drivels participated. While all modes of camera deployment led to lower speeds, driver types who ‘manipulated’ or ‘defied’ the cameras were least responsive to and respectful of than. Conversely, those who described themselves as ‘conforming’ to speed limits or ‘deterred’ by cameras approved of them most. Background characteristics of driver types, their perceptions of camera operation and behavioural responses to cameras arc discussed. The implications for speed limit enforcement and casualty reduction are considered in light of the findings.\n""","2.924212","""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10683160008409809""","[-0.472855,51.532848]"

Data has been sourced through the application of a self-completion household questionnaire distributed over two cities in the United Kingdom (UK). A two stage cluster analysis methodology has been followed to identify market segments in a dataset of UK drivers. Five unique segments have been identified in the analysis and are characterised by their preferences for EVs, socio-economic characteristics, current car details, and psychographic profiles. These segments hold a range of different EV preference levels, from those who appear unwilling to adopt an EV to those which are clearly attracted to EVs. Moreover, the features of these segments suggest that segments might be attracted to or repelled from EVs for different reasons. These results demonstrate that a significant degree of consumer stratification is present in the emerging market for EVs, with the possible implication being that policy interventions at the segment as opposed to market, level may prove more effective due to their ability to cater for the nuances of important segments.\n""","8.813648","""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15568318.2016.1266533""","[-2.099122,57.165019]"

It is widely acknowledged that inappropriate provision and dispatch of EV charging can lead to negative impacts on power system infrastructure. This paper considers EV requirements and proposes a module which uses owner participation, through mobile phone apps and on-board diagnostics II (OBD-II), for scheduled vehicle charging. A multi-EV reference and single-EV real-time response (MRS2R) online algorithm is proposed to calculate the maximum and minimum adjustable limits of necessary capacity, which forms part of decision-making support in power system dispatch. The proposed EV dispatch module is evaluated in a case study and the influence of the mobile app, EV dispatch trending and commercial impact is explored.\nDocuments\nRights statement: 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

First, direct calculations between these variables were undertaken. Thereafter, a variant of the method of quasi-induced exposure (a ratio of culpable versus nonculpable accidents in the population) was used and referred to as the indirect method. These methods yielded fairly similar results, given that the samples used were drawn from the same population but only partly overlapping. It was found that experience had the strongest effect on accidents in the first year of driving, while age had a u-shaped association with accidents, that is, young and old drivers had more accidents, something that was more apparent when experience was held constant. These results show that, for bus drivers, experience is initially more important than age, but after two or three years, the effect is small. Thereafter, age is the more discernible variable, although it is a very weak factor in predicting crash risk.\nArticles related to the one you are viewing\nCiting Literature\nNumber of times cited: 9\n1\nMohammad Mehdi Besharati, Ali Tavakoli Kashani, Factors contributing to intercity commercial bus drivers' crash involvement risk, Archives of Environmental & Occupational Health, 2017, 0\nCrossRef\n2\nQuang Ngoc La, Dat Van Duong, Andy H.

However, models have rarely offered variables that account for the dispersion environment close to the source (e.g., street canyons, position and dimensions of buildings, road width). This study used newly available data on building heights and geometry to enhance the representation of land use and the dispersion field in LUR. Models were developed for PM10, NOX, and NO2 for 2008–2011 for London, U.K. A separate set of models using “traditional” land use and traffic indicators (e.g., distance from road, area of housing within circular buffers) were also developed and their performance was compared with “enhanced” models. Models were evaluated using leave-one-out (n – 1) (LOOCV) and grouped (n – 25%) cross-validation (GCV). LOOCV R2 values were 0.71, 0.50, 0.66 and 0.73, 0.79, 0.78 for traditional and enhanced PM10, NOX, and NO2 models, respectively. GCV R2 values were 0.71, 0.53, 0.64 and 0.68, 0.77, 0.77 for traditional and enhanced PM10, NOX, and NO2 models, respectively. Data on building volume within the area common to a 20 m road buffer within a 25 m circular buffer substantially improved the performance (R2 > 13%) of NOX and NO2 LUR models.\nInformation  on sources of data used in the study, further information on the development of variables and LUR models, and evaluation of the models.

However, current methods for analyzing and mitigating surface safety occurrences are piecemeal in their approach and limited in scope and perspective. This paper emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to surface safety and introduces a new methodology for the development of a holistic taxonomy for critical factors underlying airport surface safety occurrences. The taxonomy incorporates findings from the relevant literature, safety data, airport surveys, and interviews with subject matter experts. It benefits from the viewpoints of all the relevant aviation stakeholders (regulators, air navigation service providers, airport authorities, airlines, ground handling companies, accident investigation boards) and derives its robustness from the combination of a number of research methods. The application of the taxonomy to support the safety risk management function within the context of safety management systems is proposed. Application of the taxonomy to a multinational data set (North America, Europe, Oceania) verifies that the databases complement each other and that a holistic picture can only be achieved through their combined use. In addition, the analysis indicates that differences in the data sets are a function of the national air traffic system and airport infrastructure, underlying regulations, reporting system and safety culture, and the viewpoint of the aviation stakeholder that is represented. Finally, the holistic approach proposed in this paper is shown to be transferable to other areas of aviation safety.\n< >\nTransportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board\nTransportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board\nPrint ISSN: 0361-1981\n""","0.8857424","""http://trrjournalonline.trb.org/doi/10.3141/2300-01""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

Commissioned facilities should be relatively predictable in their operations, whereas decommissioning operations by their nature tend to be less predictable because they are a transition from one state to another, where safety systems, structures, components, and people serving safety may all change. Of course, different operations or states will have different characteristics and varying safety requirements. In this paper, we argue that by accounting for operations according to their relative tractability for their given phase in the lifecycle of a facility, a more targeted approach to managing safety is possible—one that recognises that the less tractable operation relies on human adaptation and resilience to a greater degree than the more tractable operation. From the outset, the safety of a decommissioning operation may therefore require a thorough account of the human and organisational factors that will support or impair human adaptation and resilience. High Reliability Organisation theory may provide a useful framework to consider how to engineer resilience in decommissioning and other operations of a less tractable nature.\nKeywords\nHuman factors Decommissioning Resilience engineering Teamwork \nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access\nReferences\nBaker DP, Day R, Salas E (2006) Teamwork as an essential component of high-reliability organizations.

Walking and cycling are activities that may help to achieve health\nbenefits while also contributing to wider sustainability goals, such as a reduction in carbon emissions from transport, improvements in air quality, and reduced congestion. A variety of interventions have been used to promote travel behaviour change, for example, infrastructure change and personalised travel planning. Some researchers have directed their interest towards the potential of technology and visual representation to motivate and engage individuals to increase their sustainability practices. Computer visualisation tools may be an instrument to prompt behaviour change, leading to a shift towards\nmore active modes of travel. Visualisation technology has been used for many purposes, including raising awareness of global environmental problems, scenario modelling, and the representation of walking and cycling futures. Recently, the availability of large datasets has led to the visualisation of system-usage data from cycle-hire schemes. Elsewhere, various representations of personal journey data have been evaluated in terms of their\ncapabilities to change behaviour. Currently, it is thought that the technical possibilities of visualisations exceed the knowledge of their correct application. Therefore, methods and guidelines for producing and applying visualisations are required. To our knowledge there has been no evaluation of the use of a visualisation that shows infrastructure change to promote active travel. In this study participants were asked to watch a computer visualisation of a new walking and cycling route in Glasgow. This animated visualisation included an existing segregated cycling facility and pedestrian and cyclist bridge. Eleven\nsemistructured interviews and two focus groups considered the potential utility of  visualisation in promoting a new walking and cycling facility and identified any limitations of this approach and potential improvements. The results suggested that visualisation technology has the potential to stimulate debate on in-journey accounts of active travel and the embodied experience of cycling. The built environment and psychosocial factors that culminate in road-user conflicts were discussed. The perception of non motorised modes of transport as risky was not overlooked by participants, who shared their knowledge of cycling road safety and ‘correct’ walking and cycling behaviours. Participants responded\npositively to the appearance of protection from traffic achieved by the new routes. However, many criticised the limited coverage of the visualisation and low traffic volumes. The decision to cycle is often made in the context of real-life constraints that were not replicated fully in this visualisation. Further development of visualisation technology may be needed before it can be used successfully for active travel interventions.\nKeywords: active travel, behaviour change, built environment, infrastructure,\nvisualisation\n""","0.40904477","""http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/representing-active-travel-a-formative-evaluation-of-a-computer-visualisation-tool-demonstrating-a-new-walking-and-cycling-route(6fec8a81-9d85-4609-b87a-f0e4a4476548).html""","[-3.187347,55.947691]"

Repair is likely to be partial in the first trials, extending only one or two segments below the original injury. Furthermore, treatments that are becoming available are likely to be applied to the thoracic spinal cord to minimise loss of function resulting from damage to surviving connections. These provisos have prompted research into the improvement of clinical and physiological tests designed (1) to determine the level and density of a spinal cord injury, (2) to provide reliable monitoring of recovery over one or two spinal cord segments, and (3) to provide indices of function provided by thoracic spinal root innervation, presently largely ignored in assessment of spinal cord injury. This article reviews progress of the Clinical Initiative, sponsored by the International Spinal Research Trust, to advance the clinical and physiological tests of sensory, motor and autonomic function needed to achieve these aims.\nKeywords:\nTop of page\nIntroduction\nThere is currently no medical or surgical treatment for complete traumatic spinal cord lesion. In the United Kingdom, spinal cord injury (SCI) is not recognised as a priority by the National Health Service despite the number of sufferers; SCI affects approximately 60 out of every 100 000 of the population, with 700 new cases each year. 1 , 2 The last 10–15 years have however seen basic scientific research in animals identify several procedures that offer realistic promise for the treatment of SCI (for a review, see Fawcett 3 ). Treatment leading to recovery of significant function will require a multifaceted approach. This may include manipulation of nerve growth and inhibitory factors, insertion of bridging grafts, and the deployment of cell types (eg olfactory ensheathing cells, differentiated stem cells) that facilitate the growth of neuronal axons or replace neurons. With advances already having been made in animal studies in these fields, it is anticipated that clinical trials of treatments for paralysis caused by spinal cord injury in man will start within a few years. The trials will most probably involve subjects with a mid-thoracic injury since such interventions are likely to cause only minimal further functional deterioration in the event that the treatment is unsuccessful or damages surviving connections to spinal roots. The consequence of treatment causing further damage to the spinal cord in persons with cervical injury is likely to be a serious impediment to immediate treatment of most SCI sufferers. The risk of even a minor upward shift in the clinical neurological level of a cervical lesion cannot afford to be taken since the outcome could be loss of finger, hand or arm movements (C5–T1) or even the ability to breath spontaneously (C3–C5). Although treatment applied to the thoracic spinal cord would be safer, it is likely to result in only very modest improvement in function. Regeneration of axons in rat spinal cord has progressed for only a short distance beyond the caudal boundary of a lesion. 4 , 5 If the first attempts at treatment in man result in regenerating axons reaching target neurons sited only one or two cord segments below the caudal boundary of the original lesion, the recovery of function will be limited and may represent no real increase in the quality of life. However, the experimental trials will be worthwhile as a test-bed for future treatment at a cervical level. At the cervical level, regaining function over a short distance will provide significant functional benefits. The problem facing the first trials of treatment applied to the thoracic spinal cord is that the anticipated limited recovery of function will be difficult to quantify. The physiology of sensory, motor, and autonomic systems in the trunk has been studied less than in the limbs. The present clinical neurological assessment criteria largely ignore muscles innervated by thoracic spinal cord segments. Also, they usually do not include tests of cardiac, vasomotor, and sudomotor functions. Additionally, it is likely that successful recovery of function below a lesion will not include those segments actually at the site of damage since spinal cord neurons in the grey matter at that level will most probably have been destroyed. New improved tests of function will therefore need to distinguish subtle differences in density of spinal cord lesions above and below the injury site.\nIn 2001, the International Spinal Research Trust (ISRT) commissioned a Clinical Initiative with the aim of developing a wide range of improved clinical and physiological tests for determining the boundaries and density of SCI, and for reliable monitoring of recovery over one or two spinal cord segments. The damage caused by spinal cord injury is not completed at the instant of an accident. Secondary changes may occur and even in patients with complete SCI it takes several months before the neurological impairment is stable. The ISRT Clinical Initiative is therefore undertaking both baseline and longitudinal studies of SCI sufferers to test developing clinical and physiological assessment techniques.\nThe work is being carried out by four groups – clinical, motor, sensory, and autonomic – working closely together. Whenever possible, patient volunteers are seen by all four groups. If this is not feasible, then at least a detailed clinical neurological examination is performed on all patients undergoing any physiological studies, so that the correlation between tests can be established upon completion of data collection.\nTop of page\nClinical neurological component\nAt present, the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) standards are internationally agreed standards for neurological classification of SCI. 6 The fifth revision is currently in use. 7 There is a clear need to improve the existing clinical neurological assessment of SCI patients and to develop new clinical tests for determining the level and density of spinal cord lesions. In particular, there are no tests for determining the motor level of lesions to the thoracic spinal cord. There is also a perceived need to assess the inter-rater reliability for classifying SCI using International Standards. 8 , 9\nClinical motor tests\nInter-rater reliability of clinical motor tests (manual muscle testing according to ASIA/IMSOP standards and dynamometry testing of the 20 ASIA key muscles) has been analysed in 30 patients with SCI. The results of two examiners (a senior physiotherapist and a clinical scientist) obtained on the same patient within 48 h were compared. The individual muscle testing of the 20 ASIA key muscles showed strong agreement for manual muscle testing, and strong correlation for dynamometry measurements between the two examiners. Dynamometry adds precision to standard manual muscle testing for muscle grades 3 and 4. This initial study, showing a high level of agreement between two experienced examiners, has been extended to include clinical sensory testing and is being conducted on a larger number of patients. This will establish the extent to which the degree of variability in final results is due to inter-rater differences in clinical testing.\nClinical sensory tests\nIn order to reduce the inter-rater and test–retest variability, additional photographic documentation of sensory levels on the trunk has been added to the standard clinical sensory testing. The exact levels of the last normal dermatome and the extent of any zone of partial preservation are marked bilaterally on the abdomen and back. It is anticipated that photographic images will reduce the risk that an independent clinical rater might misjudge the location and extent of a dermatome determined by a previous rater. The addition of photographic evidence will also assist in longitudinal repeatability studies.\nCutaneous electrical perceptual sensory threshold\nIn addition to the possible limitations in the assessment of SCI that are imposed by inter-rater variability, the neurological measurement and monitoring of somatosensory function according to the guidelines of the ASIA lacks resolution. 6 Attempts have been made to improve the quantitative nature of somatosensory tests using the perceptual threshold to electrical stimulation. 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 In an extensive study of spinal dermatomes between C3 and L3 in control subjects, the perceptual threshold to low-frequency (3 Hz) electrical stimulation of the skin was found not to correlate with two-point discriminative ability. 14 There was however, good correlation between results from equivalent dermatomes on the left and right sides for both measures. In a repeatability study in trunk dermatomes, the results correlated better for electrical perceptual threshold than for two-point discrimination. 15\nAs part of developing quantitative sensory tests for monitoring changes in the level and density of spinal cord lesions, we have now established normative values for perceptual threshold to cutaneous electrical stimulation in control subjects. Perceptual thresholds were measured in 18 control subjects at ASIA sensory key points for dermatomes C3–S2 bilaterally. Perceptual threshold was defined as the lowest ascending stimulus intensity (mA) at which the subject reported sensation. The results may be conveniently plotted as the mean perceptual threshold plus two standard deviations superimposed on a diagram of the vertebral column ( Figure 1 ). The plot provides a visual template for comparing results from subjects with SCI. When perceptual thresholds for a complete (T1, ASIA grade A) SCI patient are superimposed on the normal template ( Figure 1a ), the level of SCI can be established as the lowest spinal segment for which the patient's perceptual threshold is within the control group range (mean+2 standard deviation (SD)). A zone of partial preservation at T2–3 is clearly indicated by thresholds exceeding normative values plus two SDs. In an incomplete (T5, ASIA grade D) SCI patient ( Figure 1b ), thresholds are normal above the level of lesion and raised below the lesion. In addition, the test reveals asymmetry of impairment of sensory function below the lesion. In other patients, electrical perceptual threshold tests have revealed raised sensory thresholds at levels rated normal during routine clinical assessment.\nFull figure and legend (57 K )\nPerceptual threshold tests have been carried out on 26 patients. Preliminary results suggest that perceptual threshold may be more sensitive to discrete sensory changes than standard clinical examination, and that it could be useful for determining both the level of SCI and, in patients with incomplete injury, the density of SCI.\nVibration perceptual threshold\nSimilarly, vibration threshold was measured in 12 control subjects at bony prominences within ASIA dermatomes C3–S1 bilaterally and over spinous processes C7–L5. Vibration at 100 Hz frequency was applied via a hand-held probe (Bio-thesiometer, Biomedical Instrument Co., Newbury, OH, USA). Vibration threshold was recorded as the lowest ascending vibration amplitude in microns at which the subject reported sensation. The study has confirmed the simplicity and reproducibility of the vibration test in control subjects. Its usefulness in quantifying sensory impairment in spinal cord injury is currently being established. Preliminary results in 18 patients with SCI suggest that vibration threshold may be useful in assessing the level and particularly the density of SCI below injury level.\nDisability measures\nDisability measures, which assess a patient's functional independence, have been added to the clinical testing protocol. Together with the standard disability instrument, Functional Independence Measure (FIM) 16 and two new functional measures, Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) 17 and Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI), 18 , 19 are being assessed in patients with SCI during initial rehabilitation as part of two international studies.\nTop of page\nMotor component\nThe central neural control of skeletal muscle by the corticospinal tract and by reflex afferents is reasonably well documented and understood for limbs but not for trunk muscles in man. Since the first interventive treatments for SCI are likely to involve subjects with thoracic injury, the Clinical Initiative investigation of motor function has concentrated on myotomes innervated from the thoracic spinal cord. The Initiative has also had to recognise that neural control of musculature in SCI is affected by plasticity of CNS function in addition to the loss of descending inputs to motoneurones. Physiological 20 , 21 and imaging studies 22 , 23 lend support to the notion that central neural plasticity may be induced by SCI. The study of these plastic changes to the control of musculature is of importance with regard to the recovery of function following treatment. Any regeneration of descending axons to segments below a lesion will need to re-establish connection with spinal interneurones and motoneurones. However, the patterns of activity in those regenerated axons will have been altered by the plastic changes resulting from the original injury. Supraspinal and propriospinal networks controlling the target muscles of regenerating axons neurones may require the original plastic changes to be reversed to restore normal function. The assessment of motor function will therefore need to be able to recognise any change in function altered as a result of plasticity, and to monitor any reversal. In particular, any reversal may be a significant, if indirect, pointer to the re-establishment of more normal functional connectivity during recovery.\nCorticospinal innervation of limb muscles\nThere are several aspects of the corticospinal drive to muscles below the site of incomplete SCI that are altered by a lesion. Threshold and latency of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex are increased, 24 , 20 probably as a result of reduced numbers of corticospinal axons reaching the motoneurone pool. Cortical inhibition, as revealed by the reduction in voluntary EMG to low-intensity TMS, 25 has a higher threshold and an increased latency, suggesting a downregulation of cortical inhibitory circuitry. 20 The recruitment of MEPs in thenar muscles to increasing strength of TMS of the motor cortex, or with increasing voluntary effort using a fixed strength TMS, is less steep in stable incomplete cervical SCI subjects at rest than in normal subjects. 23 These altered patterns of recruitment of thenar muscles in SCI are more similar to the normal situation for muscles of the leg. Since the leg muscles have a less evident corticospinal innervation than muscles of the hand, the finding for the thenar muscles in SCI presumably reflects a reduced corticospinal innervation resulting from the lesion. In a longitudinal study of incomplete SCI, the raised TMS thresholds for MEPs at rest and during facilitation with voluntary effort, the raised threshold for cortical inhibition, and the increased latencies of MEPs and suppressed EMG (inhibition) were all found to be constant from the time of the earliest measurements following injury and for up to 3 years. 21 This contrasted with clear signs of functional recovery as measured by neurological sensory and motor scores, particularly during the 3–6 months following injury. It was postulated that the functional differences in corticospinal control revealed by TMS might be a prerequisite for natural recovery processes that progress over months following injury.\nCorticospinal innervation of erector spinae muscles\nTMS of the motor cortex and surface electromyography (EMG), both of which are noninvasive techniques, have been used to examine the corticospinal innervation of contralateral erector spinae muscles in control subjects 26 and in patients with complete mid-thoracic (T4–T7) spinal cord injury. 27 , 28. Contrary to a previous finding, 29 MEP responses could be recorded from muscles at segments below the lesion. MEPs elicited in myotomes below the level of clinically complete lesions occur presumably because individual heads of the erector spinae muscles span several segments. In comparison with control subjects, the threshold TMS required to evoke an MEP was actually lower above the lesion, presumably as a result of central plasticity. In contrast, the threshold was raised below the lesion and increased in a linear fashion rostro-caudally ( Figure 2 ), most likely reflecting the absence of direct segmental innervation requiring greater input from collateral innervation above the lesion. The crossover from lower to higher than normal threshold coincided with the level of lesion. This feature of the responses to TMS indicates that the technique may be useful for monitoring recovery. It is reasonable to anticipate that regeneration and recovery of function might be reflected in a caudal shift of the pattern of TMS threshold values.\nFull figure and legend (38 K )\nUncrossed cortical innervation of erector spinae muscles\nDuring quiet standing, when an arm is abducted there is activation of contralateral trunk muscles to maintain stability. The manoeuvre is used routinely in stroke rehabilitation physiotherapy. In man, ipsilateral proximal arm muscles and axial muscles may be accessed via uncrossed pathways from the motor cortex 30 , 31 and such routes may be more prominent after CNS injury, for example, in stroke. 32 , 33 We have studied corticospinal facilitation of contralateral back muscles (erector spinae) during arm abduction in normal subjects in anticipation that the technique may provide a tool for the assessment of motor function controlled by uncrossed corticospinal or other descending pathways. The rationale is that the various descending motor tracts are located in different parts of the spinal cord and might be affected differently by traumatic spinal cord injury. MEP responses to TMS of the motor cortex during arm abduction were facilitated in the contralateral but not the ipsilateral erector spinae muscles, and this was evident in supine as well as standing positions. 34 , 35 We argued that the drive to the contralateral erector spinae muscles is corticospinal and likely to be ipsilateral in its cortical origin. The study is now being extended to patients with incomplete thoracic spinal injury. Persistence or otherwise of contralateral facilitation during arm abduction and a comparison with the crossed corticospinal innervation of the erector spinae (see above) will allow any differential impact of the injury on these spinal cord pathways to be assessed.\nCorticospinal innervation of internal oblique muscles\nThe muscles used in swallowing have hemispheric asymmetry of representation in the motor cortex, with dominant control from one cortex. 36 Axial muscles are also known to have a greater proportion of uncrossed ipsilateral corticospinal drive than muscles of the limbs (see above). The ability to assess the function of the anterior (uncrossed) corticospinal tract in SCI would be of considerable value when establishing motor recovery. To this effect, we have investigated the relative dominance of the corticospinal drive to the left and right internal oblique muscles of the lower abdomen. 37 Using TMS to evoke MEPs in first dorsal interosseus, deltoid, and internal oblique muscles, we found ipsilateral MEPs to be over twice as prevalent and twice as large for the internal oblique compared with the shoulder and hand muscles. The ratio of ipsilateral to contralateral responses was compared for each cortex. The mean (\nSE) value of the larger of the two ratios was 1.14\n0.28 compared with 0.27\n0.04, indicating substantial dominance by one hemisphere. Latencies of the ipsilateral MEPs were 3–5 ms longer than contralateral responses. The longer latency is consistent with transmission through ipsilateral corticospinal tracts. 31 , 32 Our preliminary results indicate that one cortex can exert a dominant control over internal oblique muscles on both sides of the body, suggesting heavy involvement of uncrossed pathways.\nCorticospinal innervation of intercostal muscles\nElectromyographic responses of intercostal muscles to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have been used to evaluate patients with cervical myelopathy. 38 We have extended the technique to examine the pattern of facilitation with changing voluntary effort at six intercostal muscle levels in control subjects. 39 In nine healthy volunteers TMS was delivered using a 9-cm circular coil centred over the vertex with the induced current flowing clockwise. Surface electrodes were placed in each intercostal space on the right side of the body at approximately 2 and 4 cm from the sternal edge. Recordings were made from the first intercostal space (T6/T7) up to the mid-clavicular line (T1/T2). Subjects breathed through a tube with a slow leak connected to a pressure meter that provided feedback of expiratory effort. The size of MEPs at all recording sites became larger with increasing voluntary expiratory effort. Averaging across all subjects, a progressive facilitation was observed on increasing the voluntary effort of expiration. The amount of facilitation was proportionally greater at low levels of effort (5–10% MEE). This is similar to the pattern for hand muscles. 23 However, the pattern of facilitation of MEPs with increasing effort is less steep in hand muscles of patients with incomplete SCI. We are now examining intercostal muscles in spinal cord-injured patients to see whether the pattern of facilitation changes in the manner observed for hand muscles. Such a diagnostic feature will assist in determining the impact of cord injury on muscles with thoracic innervation. One patient with a clinically complete lesion at T5 is illustrated in Figure 3a . Unlike control subjects, there is relatively little facilitation with weak expiratory effort (5 and 10% MEE) at any level, including sites well above the lesion. This may reflect plastic reorganization of the surviving corticospinal input to the intercostals, given that the lesion will have denervated the most caudal motoneurones. It is also evident that MEPs are recorded below the clinical level of the lesion, which may indicate a zone of partial preservation. Cortically evoked inhibition of voluntary activity in hand muscles is reduced in incomplete SCI and the suppression of EMG in response to TMS has increased latency. 20 , 40 Figure 3b shows that the latency of cortical inhibition of intercostal muscle EMG is fairly constant at different levels of voluntary effort above the lesion in the spinal cord injured patient. However, below the lesion (T6/T7), the latency is markedly prolonged at weak levels of voluntary effort, a pattern that is typical of hand muscles in patients with incomplete lesions. This again suggests a zone of partial preservation of motor function that was not detected by clinical neurological assessment. These preliminary results suggest that noninvasive TMS and EMG recording from intercostal muscles may provide diagnostic measures of the level and density of thoracic SCIs.\nFull figure and legend (23 K )\nShort- and long-latency reflexes in erector spinae muscles\nThe few reports concerning spinal reflex activity of human trunk muscles identify both short- and long-latency EMG responses to tapping muscles or spinous processes. 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 The short-latency component is an oligosynaptic or monosynaptic stretch reflex. The long-latency component appears to involve a supraspinal, possibly transcortical, route. There are several factors that make it difficult to be sure of the true nature and extent of these reflex connections. One problem is that paraspinal muscles may be innervated from more than one spinal segment and muscle fibres may span several segments. This can account for EMG responses being recorded below the level of a spinal cord lesion in response to stimulation above the lesion. 46 , 28 Second, the interpretation of complex EMG responses is problematical since longer latency responses may be confused with ongoing modulation of EMG caused by an early component. In an attempt to clarify these issues, we have conducted studies into the reflex responses of paraspinal muscles in response to tapping muscle and spinous processes in normal control subjects 47 and subjects with complete SCI at a thoracic level. An electromagnetic device provided a brief mechanical stimulus to the spinal processes or adjacent muscles of the thoracic spine. Short- and long-latency reflexes were recorded in control subjects. The short-latency reflex was more readily elicited by prodding muscle than the vertebral column, and was rarely recorded more than one segment away from the site of stimulation. The long-latency component was more readily elicited by prodding the spinous processes, and could be recorded from myotomes throughout the thoraco-lumbar spinal cord, irrespective of the level of stimulation. The origin, distribution, and latency of the short-latency reflex have the characteristics of the monosynaptic stretch reflex elicited by muscle spindle afferents. The long-latency reflex is probably excited by stimulation of mechanoreceptors within the intraspinous ligaments. 48 Its distribution and long latency are compatible with a supraspinal pathway. 49 Our initial results from 11 clinically complete thoracic (T1–T12) SCI patients further support the concept of these two reflexes having separate origins and pathways. Figure 4 compares results from an SCI patient with a complete lesion at T7 (ASIA grade A) with those of a control subject. The SCI patient shows short-latency responses to both muscle and spinous process stimuli at the level of stimulation, but no long-latency reflex at any level even though the stimuli were administered above the level of lesion. Stimuli below the lesion in this patient again elicited only segmental short-latency responses. This pattern was typical of all 11 SCI patients. The reason why long-latency responses are lacking in SCI is unclear. If propriospinal neurones are involved in the pathway then disruption of axons by the lesion may be a contributing factor. Whatever the reason, mechanically evoked reflexes in paraspinal muscles appear to show promise as tools for determining the level and completeness of SCI. Importantly, the reflexes involve only noninvasive methodology.\nTop of page\nSensory component\nAs with the motor system, sensory testing in SCI is presently directed mainly at the limbs, although the thoracic dermatomes are well defined and may readily be assessed. Currently, neurological sensory testing usually involves only a limited number of modalities, such as light touch and pinprick and, occasionally, thermal threshold. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is regarded as a potentially useful tool for measuring sensory impairment in neurological conditions including SCI, 50 provided repeated measures are taken 51 and other criteria are included. 52 We have therefore employed a wide range of sensory tests and added axon-flare responses, elicited by histamine injection or heat provocation, to the gamut of QST. In addition, we have begun a sensory repeatability study designed to assess the utility of QST in SCI.\nThe axon-flare responses included in our QST investigation clearly involve both sensory and autonomic nervous system components. In a broader approach to developing tools for assessment of autonomic function, sympathetic skin responses (SSR) to a variety of stimuli have been examined in SCI patients, together with the indices of cardiac and vasomotor function.\nQuantitative sensory testing (QST)\nA total of 50 patients with complete or incomplete SCI according to the ASIA impairment scale (International Standards for Neurological classification of Spinal Cord Injury, Revised 2000) were studied. The following tests were employed:\nLight touch threshold using Semmes–Weinstein monofilaments (A Ainsworth, University College London, UK). The number of the hair detected with the lowest force determined the threshold. An abnormal value was taken as any value greater than the number 3 filament.\nVibration perception threshold measured with a biothesiometer (Biomedical Instrument Co., Newbury, OH, USA). Abnormal measures for the index finger and great toe were taken as any value greater than 10 V. 53 , 54\nThermal thresholds to cold perception (CPT), warm perception (WPT), cold pain (CP), and heat pain (HP) were measured with the Medoc Thermal Sensory Analyser (TSA-2001, Israel). An abnormal value was taken as any value greater than 2SD from control average values.\nPain experienced in the absence of overt stimulation was assessed by direct interview using a visual analogue scale (VAS) rating pain on a scale from 0 (=no pain) to 10 (=worse imaginable pain), at rest and on movement, and the McGill Pain Questionnaire. 55 , 56\nCutaneous sensory axon reflex was evaluated using laser Doppler fluxmetry (PF4 Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden) and tracing the area of the flare in response to intradermal histamine injection (0.03 ml of 1 mg/ml histamine acid phosphate – Martindale Pharmaceuticals, UK).\nIn a group of 34 patients with complete injury, QST was carried out for dermatomes at the neurological level of the lesion, that is, the most caudal segment of the spinal cord with normal sensory and motor function on both sides of the body. QST was also applied to the zone of partial preservation (ZPP), namely those dermatomes caudal to the neurological level that remain partially innervated. In a second group of 16 patients with incomplete injury, QST was again applied at the neurological level of the lesion and at a number of dermatomes below the level of injury on both sides of the body. The rationale for not extending QST above the neurological level of lesion is that our previous (unpublished) studies in the laboratory have shown no differences in sensory thresholds several dermatomes above the clinical sensory level in patients with complete SCI.\nIn complete injury above the level of lesion, no significant deviations (Mann–Whitney t-test) from normal (n=10) were found in monofilament threshold, vibration threshold or thermal threshold to warmth perception. There was, however, a significant increase in cool perception threshold ( Figure 5a ). Cold pain and heat pain thresholds were not significantly different from normal. In the zone of partial preservation, monofilament threshold and the thermal thresholds for both cool and warmth perception were all raised. In addition, some patients reported a misinterpretation of sensation (cold for warm or vice versa), or an undefined sensation rather than thermal. Thermal allodynia was also observed in eight subjects. Below the zone of partial preservation, there was a total sensory loss, as judged by the limits of tests.\nFull figure and legend (106 K )\nIn incomplete injury above the level of lesion, no deviations from normal were found in monofilament or vibration threshold. There was, however a significant difference in cool perception and warmth perception threshold ( Figure 5b ), both being raised compared with controls. Below the level of lesion, monofilament, vibration, cool, and warm perception threshold were all raised and there was misinterpretation of thermal modalities. Thermal allodynia was noticed in four subjects.\nIn all, 12 complete and four incomplete SCI patients reported spontaneous pain at and/or below the level of lesion. The mean VAS score in the complete SCI patients was 4.2 (moderate pain), and in the incomplete lesions was 2.6 (mild pain). The McGill pain questionnaire showed that the pain was related to sensory components, whereas the other categories (eg affective) were not as prominent.\nSensory repeatability study\nFive complete SCI patients have been assessed on two occasions as part of a preliminary repeatability study. The average time between injury and the first test was 37 weeks and between the first and the second assessment was 43 weeks. Above the level of lesion, no significant changes were observed in vibration, thermal, cold or heat perception thresholds between the first and the second assessment. Monofilament threshold to light touch was lower on the second visit. The most consistent findings, however, were the changes to thermal pain appreciation. In all the five patients, there was either a marked increase in threshold or no appreciation of pain to cold as low as 0°C on one or both sides on the second assessment. There were also significant elevations in heat pain thresholds from one assessment to the next. Since cold and heat pain thresholds showed marked changes at two time points at varied and relatively long intervals after injury, it appears that evoked pain thresholds may vary more than detection perception thresholds. The alterations in thermal pain threshold may indicate differential changes to the spinothalamic nociceptive pathway close to the site of lesion that are not reflected in other ascending tracts. In the zone of partial preservation, there were no significant changes in monofilament, vibration or thermal thresholds between the first and second visit. Below the level of lesion, there remained a total sensory loss.\nIn five incomplete SCI patients, there were no significant changes in any sensory modalities above or below the level of lesion between the first and second visit (average 27 weeks separation). Only one incomplete patient with neurogenic pain participated in the repeatability study, reporting increased pain (VAS at rest rated 10 compared to 8.4 in the first visit). In another incomplete patient, a clear change over three segments in the last normal sensory level was observed by the same investigator (from T12 D to L3 D).\nHistamine induced axon-reflex flare responses\nTests have been conducted in patients with complete SCI. 57 Axon-reflex vasodilation, as measured by laser doppler (flux), in response to subcutaneous injection of histamine, was present in all patients above and below the lesion, but was significantly diminished below the level of lesion, by an average 39% of control values. The flux increase was also significantly correlated with area of the flare. Histamine-induced axon-reflex flare responses would appear to provide a practical means of determining the level of SCI with respect to sensory and autonomic function.\nConclusions concerning QST\nQST detected abnormal, raised thermal perception thresholds in dermatomes clinically defined as normal (last normal sensory level) with ASIA. The technique is therefore more sensitive than the standard clinical examination, and has been shown to be a repeatable means of testing. QST offers a range of values compared to the standard clinical examination, and should improve the detection of natural recovery or of small changes after intervention. Skin-flare responses are significantly reduced below the level of a lesion. Although not providing a robust measure of spinal cord function, the test would appear to be a useful adjunct to other QST procedures.\nAutonomic component\nThe following noninvasive methods have been used to assess autonomic function:\ndetermination of sympathetic cholinergic activity using the sympathetic skin response (SSR) to electrical and physiological (sound, voluntary gasp & bladder tap) stimuli;\ncontinuous measurement of blood pressure and heart rate and derived cardiac and vasomotor parameters at rest and as responses to stimuli during SSR tests (Portapres II, TNO-TPD Biomedical Instruments, Amsterdam);\ndetermination of local cutaneous vasomotor activity using the axon-reflex vasodilation to heat provocation (thermostatic laser-Doppler probe, PF4, Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden).\nSympathetic skin response\nPrevious reports 58 , 59 suggested that SSRs might be elicited by appropriate stimuli when the thoracolumbar spinal cord is isolated from supraspinal structures in SCI. In our study 60 of 17 patients with complete cord section (C3–L1), SSRs in response to electrical nerve, stimulation were consistently absent below the level of lesion. A palmar response could be obtained to stimulation of the median nerve, provided the lesion was at or below T6. One exception was a complete SCI patient, assessed neurologically as T2 grade A on the ASIA scale, in whom a reduced palmar response was recorded. This suggests either that simply one or two segments (T1–T2) are sufficient to support the response or that the lesion was incomplete in respect of autonomic function. A further 21 patients with SCI have now been studied using physiological stimuli to elicit SSRs. The stimuli included an auditory click, a voluntary gasp, and a supra-pubic mechanical tap. Table 1 summarises the results from all patients. In patients with complete injury at levels C4–T5, weak (<50% control) palmar responses could be elicited in four out of six and plantar responses in two out of six patients. Figure 6 shows recordings from a complete SCI patient with a C7 lesion. Both palmar and plantar SSRs, with a delay of approximately 2 s, are evident in response to gasps and bladder taps but not to sound clicks. In seven further SCI patients with complete lesions from T6 to T11, palmar SSRs were observed more frequently and occasionally with near normal amplitudes, in good agreement with our previous study. 61 The only plantar SSRs were observed in a T11 complete patient. Eight further SCI patients with incomplete lesions were studied. The presence and amplitude of palmar and plantar SSRs in response to physiological stimuli did not appear to correlate with the neurological severity of the lesion, as judged by the ASIA rating. Furthermore, one incomplete patient (C4) had no responses to any of the physiological stimuli despite an ASIA grade C. We conclude that the presence of SSR is likely to reflect preserved descending autonomic pathways in the spinal cord in patients classified by ASIA as motor and sensory complete. Equally, a classification of sensory or motor incomplete cannot be taken to indicate the status of descending autonomic pathways.\nFull table\nCardiovascular assessment – systemic\nA variety of haemodynamic parameters were studied together with the SSR at rest and in response to different stimuli. These included systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, ejection fraction, and total peripheral resistance. The physiological stimuli used to elicit SSRs caused no significant changes in either control subjects, complete or incomplete SCI patients. We conclude from this negative result that the stimuli were insufficient to provoke sympathetic adrenergic changes sufficient to alter cardiac function or systemic haemodynamics.\nIn a preliminary study, four further SCI patients with complete injury (C4, C7, T4, and T6) have been studied using a variety of stimuli expected to elicit cardiovascular responses. Basal supine blood pressure and heart rate were similar in SCI patients and control subjects. Head-up tilt caused falls in blood pressure and increases in heart rate in the patients with cervical injury. The Valsalva manoeuvre showed only small changes in blood pressure, but this test was compromised by the difficulties experienced by SCI subjects in maintaining intrathoracic pressure. Pressor stimuli above the level of lesion (eg mental arithmetic) had no effect compared with control subjects where a modest rise in blood pressure occurred. Stimuli below the level of lesion (ice pack, bladder tap) that are known to cause an exaggerated rise in blood pressure leading to autonomic dysreflexia were ineffective. The combination of tilt table testing with other measures of systemic sympathetic activation and parasympathetic cardiac effects should provide overall measures of systemic vascular and cardiac autonomic control. 62 Note that caution is required with the use of a tilt-table in regard to postural hypotension. 63\nCardiovascular assessment – site specific\nSkin blood flow increases in response to local heating reaching an initial peak within 10 min, followed by a progressive further rise to a plateau lasting longer. The initial peak in heat-provoked vasodilatation is considered to be mediated by a sensory axon reflex and the longer plateau by the local release of nitric oxide. Using histamine injection, SCI patients were found to have diminished axon reflexes below the level of injury. 57 Since heat provocation provides a more acceptable physiological stimulus than histamine, our aim was to establish whether the former would provide a reliable test of the patency of the axon reflex in SCI. Four complete (T6–T9) and five incomplete (C4–L4) SCI patients were studied. There was no significant difference in resting skin blood flow or the initial peak response to heat provocation on the hand in SCI compared with normal control subjects. However, the peak response on the foot was significantly lower in complete SCI. The reduced vasodilatation below the level of a complete SCI may indicate a disturbance of the axon reflex or altered sympathetic vasomotor control. The result appears to provide a noninvasive means of evaluating localised sympathetic adrenergic control and a further means of determining the integrity of descending spinal autonomic pathways.\nTop of page\nGeneral conclusions\nThis article has reviewed the progress made by the Clinical Initiative into improving methods for detecting change and recovery in SCI in man. The Initiative, sponsored by the International Spinal Research Trust, is incomplete at this time. However, a number of advances in techniques for the assessment of SCI have emerged. Clearly, the usefulness of any suite of assessment tools will depend not only on the merits of the individual components, but also on the practicality of administering several tests to the one patient. A large number of tests should not present a problem if an individual is cooperative and the anticipated benefit from treatment is an adequate incentive. The Clinical Initiative arose from the anticipation that interventive remedial treatment for the repair of SCI will materialise in the next 5–10 years. In the first trials, it is anticipated that recovery may be limited to one or two spinal segments. Remedial intervention will most probably be offered to patients with thoracic injury, since treatment of the thoracic spinal cord is least likely to provoke increased disability. Thus, improved techniques necessary for monitoring recovery (or deterioration) over as little as one segment will clearly need to be more elaborate and time consuming than present tests. Furthermore, if the injury is to the thoracic spinal cord, the clinical and physiological tests will need to target organs innervated by those segments. This Initiative has identified a number of tools that are showing promise in meeting these aims. Bearing in mind also the need to restrict the duration of assessment to a minimum compatible with the durability of the patient, the following limited set of tests appears to be the most appropriate recommendation at this stage in the Clinical Initiative:\nconventional clinical, neurological assessment;\nquantitative sensory testing including electrical sensory perceptual threshold;\nsympathetic skin response.\nAlthough tailored to assess change in the thoracic segments, this protocol (with the exception of reflex testing of specific back muscles) is broadly applicable to injury at other segmental levels.\nTop of page\nReferences\nSmith M.

Several operating modes can be achieved by changing the on-off states of the switches in the front-end circuit. In generator driving mode, the battery bank is employed to elevate the phase voltage for fast excitation and demagnetization. In battery driving mode, the converter is reconfigured as a four-level converter, and the capacitor is used as an additional charge capacitor to produce multilevel voltage outputs, which enhances the torque capability. The operating modes of the proposed drive are explained and the phase current and voltage are analyzed in details. The battery charging is naturally achieved by the demagnetization current in motoring mode and by the regenerative current in braking mode. Moreover, the battery can be charged by the external AC source or generator through the proposed converter when the vehicle is in standstill condition. The SRM-based PHEV can operate at different speeds by coordinating the power flow between the generator and battery. Simulation in MATLAB/Simulink and experiments on a three-phase 12/8 SRM confirm the effectiveness of the proposed converter topology.\nDocuments\nIntegrated multilevel converter for switched reluctance motor drives\nRights statement: © 2016 IEEE.

Little is known about patterns of active travel or associated cardiovascular health benefits in low- and middle-income countries. This study examines mode and duration of travel to work in rural and urban India and associations between active travel and overweight, hypertension, and diabetes.\nMethods and Findings\nCross-sectional study of 3,902 participants (1,366 rural, 2,536 urban) in the Indian Migration Study. Associations between mode and duration of active travel and cardiovascular risk factors were assessed using random-effect logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, caste, standard of living, occupation, factory location, leisure time physical activity, daily fat intake, smoking status, and alcohol use. Rural dwellers were significantly more likely to bicycle (68.3% versus 15.9%; p<0.001) to work than urban dwellers. The prevalence of overweight or obesity was 50.0%, 37.6%, 24.2%, 24.9%; hypertension was 17.7%, 11.8%, 6.5%, 9.8%; and diabetes was 10.8%, 7.4%, 3.8%, 7.3% in participants who travelled to work by private transport, public transport, bicycling, and walking, respectively. In the adjusted analysis, those walking (adjusted risk ratio [ARR] 0.72; 95% CI 0.58–0.88) or bicycling to work (ARR 0.66; 95% CI 0.55–0.77) were significantly less likely to be overweight or obese than those travelling by private transport. Those bicycling to work were significantly less likely to have hypertension (ARR 0.51; 95% CI 0.36–0.71) or diabetes (ARR 0.65; 95% CI 0.44–0.95). There was evidence of a dose-response relationship between duration of bicycling to work and being overweight, having hypertension or diabetes. The main limitation of the study is the cross-sectional design, which limits causal inference for the associations found.\nConclusions\nWalking and bicycling to work was associated with reduced cardiovascular risk in the Indian population. Efforts to increase active travel in urban areas and halt declines in rural areas should be integral to strategies to maintain healthy weight and prevent NCDs in India.\nPlease see later in the article for the Editors' Summary\nEditors' Summary\nBackground\nNoncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and obesity (excessive body fat) are major threats to global health. Every year, more than 36 million people (including 29 million in LMICs) die from NCDs—nearly two-thirds of the world's annual deaths. Cardiovascular diseases (conditions that affect the heart and the circulation), diabetes, cancer, and respiratory diseases are responsible for most NCD-related deaths. Obesity is a risk factor for all these NCDs and the global prevalence of obesity (the proportion of the world's population that is obese) has nearly doubled since 1980. In 2008, 35% of adults were overweight and 11% were obese. One reason for the growing burden of both obesity and NCDs is increasing physical inactivity. Regular physical activity helps to maintain a healthy body weight and to prevent or delay the onset of NCDs. For an adult, 30 minutes of moderate physical activity—walking briskly or cycling, for example—five times a week is sufficient to promote and maintain health. But the daily lives of people in both developed and developing countries are becoming increasingly sedentary and, nowadays, at least 60% of the world's population does not do even this modest amount of exercise.\nWhy Was This Study Done?\nStrategies to increase physical activity levels often promote active travel (walking, cycling, and using public transport). The positive impact of active travel on physical activity levels and cardiovascular health is well established in high-income countries, but little is known about the patterns of active travel or the health benefits associated with active travel in poorer countries. In this cross-sectional study (an investigation that measures population characteristics at a single time point), the researchers examine the mode and duration of travel to work in rural and urban India and associations between active travel and overweight/obesity, hypertension (high blood pressure, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease), and diabetes. In India, a lower middle-income country, the prevalence of overweight and NCDs is projected to increase rapidly over the next two decades. Moreover, rapid unplanned urbanization and a large increase in registered motor vehicles has resulted in inadequate development of the public transport infrastructure and hazardous conditions for walking and cycling in most Indian towns and cities.\nWhat Did the Researchers Do and Find?\nFor their study, researchers analyzed physical activity and health data collected from participants in the Indian Migration Study, which examined the association between migration from rural to urban areas and obesity and diabetes risk. People living in rural areas were more likely to cycle to work than people living in towns and cities (68.3% versus 15.9%). Among people who travelled to work by private transport, public transport, walking, and cycling, the prevalence of overweight or obesity was 50.0%, 37.6%, 24.9%, and 24.2%, respectively. Similar patterns were seen for the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes. After adjustment for factors that affect the risk of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes (for example, daily fat intake and leisure time physical activity), people walking or cycling to work were less likely to be overweight or obese than those travelling by public transport, and those cycling to walk were less likely to have hypertension or diabetes. Finally, people with long cycle rides to work had a lower risk of being overweight or having hypertension or diabetes than people with short cycle rides.\nWhat Do These Findings Mean?\nThese findings suggest that, as in high-income settings, walking and cycling to work are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease in India. Because this was a cross-sectional study, these findings do not prove that active travel reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease—people who cycle to work may share other unknown characteristics that are actually responsible for their reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Moreover, this study did not consider non-cardiovascular outcomes associated with active travel that might affect health such as increased exposure to air pollution. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that programs designed to maintain healthy weight and prevent NCDs in India should endeavor to increase active travel in urban areas and to halt declines in rural areas by, for example, increasing investment in public transport and improving the safety and convenience of walking and cycling routes in urban areas.\nAdditional Information\nInformation about the Indian Migration Study is available\nCitation: Millett C, Agrawal S, Sullivan R, Vaz M, Kurpad A, Bharathi AV, et al.

The Action Plan of the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of NCDs urges member states to “introduce transport policies that promote active and safe methods of travelling to and from schools and workplaces” and to “ensure that physical environments support safe active commuting.” [3] . While a number of high-income countries, most notably the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany, have implemented effective policies to increase active travel [4] , such efforts remain largely undeveloped in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as India, where the bulk of the NCD burden falls.\nEfforts to increase active travel in India face a number of powerful countervailing influences, including rapid, unplanned urbanisation and substantial growth in motor vehicle ownership. The percentage of the Indian population living in urban areas increased from 23% in 1980 to 31% in 2010 and is projected to exceed 50% by 2050. There was a 38-fold increase (3 to 115 million) in the number of registered motor vehicles in the country between 1981 and 2009 [5] . Successive governments have prioritised investment in road infrastructure since the National Highway Act in 1995 and planning for urban growth at the local level has generally been weak and haphazard [6] . In combination, these factors have resulted in inadequate development of the public transport infrastructure and hazardous conditions for walking and bicycling in most Indian cities and towns.\nThe positive impacts of active travel on physical activity levels and cardiovascular health are well established in high income countries [7] , [8] . For example, a US study found that users of public transport, walk for an average of 19 min as part of their daily commute and that 29% of public transport users achieve recommended levels of daily physical activity from this travel alone [9] . However, there has been little research examining patterns of active travel and the associated health benefits in India and other LMICs. Further, there is sparse information on how patterns of active travel differ in rural and urban India. This is an important knowledge gap given that the prevalence of overweight, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is substantially higher in urban India [10] – [12] . This study has two aims: (1) to characterise modes of active travel to work in urban and rural populations in India; (2) to examine associations between modes of active travel (walking, bicycling, public transport) to work and overweight and obesity, hypertension, and diabetes in India.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Respondents\nThis study used data from the Indian Migration Study (IMS) conducted during 2005–2007. The design and sampling methodology of the IMS has been described previously [10] , [13] . Briefly, the IMS is a cross-sectional sib-pair study, part of a larger cardiovascular risk factor surveillance system [14] . The IMS was carried out in factory settings in four cities from northern (Lucknow, Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd), central (Nagpur, Indorama Synthetics Ltd), and southern India (Hyderabad, Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd; and Bangalore, Hindustan Machine Tools Ltd). Information on rural-to-urban migration was solicited from factory workers and their co-resident spouses. Factory workers and their co-resident spouses who had migrated from rural to urban areas, along with a 25% random sample of urban non-migrants and their co-resident spouses, were asked to participate in the study. Each migrant participant was asked to identify a non-migrant sibling residing in a rural area, preferably of the same gender and close to them in age, who was then also invited to participate in the study. In a small number of cases where no rural sibling was available (<5%), a cousin or a close friend from the same village was invited. There were no other exclusion criteria at this recruitment stage. This convenience sampling strategy resulted in rural dwelling siblings being drawn from anywhere in the country (18 of the 29 states), reflecting the migration patterns of the factory workers and their spouses. A substantial proportion came from the four large states in which the factories were based (Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka). The urban participants were also asked to identify a non-migrant, urban dwelling sibling for inclusion in the study.\nOf the 7,594 migrant and non-migrant factory workers and their co-resident spouses identified as being eligible for the India Migration Study, 7,102 (94%) agreed in principle to complete the clinical examination with their sibling, of whom 3,537 (50%) sib-pairs eventually participated by the close of field work. The final IMS sample was 7,067 respondents as seven respondents did not complete the clinical examination. Our analysis is based on 3,902 respondents aged ≥18 y who reported being in the workforce. Exclusions included respondents who reported being unemployed/did housework (2,508), had no information on their mode of transport to work (308), or had no information on their migration status (349). Ethics committee approval for the IMS was obtained from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences Ethics Committee, reference number A-60/4/8/2004.\nData Collection and Measurements\nAn interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic, physical activity, and health data from respondents. Trained personnel took anthropometric measures of height and weight from all participants during a clinic visit. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a portable stadiometer with a base plate (Leicester height measure, Chasmore Ltd.). Weight was measured twice, to the nearest 0.1 kg using a digital scale (Model PS16), with participants removing their shoes and wearing light clothing. Blood pressure was measured twice using an Omron M5-I automatic machine in sitting position using the right upper arm and an appropriate sized cuff after a period of 5-min rest. The average of these two measures taken was used for these analyses. Participants were asked to attend the clinic visit fasting and the time of last meal was recorded. Glucose was measured on the day of blood sample collection in local laboratories at each site with the GOD-PAP method using RANDOX kits. The quality of local assays was checked with regular external standards and internal duplicate assays and monitored by a reference laboratory at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. Daily fat intake was assessed from a validated, interviewer-administered semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire which is described elsewhere [15] . The questionnaire assessed frequency of intake (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) of 184 commonly consumed food items. Information collected in the food frequency questionnaire was converted into average daily consumption of nutrient and food groups, using nutrient databases that were developed for the study. A validated, interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to assess physical activity in the past month across multiple domains including discretionary leisure time, household chores, work, sleep, sedentary activities, and other common daily activities in the IMS [16] . Respondents were asked whether they undertook sports, games, or other physical activities such as walking for leisure. Those responding affirmatively were asked about the frequency (daily; 5–6 times/week; 2–4 times/week; once a week, 2–3 times/month; once a month) and the average duration in minutes of each leisure activity undertaken. Metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) were estimated as the ratio of resting metabolic rate where 1 MET is equivalent to the energy expenditure value of sitting quietly using an established method [16] . Activity data, including for leisure time physical activity, were summarised as MET hours per day. All protocols and equipment were pilot tested prior to the study commencing. Fieldworkers at the four study sites underwent joint training sessions and standardisation at the outset and subsequently every 6 mo. Anthropometric instruments were calibrated at the start of each clinic session.\nPredictor Variable\nActive Travel To Work.\nInformation on mode and duration of travel to work was gathered from respondents as part of the questionnaire on physical activity [16] . Mode of transport to work was categorized as private transport (car and motorcycles), public transport (three wheeler, bus, and train), walking and bicycling. Respondents were asked to estimate the duration of travel to their workplace in minutes. We doubled this to obtain the total amount of daily travel to and from the workplace. We categorized respondents according to whether their daily active travel (to and from work) was 30 min or greater, reflecting international guidelines on recommended physical activity levels [1] .\nOutcome Variables\nOverweight was defined using two cut points; body mass index (BMI)≥23 kg/m2 (suitable for Asian populations [17] ) and BMI≥25 kg/m2. Obesity was defined as BMI≥30 kg/m2. Hypertension was defined as a report of a doctor diagnosis of hypertension. Undiagnosed hypertension was defined as a systolic BP≥140 mm Hg or a diastolic BP≥90 mm Hg in the absence of a doctor diagnosis. Diabetes was defined as a report of a doctor diagnosis of diabetes. Undiagnosed diabetes was defined by WHO fasting plasma glucose criterion of >7.0 mmol/l in the absence of a doctor diagnosis of diabetes [18] . Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) scores to estimate insulin resistance were calculated from fasting blood glucose and serum insulin levels using a standard formula of plasma glucose (mol/l)×plasma insulin (mU/l)/22.5), on the basis of the original approach [19] . HOMA has been validated by comparison with biochemical markers of insulin resistance in healthy Indian people, yielding moderate correlations [20] . We have divided the HOMA scores into tertiles and created a binary variable (high versus medium/low). Our rationale for using both doctor diagnosed and undiagnosed hypertension and diabetes as outcome measures was to address the possibility of reverse causality, i.e., individuals with diagnosed diabetes and hypertension may receive physician advice to increase physical activity. The number of participants with missing data for our main outcomes was negligible (<10 respondents for each variable). Full details on data completeness in the study can be found elsewhere [10] .\nCovariates\nCovariates in our analysis included age, sex, caste/tribe status, standard of living index (SLI), occupation, factory location, leisure time physical activity (MET hours/day), daily fat intake (grams per day), current alcohol intake (yes/no), and smoking status (current smoker/non smoker). “Scheduled castes” and “scheduled tribes” are identified by the Government of India as socially and economically backward and needing protection from social injustice and exploitation. “Other backward class” is a diverse collection of intermediate castes that were considered low in the traditional caste hierarchy but are clearly above scheduled castes. “General” is thus a default residual group that enjoys higher status in the caste hierarchy. The SLI is based on following assets in the household: quality of house; toilet facilities; source of lighting and drinking water; possession of clock, radio, television, bicycle, motorcycle, car, tractor, refrigerator, and telephone. A score of less than 20 indicates low SLI, 21–26 indicates medium SLI, and 27 and above indicates high SLI. Occupation was categorized as manual and non-manual.\nStatistical Analysis\nAs the study is based on factory workers, their spouses, and a sibling of each factory worker and spouse these data cannot be treated as coming from independent individuals and the data structure must be accounted for in the statistical analysis [10] . A general multilevel random effects model framework that can accommodate this data structure was used [21] . In the multilevel model the between-pair variation is specified explicitly and included in the model.\nStandard descriptive analysis was done using chi square tests. Association between mode of transport and duration of travel was assessed using random-effect logistic regression models after adjusting for the sib-pair design, factory location, and potential confounders. Separate models were run with BMI and MET hours/day as additional covariates. Comparisons were made between mode of transport and duration of travel using the logistic regression with a pair-specific random effect to estimate the within-pair comparisons for all the binary outcomes. Odds ratios for associations between mode of transport and outcomes were calculated and adjustments made for age, sex, caste, standard of living, occupation, factory location, leisure time physical activity, daily fat intake, smoking status, and alcohol use as these may confound the associations. We then corrected for possible overestimation of odds ratios for common outcomes by adjusting to approximate risk ratios using an established method [22] . All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA software version 10 (StataCorp. 2009. Stata Statistical Software: Release 10. StataCorp LP).\nResults\nOf the 3,902 eligible participants, 1,366 were rural dwellers and 2,536 were urban dwellers ( Table 1 ). There were no major differences between migrant and non-migrant urban dwellers so they were combined into a single group. The mean age of respondents was 42.2 y (standard deviation [SD] 9.6) and 87.2% were men. A significantly higher percentage of rural dwellers were employed in manual occupations than urban dwellers (75.1%, 51.9%, respectively; p<0.001). Rural dwellers were significantly more likely to belong to lower caste groups and be in the lowest SLI group than (69.8%, 16.7%; p<0.001). Rural dwellers were significantly less likely to be overweight (19.1%, 44.5%; p<0.001) and significantly less likely to have doctor diagnosed hypertension (5.1%, 15.3%; p<0.001) or doctor diagnosed diabetes (2.8%, 9.7%; p<0.001) than urban dwellers.\nDownload:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001459.t007\nDiscussion\nWe found a lower likelihood of overweight in participants that walked or bicycled to work compared to those that used private transport. Participants who bicycled to work were less likely to have hypertension or diabetes than those that travelled to work by private transport. These findings are consistent with a growing evidence base derived from studies conducted in high-income settings and upper middle-income countries [23] . This includes evidence that individuals who take active transport to work have higher overall levels of physical activity and are less likely to be overweight or obese [24] – [26] . A meta-analysis of studies conducted prior to 2007 found that active travel to work was associated with an 11% reduction in cardiovascular outcomes (pooling cardiovascular mortality, incident coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension diabetes) [7] . The CARDIA study found that active commuting was inversely associated with BMI, obesity, triglyceride level, blood pressure, and fasting insulin and positively associated with high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol [27] . An earlier study conducted in Copenhagen found that bicycling to work was associated with 28% decrease in mortality after adjustment for leisure time physical activity [28] . A Finnish study found that daily walking or cycling to and from work for more than 30 min was inversely associated with risk of type 2 diabetes [29] .\nWe were able to identify a dose response relationship between duration of bicycling to work and being overweight, having hypertension and diabetes in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses, which strengthens a causal interpretation of these associations. For duration of walking, dose response relationships were seen in unadjusted analyses but attenuated for hypertension and diabetes. The similar findings in our main analyses, which allow for the sib-pair design, to those from our analyses that examine associations in between and within sib-pairs, provide stronger evidence that these associations are robust. The only exception to this is the association between walking to work and overweight, which is significant in the between-sibling-pairs analysis but not so (attenuates to null) in the within-sibling-pairs analysis. While this does raise a question about the robustness of this association, the most likely explanation is that this is a chance finding given the consistency of other comparisons made. The strengths of our study include the large sample and use of sibling pair design. However, like all cross-sectional studies, the data from this study may be prone to recall bias and there remains the possibility of residual confounding (the sib pair design increases the potential for confounding although it reduces the potential for confounding by genetic factors). For example, duration of active travel is based on self-report and may not be accurate. As only the main mode of travel was recorded, we did not have information on how long respondents spent walking (or cycling) to access points if public transport was used. In an effort to address the possibility of reverse causality, i.e., individuals with diagnosed hypertension may receive physician advice to increase physical activity, we examined associations between active travel and undiagnosed hypertension and diabetes. Several of these findings were consistent with a protective effect of active travel although only the association between bicycling and undiagnosed hypertension was statistically significant. Longitudinal studies are required to better determine cause and effect. There is a risk of selection bias in this study due to non-response and missing values. Our sample size was too small to examine associations between mode of active travel and cardiovascular risk factors in rural and urban groups separately. We did not have information on exposure to ambient or household air pollution, which has been associated with an elevated risk of hypertension and diabetes [30] , [31] . However, as this exposure is likely to be socially patterned, adjustment for socio-economic factors (which is done in our analyses) will provide some control for these possible effects. Our urban sample consisted of factory employees whose patterns of active travel may differ from urban residents generally. Mean travel times for walking (22 min) and cycling (26 min) to and from work among respondents living in urban areas appear low indicating that many lived close to the factories. This may mean that the proportion of people undertaking active travel in our sample is higher and the associated cardiovascular benefits identified here are lower (given the mean duration is lower than that recommend by international guidance [1] ) than is typical for similar populations in India. Unfortunately there are few data on patterns of active travel in India available to compare our findings with. However, the high percentage of urban respondents using private transport for commuting (45%) reflects recent dramatic growth in car and motorbike ownership and lack of investment in public transport infrastructure in India [5] , [6] . We were not able to examine non-cardiovascular outcomes that may be of interest (e.g., injuries sustained during active travel, exposure to air pollution, effects on mental health outcomes).\nIndia is facing a growing burden of NCDs, particularly from diabetes and CVD [11] , [32] . For example, total deaths from CVD are projected to increase from 2.7 million in 2004 to 4.0 million in 2030 33] . While the prevalence of overweight and obesity remained relatively stable in India since the 1990s [34] , [35] , this is projected to increase rapidly in the next two decades [36] . Our findings indicate that increasing active travel could be important in restraining this increase. Differences in active travel in urban and rural groups found in our study may partly explain the higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in urban India and the negative impact of rural-to-urban migration on CVD risk factors [10] , [37] .\nEfforts to increase active travel in urban areas and halt declines in rural areas should be integral to strategies to maintain healthy weight and prevent NCDs in India. This should include greater investment in public transport and improving the safety and convenience of bicycling and walking in Indian towns and cities [38] – [40] . Specific measures to discourage car use should also be considered and could include carbon rationing, road pricing, car parking restrictions, and reduced speed limits [41] . Direct to consumer subsidies and workplace facilities, such as bicycle parking and showers, to encourage active travel over private vehicle use have been associated with improved health outcomes in high-income countries and should be considered [42] . Further research evaluating the impact of interventions to increase active travel in India and other LMICs is warranted. An assessment of potential future health benefits of increasing active travel should account for the potentially deleterious effects of increased exposure to air pollution and road traffic injuries alongside the substantial long term benefits of reduced carbon emissions.\nSupporting Information\n(DOCX)\nAcknowledgments\nAn earlier version of the paper was presented at the Geneva Health Forum, Geneva, Switzerland, 18–20 April 2012.

For most of the 20th Century, terahertz radiation, then referred to as sub-millimeter wave or far-infrared radiation, was mainly utilized by astronomers and some spectroscopists. Following the development of laser based terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in the 1980s and 1990s the field of THz science and technology expanded rapidly, to the extent that it now touches many areas from fundamental science to 'real world' applications. For example THz radiation is being used to optimize materials for new solar cells, and may also be a key technology for the next generation of airport security scanners. While the field was emerging it was possible to keep track of all new developments, however now the field has grown so much that it is increasingly difficult to follow the diverse range of new discoveries and applications that are appearing. At this point in time, when the field of THz science and technology is moving from an emerging to a more established and interdisciplinary field, it is apt to present a roadmap to help identify the breadth and future directions of the field. The aim of this roadmap is to present a snapshot of the present state of THz science and technology in 2017, and provide an opinion on the challenges and opportunities that the future holds. To be able to achieve this aim, we have invited a group of international experts to write 18 sections that cover most of the key areas of THz science and technology. We hope that The 2017 Roadmap on THz science and technology will prove to be a useful resource by providing a wide ranging introduction to the capabilities of THz radiation for those outside or just entering the field as well as providing perspective and breadth for those who are well established. We also feel that this review should serve as a useful guide for government and funding agencies.\nExport citation and abstract\nBibTeX RIS\nOriginal content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence .

Laser action arises from transitions between electronic subbands formed in a series of quantum wells and, by 'cascading' a number of such active regions together, the injected electrons undergo multiple lasing transitions as they pass through the device (see figure 1a ). The entire characteristics of the laser can therefore be controlled through bandstructure engineering and by the design of the semiconductor superlattice. The QCL concept has enabled powerful and compact sources to be realized in previously inaccessible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the mid-IR, QCLs have achieved impressive performance levels with multi-Watt output power, room temperature (RT) and continuous wave (CW) operation with wall-plug efficiencies of up to 21% at RT, and can cover a wide spectral range of 2.7–25 µm. Beyond the Restrahlen band (>50 µm), QCLs have also shown remarkable performances over the range 1–5 THz range, with demonstration of high powers (>1 W), photonic and far-field engineering, a quantum limited linewidth, frequency combs and pulse generation [ 2 ]. These advances have permitted THz QCLs to be made commercially available and, although cryogenic cooling is still required, this can be achieved conveniently and inexpensively with Stirling coolers. A wide range of applications are now being targeted from local oscillators for astronomy, to use in metrology and non-destructive imaging [ 2 ]. Although there remain challenges, the further development and exploitation of THz QCLs is crucial owing to the unparalleled success of these devices in terms of their output power and wavelength agility in a compact, potentially inexpensive and user-friendly geometry.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 1. (a) Bandstructure of two periods of an LO phonon depopulation-based QCL active region for emission at 3.3 THz (13.7 meV, electronic states 5 and 4). (b) Modal profile of the two waveguides used for THz QCLs: single plasmon, where the THz mode is weakly confined and has a large overlap with the substrate; and, metal–metal, where the mode is strongly confined between two metal layers.\nDownload figure:\nStandard image High-resolution image Export PowerPoint slide\nCurrent and future challenges.\nAfter a decade of research, the operation temperature of THz QCLs has progressively risen to 199.5 K in pulsed mode [ 3 ] (and in the absence of an applied magnetic field), although this maximum temperature has stayed static now for a number of years. The GaAs/AlGaAs material system and active region designs are likely to be the limiting factors. Although commercial systems exploiting such QCLs can be based around Stirling coolers, for more mainstream applications and lower cost, Peltier cooling would be beneficial. However, this will require an increase in the current maximum operating temperature to around 240 K.\nAn alternative methodology is to leverage advances in high-power two-colour mid-IR QCLs for room temperature, intra-cavity THz difference frequency generation [ 4 ]. Although the emission is not as powerful as from THz QCLs, this route has shown intriguing breakthroughs in temperature operation and tunability. A challenge here is to overcome the wall-plug efficiency limit, which is at best just ~10−6.\nTwo types of THz QCL waveguides are implemented: the surface plasmon (single metal) waveguide, and the metal–metal (MM) waveguide (Figure 1b ). The latter is beneficial for higher temperature operation, and for lower QCL frequency operation, although at the cost of a poorer output beam profile and lower output power. Initial efforts to address this employed facet-mounted lenses, horn-antennas and photonic crystals. Nonetheless, these do not simultaneously satisfy the requirements of monolithic geometry, high power and a controlled far-field radiation profile. Photonic heterostructured and 3rd order DFB geometries currently provide potentially valuable solutions to address this challenge [ 5 ]. These approaches, however, are all frequency-selective in nature, and are therefore not appropriate for broadband coupling that would be required for future challenges such as broadband amplifiers, pulse generation and frequency combs (see below). Broadband, efficient integrated couplers for THz QCLs therefore represent an important future goal, particularly operating at very high powers.\nTuning of the QCL frequency emission is also an important challenge. Although the spectral linewidth of the QCL [ 6 ] is ideal for gas spectroscopy, tuning remains non-ideal. Although a range of solutions have been realized including through temperature control, multi-section DFB structures [ 7 ], and Vernier tuning [ 8 ], the tuning range is proving to be limited. An important step would be the realization of an external cavity with a THz QCL gain medium. For this, efficient anti-reflection coatings that can cover a large spectral range need to be developed.\nThe investigation of schemes for developing broadband THz QCL frequency combs (FCs), is a topic of considerable current interest [ 9 , 10 ] where the compensation of the index dispersion over a large frequency range is vital. Complementary to this is short pulse generation from QCLs, where currently 10 ps pulses can be generated at best, with relatively low output powers [ 11 , 12 ]. This is a direct consequence of the ultrafast QCL dynamics. Future development will be needed to meet the challenge of simultaneous generation of much shorter pulses with high powers through new modelocking geometries.\nAn important challenge will be to bring these developments in source technology towards systems, requiring new approaches to THz detection in terms of rapidity and sensitivity at high temperatures. Promising directions include self-mixing, down- and up-conversion, and nano-detection technologies (QWIPs, nanowires or quantum-dot approaches). This will work towards complete THz systems, promising breakthroughs in optical communication, quantum computing, dual-comb spectroscopy and time-of-flight tomography.\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges. Given the temperature performance ceiling of current THz frequency QCLs based on the GaAs/AlGaAs materials system, other semiconductor materials such as InGaAs and InAs have gained attention, not least owing to their lower effective masses and therefore higher gain. High quality growth with control of the optical losses is vital here, however. More exotic systems currently being explored include SiGe heterostructures, III-nitride quantum wells and even II–VI systems. The latter two materials have large LO phonon energies (>70 meV) and so the major bottleneck for high-temperature operation (thermally activated LO-phonon scattering) should be dramatically suppressed. An even more radical approach to suppress non-radiative scattering is to implement a cascade laser within a series of quantum-dots, rather than through quantum-wells. This would potentially result in zero energy dispersion in momentum space, thus reducing non-radiative scattering [ 13 ]. Both top-down and bottom-up investigations of quantum-dot patterning are being made or have been proposed, with the former dependent on improvements in advanced processing techniques and surface passivation, and the latter requiring new growth techniques such as in situ site-controlled dots.\nIn the context of room temperature intracavity THz difference frequency generation, this would benefit from advances in mid-IR QCLs with a shift towards shorter mid-IR wavelengths (~5 µm) that show better wall-plug efficiency that will directly improve the THz output power. Although the current geometry relies on the Cherenkov coupling scheme, and is efficient in extracting the THz radiation, the use of both passive waveguides and more traditional phase matching schemes may allow the realization of an electrically pumped chip-based THz optical parametric oscillator.\nTo address the ambition for integrated spectrometers and broadly tunable sensing systems, different technological solutions can be envisioned: arrays of vertical-emitting ring-cavities or distributed feedback lasers in master-oscillator power amplifier configurations [ 14 ], and heterogeneous QCLs in external cavity systems, represent, respectively, very promising solutions. A possible option for broadband, efficient integrated THz out-couplers could be the exploitation of quasi-periodic structures (1D gratings, 2D quasi-crystals) or even random resonators to break the symmetry of the radiating modes [ 15 ]. In terms of THz QCL tunability, extremely narrow double-metal cavities combined with refined MEMS systems [ 16 ] or surface-emitting resonators in coupled microcavity architectures, exploiting metallic mirrors, graphene or metamaterials have potential. Finally, to address the development of a broadband QCL FC, group velocity dispersion can be significantly reduced through new active regions, waveguide designs, and integrated chirped mirrors. Short pulse generation via mode-locking [ 17 ] can also take advantage of these advances and by implementing hybrid active-passive approaches or by devising suitable saturable absorber components with novel architectures, or by exploiting novel, still unexplored materials, with appropriate THz absorption features.\nConcluding remarks.\nAlthough there remain considerable challenges ahead, THz frequency QCLs are currently the only compact source operating with high output powers above 1 THz. Through the potential advances highlighted above, further applications and functionalities of these devices will be found ranging from fundamental science to applied research, including their use as new sources for nonlinear optics, imaging, spectroscopy and trace gas analysis, inter alia. There remain open questions on the operation of these devices, including their high temperature performance, their dynamics related to pulse generation, and the possibility to realize extremely broadband frequency combs. Further, QCLs will accompany new advances in detector technology, such as coherent detection and nano-detection techniques, to provide powerful, inexpensive and compact THz systems.\n2. Intense laser-based THz sources\nMatthias C Hoffmann\nStandard image High-resolution image Export PowerPoint slide\nTunable, phase stable multicycle pulses in the mid-infrared (15–30 THz) region can be efficiently obtained via difference frequency generation processes in materials such as GaSe [ 23 ]. Since the wavelengths are inherently shorter, much higher peak field strengths (>100 MV cm−1) can be achieved due to tighter focusing. Finally, asymmetric ionization processes in plasmas can be used to produce short ultra-broadband pulses covering a wide frequency spectrum reaching well into the infrared [ 20 ], but with relatively low field amplitude per frequency unit.\nTo study effects far from equilibrium with low THz frequencies single-cycle pulses at will require roughly a tenfold increase in field strength at the sample.\nCurrently, no intense laser-based sources currently exist which provide tuneable multicycle THz radiation in the range of 5–15 THz. The existence of such sources is crucial to resonantly excite optical phonons or other collective modes in this important frequency range. This new 'THz gap' will be a major challenge for source development in the coming years.\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges.\nA major research direction in the coming years will be scaling up the energy of single-cycle THz pulses to reach 100 µJ–1 mJ pulse energies at ~1 THz, and associated peak field levels that approach 10 MV cm−1. Such a source will have a direct scientific impact by overcoming the peak field strength limit and compete directly with electron-beam based single- cycle methods. Development will be relatively straightforward and use scaling of existing techniques by using larger area size crystals, stronger laser sources and improved cooling. For rectification in organic crystals this will likely entail the use of new femtosecond laser technologies in the 1200–1500 nm wavelength range such as Cr:Forsterite lasers, and large area mosaics of nonlinear crystals to avoid damage [ 24 ].\nGeneration of intense, narrowband and tuneable pulses in the region of 5–15 THz will present a formidable future challenge. Such a source addresses a current unmet need in materials science applications where resonant excitation with moderate to high field strength is needed. One possible option will be using a difference frequency generation scheme with picosecond laser pulses. This will require tailored laser sources as well as novel nonlinear materials with high χ(2) and transparency window for phonon absorption. Alternative solutions might entail quasi-phase matched optical rectification, again requiring research and development of suitable nonlinear materials providing adequate phase matching, low THz absorption, high damage threshold and high nonlinear constants.\nConcluding remarks.\nLaser based intense THz sources have progressed tremendously in the last decade. They are now being used to study materials in THz pump experiments that have been previously impossible. Scaling up of current single sources will enhance our understanding of material behavior in the limit of extremely strong THz pulses, where the instantaneous electromagnetic fields exceed the DC breakdown values by a significant amount. Developing tailored pump solutions in the 5–15 THz range will enable novel avenues of control in complex material systems by targeting low energy collective phenomena directly. The future of THz science looks bright indeed.\n3. THz vacuum electronics\nJohn Booske1, Claudio Paoloni2,\n1 Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Wisconsin - Madison, 1415 Engineering Drive, Madison, WI 53706, USA\n2 Engineering Department, Lancaster University, Lancaster, LA1 4YR UK\nStatus.\nAfter 110 years, the oldest electron device, the vacuum tube, has evolved from kHz to THz and mW to MW, as the only practical device for many important applications requiring efficient, compact, medium-to-high power, long-operating-life electromagnetic radiation sources [ 27 ]. Vacuum electronic devices (VEDs) convert electrical stored energy into kinetic energy of an accelerated electron beam, which is then converted into electromagnetic field energy with the aid of electromagnetic waveguides or cavities, defined as an interaction zone or circuit (figure 3 ) [ 28 ]. Presently, numerous types of VEDs are available, including traveling wave tubes (TWTs), klystrons, magnetrons, gyrotrons and backwards wave oscillators (BWOs), for applications in satellite communications, radar, remote sensing and threat detection, electronic warfare, domestic cooking, industrial heating, space exploration, and scientific research [ 29 , 30 ]. Generally, the highest attainable frequency is determined by fabrication technologies and the theoretical scaling relation\n[ 27 , 28 ]. Due to physical limits on power density management, VEDs present the only practical solution for high power, compact, efficient sources (oscillators, amplifiers) of 0.1–1.0 THz radiation [ 27 – 31 ]. VED oscillators and amplifiers (figure 4 ) have been designed and operated at 0.220–1.0 THz and 10 mW–1 MW with high efficiencies (0.5–20% and above) [ 29 – 34 ]. Such performance is unachievable by any other technology [ 27 ]. The ability to achieve exceptionally high overall efficiency by spent beam energy recovery is uniquely available to VEDs and not possible with any other compact THz radiation source [ 28 ]. Further advances in 0.1–1.5 THz wideband amplifiers and oscillators with watt-level power sufficient to overcome atmospheric attenuation, and dimensions in the range of a few dm3, will enable new generations of multigigabit mobile communications networks (see section 17 ) and high resolution radar or remote sensing systems that are able to penetrate fog, dust, or other aerosols that obscure shorter-wavelength technologies. Other applications of future high power THz-regime VEDs will include stable frequency sources for imaging (see section 15 ), deep space communications, non-invasive healthcare diagnosis (see section 12 ), materials characterization (see section 13 ), radio astronomy (see section 14 ), and other scientific research technologies [ 27 – 31 ].\nZoom In\nStandard image High-resolution image Export PowerPoint slide\nCurrent and future challenges.\nIn compact VEDs based on classical physics mechanisms, the cross-sectional size of the circuit must scale with the free space wavelength. Therefore, to populate the THz gap, the transverse circuit dimensions of VED sources will typically need to be less than the free space wavelength, i.e. sub-mm [ 27 – 31 ]. Consequently, current and future challenges for compact THz VED sources involve reliably manufacturing miniature VED circuits that generate and tolerate high internal densities of beam and radiation power. Moreover, to minimize power dissipation, conducting surfaces will need excellent surface quality, including low impurity concentrations, low surface roughness (<20 nm) and moderate grain size (>100 nm) [ 33 ]. This means that innovations and advances are needed in the following areas:\nReliable manufacturing of miniature electromagnetic structures (cavities, slow-phase-velocity waveguides) having high quality surfaces and compatible with hard vacuum, high temperature thermal processing during manufacture, and highly precise alignment accuracy (micron-level or <0.1 degree) between components (cathode, beam optics, electromagnetic circuit, and beam collector)\nDesigns for high current electron beams with sub-mm cross-sections, at least in one transverse dimension\nNew cathodes that enable high current density, small cross-section electron beams with long lifetimes and lower cathode temperatures [ 28 – 30 , 35 ]\nNovel circuit designs having strong beam-wave interaction at THz frequencies with low voltage electron beams\nCompact, low-power, beam optics and confinement, keeping the beam away from impact on structure walls\nEfficient, broadband coupling of radiation out of the circuit (oscillators and amplifiers) and into the circuit (amplifiers)\nInnovative electromagnetic circuit designs with larger cross-sections that still provide stable, high power, efficient generation or amplification of THz-regime radiation.\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges.\nA new age of opportunity for THz-regime VEDs has emerged with the maturation of highly precise, highly accurate microfabrication techniques. These include extensions of conventional machining, such as nano-CNC milling, laser-machining, and micro-electro-discharge machining (micro-EDM), as well as the suite of lithographically-controlled etching, deposition and assembly techniques derived from micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) research [ 29 , 34 ]. Examples of the latter include deep reactive ion etching (DRIE), x-ray or ultraviolet LIGA (LIGA is a German acronym for lithography and molding), metallic and dielectric film deposition and diffusion bonding with substrate backside alignment [ 28 ]. The other recently emergent enablers are the numerous, exceptional advances in computational hardware, algorithms, and software. High performance, high throughput terascale computing is a stable, established technology. Highly sophisticated, 1-, 2-, and 3D, time-dependent, multiphysics models of electromagnetic fields, charged particle transport, thermal physics and engineering mechanics have been developed and validated, resulting, in many cases in 'first-pass' design success [ 28 , 31 ]. These simulation codes now permit quick and accurate predictive evaluation of innovative ideas prior to expensive experimental prototyping and validation.\nTo realize more powerful, compact, VED sources of THz radiation, scientists and engineers will need to leverage these new fabrication and simulation capabilities and also achieve innovations in electromagnetic THz circuits, beam optics, cathodes, materials and metrology. New circuits exploiting metamaterial or photonic crystal architectures might loosen the requirement for close beam-circuit proximity and still achieve strong beam-wave interaction [ 31 ]. Higher current density cathodes or advanced beam diode focusing optics would enable transporting higher beam power into the very small THz electromagnetic circuit cross-sections [ 27 , 29 , 31 , 36 ]. An alternative solution for high power beams in small THz circuits is to generate and focus innovative distributed beams, either laminar sheets or multiple beamlets, that are small in one cross-sectional dimension but spread the current out in the other cross-sectional dimension [ 27 , 31 ]. This requires new electromagnetic circuit ideas as well as well-designed magnetic focusing fields to avoid beam instability or to stably guide the many beamlets, respectively. Advances in permanent magnet materials or high temperature super-conductors would enable better magnetic focusing optics with less weight and size. The availability of high-current-density, long-lifetime cold cathodes would enable low-cost, self-aligned integration of the cathode, circuit, and collector during mass production manufacturing of micro-VEDs [ 28 , 30 ]. Advances in metallic 3D printing or new alloys for electroplating would provide more options for miniature circuit fabrication. However, the materials and processes would need to yield a circuit with dimensional features <100 µm, tolerance precision ~1 µm, high THz conductivity >\nS m−1, surface finish <20 nm [ 33 ], and stability against grain growth or stress-induced deformation during high-temperature thermal processing at hundreds of °C. Finally, advances are needed in metrology to characterize and verify the electromagnetic resonances or dispersion of THz circuits, precision alignment of components, magnetic field profiles inside the circuits, input and output radiation coupling efficiencies, and the structural, microstructural and electromagnetic properties of the circuit materials before and after manufacturing processes.\nConcluding remarks.\nThe progress toward compact, low weight, reliable, affordable, medium-to-high power THz vacuum electron devices (VEDs) is a fascinating adventure in a state-of-the-art, multidisciplinary field. The combined effort of a growing number of research groups active worldwide is yielding new designs, materials and fabrication methods to overcome the formidable obstacle posed by high-power-density VEDs with submillimetre dimensions. The future availability of low cost, high-power-density, THz VED sources will enable transformative advances in the world of THz applications, where the power, size, weight, availability and/or cost of present device options limit the outstanding and unique potential of THz radiation.\n4. Accelerator-based sources of terahertz radiation\nM Gensch1, P Weightman2 and G P Williams3\n1 Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Institute of Radiation Physics, Bautzner Landstr. 400, 01328 Dresden, Germany\n2 Physics Department, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 7ZE, UK\n3 Jefferson Laboratory, 12000 Jefferson Avenue—Suite 21 Newport News, VA 23606, USA\nStatus.\nThe potential of accelerator driven sources of electromagnetic radiation for scientific research across a wide variety of fields has long been recognized, and exploited internationally, most notably through the development of synchrotron storage rings into unique, broad band multi-user facilities for spectroscopy in the VUV to x-ray regime. The last three decades have seen increasing user interest in utilizing accelerator driven sources for research in the infrared and THz regime. The primary advantages of these sources over table-top sources, such as those described in sections 1 and 2 derive from their unique spectral brightness or power and their extreme fields and pulse energies. Historically the first applications of accelerator driven sources exploited the high spectral brightness and power available from infrared beamlines at storage rings [ 37 ], followed quickly by the use of dedicated user facilities such as IR/THz free electron lasers [ 38 ] and finally superradiant radiation [ 39 ], where the bunch length of the electrons is less than the wavelength of the emitted radiation, from energy recovery linacs (ERLs) [ 40 ]. The primary applications of this first generation of sources are brightness-limited spectroscopic techniques such as far-field microscopy or investigations of processes that require high average power such as action spectroscopy [ 41 ] or power-limited spectroscopic studies of e.g. biological systems in water [ 42 ]. In the past decade there has been increasing interest in utilizing the extreme scalability of the energy per THz pulse in compact linear accelerator (linac) driven sources. The scientific driver here is research aimed at understanding ultrafast THz driven nonequilibrium dynamics in matter [ 43 ] (figure 5 ). The vision to provide electric fields in the V/Å regime, comparable to the dipole field of an ionic bond, or magnetic fields in the few T regime, commensurate with fields required for alignment of magnetic domains, has led in recent years to considerable technological efforts worldwide [ 44 ].\nZoom In\nStandard image High-resolution image Export PowerPoint slide\nNumerous accelerator-based THz sources are operational worldwide as user facilities. The most common sources are synchrotron infrared beamlines [ 37 ] that are available on many synchrotron storage rings. Although the performance of laser-based sources and sources based on thermal emitters in their typical frequency range, 1–30 THz, has improved tremendously in the past 10 years, infrared synchrotron beamlines are still very competitive for brilliance limited spectroscopic techniques such as infrared microscopy and ultra-broadband infrared near-field microscopy. Some storage rings can be operated in a special operational mode, called low alpha mode, which via shortening the electron bunches to the few picosecond regime employ superradiant emission to achieve substantial increases in spectral power below 1 THz [ 39 ]. In this mode of operation average powers in the few 10 mW regime have been demonstrated and several breakthrough experiments on spectroscopy in correlated materials have been performed (see e.g. [ 45 ]). Other projects have used external lasers to slice or to modulate the electron bunch structure to induce superradiant THz emission [ 46 ]. The first ERL source became operational in 2001 [ 40 ], and these sources provide radiation in a similar frequency range and with significantly more power than can be obtained on a synchrotron. Average powers of the order of 10 W and peak powers in the kW regime have been obtained. This is possible because they are based on the new superconducting radio frequency (SRF) technology that enables the operation of linear accelerators at previously unprecedented duty cycles. There are few operational facilities but the potential of these sources has been demonstrated in a number of experiments [ 42 , 47 ]. There is a much wider use of low-gain free electron lasers. Their pulsed, narrow-band tunable radiation is used in the chemical and life sciences to study the infrared spectrum of dilute systems such as clusters or individual molecules by means of the so called action spectroscopy [ 41 ]. Some facilities use SRF technology and hence provide average powers in the few 10 W to even kW regime. Those focus on specific spectroscopy applications in solid state physics that benefit from high flux such as nearfield microscopy [ 48 ] or studies of samples under extreme conditions e.g. high pressure or high magnetic fields [ 49 ]. The combination of an ERL and a THz FEL provides a particular high power source tunable over a narrow frequency range.\nCurrent and future challenges.\nThe operation of synchrotrons in the low alpha mode degrades the output of the accelerator in the shorter wavelength regions that are required for experiments by a large user community and as a result the allocation of time to this mode of operation is limited. It is possible to make further improvements to the performance of synchrotrons in this spectral region but given the recent advances in the performance of laser based THz spectroscopy sources it is not clear that synchrotron THz sources will remain competitive in the future. A class of linac driven superradiant high-field THz sources is emerging [ 44 ] that, unlike low-alpha synchrotron storage rings and ERLs, aims at generating high THz fields from highly charged electron bunches and these are finding applications in investigations of ultra-fast THz-field driven non-equilibrium dynamics. The emitted pulses are carrier-envelope phase stable and, in principle, the design allows the operation of many different types of radiators in parallel from one electron beam. This has the potential to provide a multitude of THz pulse parameters ranging from single-cycle (transition and diffraction radiators) to multi-cycle (undulators) to extreme narrow bandwidth (corrugated waveguides) [ 44 ]. The obvious advantage of this design over laser-based sources is its inherent scalability with respect to the achievable field and/or repetition rate. Although no operational user facility yet exists, several successful pilot experiments have been performed on test facilities and have established the potential of this type of source for investigating THz driven non-equilibrium dynamics in matter in a completely new field regime, one recent example being THz selective control of surface chemistry [ 50 ]. The record THz fields have so far have been obtained at large linear accelerators and at relatively low repetition rates [ 51 ] limiting the application to a few demonstration experiments [ 50 ]. A general challenge for time-resolved experiments at accelerator-based THz sources like FELs or superradiant linac-based sources, remains the synchronization to external laser systems which is currently limited to the few picosecond regime.\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges.\nThere has recently been a proposal for a novel variable pulse length storage ring concept [ 52 ] which if successful would make it possible to generate THz pulses using the low alpha mode on a synchrotron while preserving the beam properties for the typical XUV and x-ray applications. This would result in a significant increase in the available beamtime on synchrotrons for applications in the low THz frequency range. In the field of linac-based superradiant high-field THz sources there are more than ten projects that are currently proposed or are being developed worldwide based on the development of compact sources of high-field THz radiation. Sources with linacs of only a few meters in length are proposed or are already being commissioned [ 44 ]. Some projects aim to combine high fields of the order of MV cm−1 with high repetition rates up to the MHz regime. These sources are based on compact quasi-continuous wave SRF linac technology and have demonstrated impressive progress. Since SRF technology is the basis of several large scale projects (European X-FEL, LCLSII or ILC) it is expected that in the long term high repetition rate high-field superradiant THz sources will be made more compact, reliable and cost efficient. It is also expected that advances will be made in addressing the timing problems in synchronising SRF linacs and external lasers. Several schemes have demonstrated sub 10 fs resolution via post mortem correction of the arrival time jitter. Most recently sub 100 fs synchronization has been demonstrated by active feedback of the accelerator itself. A demonstration THz control experiment, achieving sub 30 fs time resolution, recently showed the enormous advantage of the combination of high-field and high repetition rate for driving coherent dynamics in solids. Particularly interesting is the fact that it was also shown that multiple sources can be operated from one electron beam making multi beam user facilities possible [ 53 ]. A first user facility of this type is expected to become operational in 2016 at the HZDR in Germany and several similar projects are being discussed worldwide (e.g. at DESY/Germany, FERMI/Italy, SLAC/USA, SACLA/Japan).\nConcluding remarks.\nThe development of accelerator-based sources of THz radiation has evolved over the past years towards user facilities that provide either unprecedented high average powers, up to the few 10 W and even kW regime, or more recently high peak fields and/or peak fields at high repetition rates up to 10 MV cm−1 and beyond. These sources complement laser-based and other table-top THz sources, which are limited to lower average powers, lower peak fields and lower repetition rates. The applications of such sources have widened from the brilliance-limited THz spectroscopy applications of the early days towards flux-limited experiments and experiments investigating nonlinear dynamics driven by extreme transient THz fields.\n5. Photoconductive devices for THz time-domain spectroscopy\nE Castro-Camus\nCentro de Investigaciones en Optica A.C., Loma del Bosque 115, Lomas del Campestre, Leon, Guanajuato 37150, Mexico\nStandard image High-resolution image Export PowerPoint slide\nCurrent and future challenges.\nThe one most important technological challenge that photoconductive emitters face these days is their cost-effective large scale production viability. Low-temperature GaAs (or InGaAs) is still the most widely used material for photoconductive devices, however its fabrication has two major disadvantages. Firstly, the semiconductor properties are difficult to reproduce, even when grown under the same nominal conditions in the same reactor. Secondly, its growth requires being performed in molecular-beam-epitaxy (MBE) machines, which is an expensive method for large scale production of terahertz devices.\nAlthough some approaches like the incorporation of nanometric gaps could improve significantly the performance of photoconductive detectors and eliminate the need for short-carrier-lifetime materials, their large scale production also requires very high resolution fabrication techniques such as electron beam lithography, which is also unlikely to be implemented for large scales cost-effectively.\nThe development of compact and on-chip THz spectroscopy systems [ 62 ], which promise to expand THz spectroscopy into new applications, will be a driver for the further development of photoconductive THz devices. There will be a continued drive for more compact femtosecond lasers system and THz sources which in turn will stimulate the development of THz devices optimised for these systems.\nOther future applications of THz-TDS in materials analysis and structural biology will require further advances in polarisation resolving THz detectors (see sections 11 and 13 ). The challenge here is to develop detectors with good enough polarisation sensitivity to be used in vibrational circular dichroism spectrometers [ 63 ].\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges.\nOn the material front, ion-implanted [ 64 ], nanoscale [ 58 ], and nanostructured [ 56 ] semiconductors are showing promising results for replacing low-temperature grown materials, and the quality of materials grown by chemical-vapor-deposition, atomic-layer-deposition and other techniques, more economical than MBE, is improving.\nWhile advances in device and antenna design have been demonstrated using techniques such as electron beam lithography [ 59 ], improvements are needed in high-throughput fabrication techniques. Although the use of extreme-UV photolithography is still relatively restricted to complex microcircuit production, this kind of technology is capable of mass production of devices with features in the scale of ~10 nm, which would be ideal for the fabrication of some of structures such as plasmonic nanostructures.\nConcluding remarks.\nTerahertz photoconductive devices have evolved dramatically since their introduction in the 1980s. The bandwidth, power and reliability of these devices improved with the use of novel semiconductor materials and contact structures. The viability of fabricating these devices at industrial scales is an issue still being addressed, but promising solutions can be foreseen in the years to come.\n6. Components for terahertz imaging\nD R S Cumming1, F Simoens2, I Escorcia-Carranza1 and J Grant1\n1 Microsystems Technology Group, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow G12 8LT, UK\n2 CEA-Leti MINATEC, 17 rue des Martyrs, Grenoble, Cedex 9 38054, France\nStandard image High-resolution image Export PowerPoint slide\nCurrent and future challenges.\nMany application areas have emerged for terahertz imaging, and this has motivated a great deal of research in the underpinning technology. The breadth and societal value of the applications is very great, and are briefly summarised as follows:\nStand-off detection of hidden objects and weapons\nNon-invasive medical and dental diagnostics\nDetection of cracks and defects in materials e.g. solar panels, plastics\nNon-destructive rapid fault isolation in IC packages\nDrug discovery and formulation analysis of coatings and cores\nNon-contact imaging for conservation of paintings, manuscripts and artefacts\nMonitoring of crop and plant hydration levels\nThe challenge for imaging system developers is to devise miniature systems suitable for use in the field. These may be handheld devices or, for example, units for use on remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). It will therefore be necessary to produce high power, low cost and small source technologies that do not require cryogenic cooling. Similarly, there will be a requirement for uncooled detectors. Since, as already noted, full system performance accounts for the attributes of sources, system losses and sensor performance the development of sources and detector technologies will advance in tandem.\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges.\nFuture expectations for terahertz imaging systems include video rate imaging (at least 25 fps) at VGA resolution. Further into the future, HD format will be the normal expectation for any imaging system. Image resolution (as opposed to display resolution), noise and dynamic range are all expected to improve. These improvements will rely on advancement in source, detector and optical/system design technology. Specifically, compact, room temperature terahertz sources in the region of 10 mW average power are essential in order to enable stand-off imaging at distances greater than 1 m. Such sources when coupled with a Si CMOS FPA would render a low-cost THz camera (we estimate <US$5 K per unit) that could find wide spread use in applications such as stand-off detection of hidden objects and non-invasive medical (e.g. oncology) and dental diagnostics. For synchronous detection, current developments are aimed at decreasing acquisition times by using multi-channel systems and on employing quasi time domain spectroscopy (QTDS) by replacing the costly femtosecond laser with an inexpensive multimode laser diode. There will also be advances in sophisticated imaging modalities including near field imaging for high resolution imaging and confocal imaging that promises depth information using CW scalar imaging technologies.\nConcluding remarks.\nThe development of imaging systems to meet a range of growing applications for terahertz is presently limited by the available technologies, irrespective of the image system configuration and modality. Whether the intended application entails the development of a microscope, a far-field or near-field imager, or the use of scalar or time-domain techniques, there is a demand for improved source and detector technologies. Work is required to improve every attribute including, but not limited to: source power; terahertz bandwidth; operating temperature; responsivity and NEP; and array size where deployed. Improvements in these basic component measures will lead to imaging systems with improved: frame rate; resolution; dynamic range; stand-off distance; and reduced size and weight. As can be seen from the review data presented here it is likely that semiconductor technologies will play a vital role and in particular we highlight potential advances in semiconductor laser sources and CMOS-based detector technologies. There will also be a need for further advances in passive components based on antenna, lens and metamaterial theory, design and implementation.\n7. Passive THz components\nStepan Lucyszyn1, Makoto Kuwata-Gonokami2 and Kuniaki Konishi2\n1 Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, Exhibition Road, London, SW7 2AZ, UK\n2 Department of Physics, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan\nStatus.\nCoherent time-domain spectroscopy and non-coherent frequency-domain radiometry are two examples of ultra-broadband THz applications. In general, where performance is paramount, quasi-optical front-end implementations are preferred over the use of guided-wave structures because of the need to minimizing material loss contributions. However, the relentless advancements in achieving ever-higher performance sources and detectors are beginning to relax the requirements for passive components in the lower region of the cost-performance application space. Moreover, with the drive to make complete systems smaller, lighter and cheaper, guided-wave structures offer distinct advantages over their quasi-optical counterparts; the former has inherent advantages in terms of providing better isolation, a wider choice of implementation solutions and can be more easily integrated with active devices without the need for optical alignment accuracy. While transmission lines (e.g. microstrip, coplanar waveguide and coplanar strip) represent the obvious solutions for realizing passives on hybrid and monolithic millimetre-wave integrated circuits, in general, they can suffer from high substrate and radiation losses. In addition, their relatively high conduction current densities result in high dissipative (ohmic) losses at terahertz frequencies. As a result, only low quality factor/high attenuation components are possible at room temperature. Usually, to achieve best performance at room temperature, off-chip resonator/filter solutions are needed. Nevertheless, many papers report on the predicted simulated performance of transmission line-based monolithic THz filters; few give measured results. One notable exception is the work by Nagel et al [ 85 ]. Here, a 0.61 THz second-order thin-film microstrip coupled-line band-pass filter is demonstrated. With gold metallisation and benzocyclobutene dielectric layers, on a silicon substrate having an integrated photoconductive switch, the filter exhibits a measured loaded quality factor of ~10 and insertion loss of  −11 dB [ 85 ].\nSurface plasmon waveguides suffer from relatively poor mode conversion efficiency and high attenuation due to ohmic losses. Nevertheless, because of their tight field confinement, near-field enhancement characteristics and ability to overcome diffraction limits, devices based on the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) offer the potential for future SPP-based integrated circuits at THz frequencies.\nThree examples of high-performance guided-wave technologies used at terahertz frequencies are considered; (1) all metal, (2) metal-dielectric and (3) all dielectric. In general, since dielectric losses can be much lower than those associated with normal room-temperature conductors, lower loss/high quality factor passives can be realized by minimizing conduction current densities and ideally avoiding the use of metals altogether. All three relatively low loss waveguide technologies have been used to demonstrate key components (e.g. power couplers and resonators, used in high performance impedance matching networks, filters and antennas). (1) Metal-pipe waveguides have historically been around for over a century. However, it is only since 2016 that international standards were agreed for operating above 0.1 THz; the IEEE P1785 Working Group proposed standards up to 5 THz [ 86 ]. This recognises the growing importance of this guided-wave medium for industrial applications. Monolithic forms of hollow (air-filled) metal-pipe rectangular waveguide technologies have been around since the early 1990s, first introduced by JPL/Caltech for silicon integration with active devices. Since then there has been a raft of technologies that have moved ever higher in frequency and/or with lower manufacturing costs. Without introducing additional functionality but still maintaining high performance, the University of Birmingham (UK) is currently replacing expensive bulk micromachining of silicon by surface micromachining of SU-8 photoresist sacrificial building materials, recently demonstrating split-block waveguides from 0.5 to 0.75 THz, with integrated 3rd order band-pass filters. This idea follows on from a similar 'snap-together' technology introduced by the UK's EPSRC-funded Terahertz Integrated Technology Initiative (TINTIN) research programme (a collaboration between the Universities of Bath, Reading, Nottingham and Leeds). In 2006, TINTIN demonstrated slotted H-plane sectoral horn antennas at 1.6 THz. (2) Oversized dielectric-lined metal-pipe rectangular and circular waveguides operating with a quasi-single mode of propagation were first introduced in 1963 and subsequently demonstrated losses as low as 0.0037 dB m−1 at 150 GHz with ~10 wavelength diameter structures lined with a low-loss dielectric and below 1 dB m−1 above ca. 0.3 THz with ~20 wavelength diameter structures lined with a high-loss dielectric. More recently, a silver-coated PTFE (Teflon™) circular waveguide has been demonstrated, having a measured transmission loss of ~20 dB m−1 across the ca. 1.0–1.6 THz frequency range [ 87 ]. (3) Rectangular dielectric waveguide components avoid skin-effect related losses altogether, but still suffer from poor isolation. To improve field confinement, photonic crystal waveguides exploit Bragg reflections at the boundaries of dielectric waveguides. An example of a bendable Topas polymer photonic crystal fibre was reported by Nielsen et al, having a loss of <10 dB m−1 at 0.6 THz [ 88 ]; while an photonic crystal resonator that can potentially combine electric field sensing with integrated electronics has been demonstrated in high-resistivity silicon [ 89 ].\nConventional optical components can be used in the THz frequency region. Unfortunately, the performances of THz quasi-optics have not reached the same levels as found at the much shorter optical wavelengths, while associated costs are generally considered higher. As a result, a significant improvement and further development is still needed for ultra-broadband THz applications. For example, a polarizer is an essential component found on many quasi-optical benches and breadboards. High extinction ratio and broadband performance are required. The wire grid polarizer is currently the most popular solution at THz frequencies, but their extinction ratio is inferior and they are more expensive than those in the optical region. Recently, new THz polarizers have been developed using exotic materials such as liquid crystals and carbon nanotubes offering extinction ratios as high as 50 dB, which is comparable to those at shorter wavelengths [ 90 ]. Wave plates represent another important component for polarization control. The quartz crystal is commonly used because it is transparent and has birefringence in the THz frequency region. However, crystal wave plates only work at a single frequency. Recently, Nagai et al proposed and demonstrated a new scheme to realize broadband wave plates, which works from 2.0 to 3.1 THz by utilizing a stacked waveguide structure [ 91 ]. Filters are indispensable components in spectroscopy. Metal mesh filters have been used for a long time at millimetre-wave frequencies, but have recently extending into the sub-millimetre-wave (i.e. THz) region and is considered a class of metamaterials or metasurfaces [ 92 ].\nCurrent and future challenges.\nExisting guided-wave structures and quasi-optical component technologies can achieve reasonable performance at terahertz frequencies, in terms of field confinement, transmission loss and frequency dispersion, over a broad spectral range. However, even with high-end applications, size, mass and cost may still pose serious challenges. Moreover, for ubiquitous applications, the cost of achieving even moderate performance must be addressed in its passive components and associated subsystems. This becomes even harder to address when component tuneability and subsystem reconfigureability (found at microwave and millimetre-wave frequencies) is required in future multifunctional systems.\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges.\nIn the lower region of the cost-performance application space, with voxel sizes heading towards 10 microns, additive manufacturing technologies that include 3D printing (e.g. 3D printed plastic structures with optional gold-copper surface deposition) are moving into the terahertz band. In the upper region of the performance-cost application space, traditional micromachining and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies can increase performance and provide additional functionality, respectively. Tuneable terahertz components would otherwise be difficult to realize within an integrated environment, as the introduction of mechanical tuning mechanisms generally increases both losses and the size of the overall subsystem. Sandia National Laboratories in the U.S. recently reported a 3 THz meandered metal-pipe rectangular waveguide with H-plane horn antenna coupling, manufactured using conventional surface micromachining [ 93 ]. A scanning electron micrograph of this structure is shown in figure 10 . With electroplated gold walls, the measured transmission loss is approximately 1.3  ±  0.1 dB mm−1 or 0.12 dB/wavelength at 3.1 THz.\nZoom In\nStandard image High-resolution image Export PowerPoint slide\nConcluding remarks.\nWith the relentless advances in the performance of active devices and circuits that make up sources, amplifiers, active modulators and detectors, the associated passive components (implemented with either guided-wave structures or free-space quasi-optics) will ultimately limit the overall performance of front-end THz subsystems. Existing and emerging passive component technologies, used to perform vital functions (e.g. within impedance/amplitude/phase matching networks, power couplers, filters, antennas, polarizers and even switches), must find their niche location(s) within the ever-expanding cost-performance application space. Be-spoke passive solutions will be needed to keep pace with developments in active technologies, ideally without the need for cryogenic cooling.\n8. Developments in THz time domain spectroscopy\nMartin Koch\nStandard image High-resolution image Export PowerPoint slide\nNuss and coworkers were the first to further develop this photoconducting antenna emitter-receiver scheme to the point where 2D images of objects a few centimeters in diameter could be accumulated [ 99 ]. Since this first demonstration in 1995, more advanced imaging schemes such as THz tomography, and THz near-field, dark-field and single-pixel imaging have been explored (see [ 100 ] for a review).\nAt this time all terahertz-time-domain spectrometers were free-space spectrometers i.e. the laser beams were guided in air towards the antennas. Hence, moving one antenna to perform angle dependent experiments was cumbersome. In 2000 Picometrix introduced fibre-coupled THz systems [ 101 ], which allows us to freely move THz antennas and therefore provide flexibility and also stability. In 2007 Wilk et al presented a further advancement [ 102 ]. They demonstrated a THz TDS system based on a cost-effective fibre laser operation at 1.55 µm. These lasers are based on low-cost telecom components developed for long-term operation. As antenna material low-temperature grown InGaAs/InAlAs multiple-quantum wells were used. On the basis of this technology a variety of different companies today offer fibre-coupled THz TDS systems with a good signal to noise ratio and a reasonable bandwidth. Consequently, these systems are presently making their first steps towards real world applications and into industrial environments.\nCurrent and future challenges.\nAlthough there has been tremendous progress over the past 25 years, THz TDS systems still need to become faster, smaller, more rugged and less expensive. This would be important for industrial applications, for example for the in-line monitoring of goods during the production process. Companies are willing to pay several thousand Euros for a sensor system but not tens of thousands of Euros, which is the present price level. However, system prices of several thousand Euros would still not impose a mass market. For a real mass market the ideal system would need to cost only a few Euros, would have to have the size of a smart phone, would have to acquire thousands of spectra per second with a bandwidth of many THz and would have to still work after being smashed against a wall. At the moment this is asking too much.\nYet, much progress on achieving these goals has been made in the last 10 years—but not simultaneously concerning all aspects. Regarding the measurement speed, significant progress has been made via new mechanical delay lines, some of which are based on fibre-stretchers. New schemes like asynchronous optical sampling (ASOPS), electronically controlled optical sampling (ECOPS), or optical sampling by laser cavity tuning (OSCAT) (see [ 104 ] for a comparative discussion) allow for the acquisition of THz waveforms without the use of an external delay line, though ASOPS and ECOPS require the use of two femtosecond lasers which enhances and not lowers the price level of a THz TDS system. Also small and portable THz systems have been demonstrated having the size of a laptop computer. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to develop low-cost, fast THz systems, which reliably work in rough environments and over a large temperature range.\nIn addition, imaging systems based on time-domain spectrometers still need to become much faster. Recently, fast imaging systems which use galvanoscanners for deflecting the beam in a raster pattern have been demonstrated. Yet, these systems are far from capturing images at video speed. Faster is an imaging technique, which transforms broadband frequency information of the THz pulses into spatial resolution [ 105 ]. It holds the potential to improve the acquisition speed of images by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the price of a reduced spectral information.\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges.\nIn order to realize the vision above of an ideal mass market system still several years of development are needed. All system components need to drop in price without a reduction in performance. Femtosecond fibre-lasers could be replaced by mode-locked edge emitting and fibre-coupled semiconductor lasers. Potentially, the repetition rate of these lasers can be tuned all-electronically. This would allow for OSCAT based THz spectroscopy systems which employs only one laser and operates without any mechanical delay stage.\nFurthermore, there might still be potential to improve the performance of photoconductive antennas—despite the fact that significant progress has already been made regarding antenna structures and materials. The goal material-wise is a structure with very short carrier lifetime and simultaneously high-carrier mobility. This could potentially be achieved by further optimization of quantum film structures. Besides, the cost-level of fibre-coupled antenna need to become lower, which could be achieved by mass-production. This would allow for parallelization of THz channels, which would improve the imaging speed maintaining full spectral and in-depth information.\nFinally, passive quasi-optical components need be drop in price. Recently devices produced by compression moulding [ 106 ] and by 3D printing [ 107 ] have been demonstrated. In particular 3D printing is presently making rapid advances and holds the potential not only to produce THz optics but also spectrometer housings.\nConcluding remarks.\nDespite the fact that THz time-domain spectroscopy has become a mature field and the technique is used in hundreds of research labs worldwide, there is still significant room for improvement of THz systems. The key could be the further development of mode-locked edge emitting semiconductor lasers and improved photoconductive semiconductor quantum structures. Furthermore, mass production and modern fabrication techniques like 3D printing will have an impact.\n9. Terahertz spectroscopy of semiconductors and semiconductor nanostructures\nCharles A Schmuttenmaer\nStandard image High-resolution image Export PowerPoint slide\nNonlinear studies.\nThis will require more intense THz pulses. Quite a bit of progress has already been made in this direction. For table-top systems, one possibility is to focus the first and second harmonic of the amplified NIR laser and the air plasma that is generated produces a THz pulse [ 116 ]. Another is tilted wavefront generation in lithium niobate [ 25 ] where maximum field strengths greater than 1 MV cm−1 have been achieved.\nTheory.\nOne challenge to be overcome is attaining consensus on which phenomenological model is best and most appropriate for nanostructured semiconductors. This will require very high quality data that covers from 0.1 to 20 THz such that the model that best fits the data will be unambiguous. Advances in computer hardware will allow more rigorous theories and more extensive simulations to be applied routinely. The other required advance is that more theoreticians focus their attention on these systems.\nConcluding remarks.\nTerahertz spectroscopy, both static and time-resolved, will continue to be a leading method for characterization of semiconductors and semiconductor nanostructures. In the future, it will be used to probe increasingly smaller regions and will also be used to drive systems out of equilibrium. One can also envision using photoexcited semiconductors as transient optical components such tunable filters when coupled with metamaterials.\n10. THz microscopy\nStandard image High-resolution image Export PowerPoint slide\nCurrent and future challenges.\nWe envisage four primary objectives for THz microscopy in the coming years: (i) Improve signal-to-noise ratios to broaden the scope of THz microscopy and resolve subtle nanoscale effects. With increased sensitivity, field-resolved detection of scattered pulses could allow the propagation of plasmonic wavepackets to be observed in the time domain. (ii) Introduce cryogenic operation to study local ordering during material phase transitions. Ultrafast near-field measurements at variable temperatures would be of particular interest. Low sample temperatures would carry the added benefit of bringing THz resonances into focus that are typically washed out at room temperature. (iii) Advance from linear to nonlinear THz near-field spectroscopy. High-field, phase-stable THz pulses confined to the apex of a tip could open up a new world of THz coherent control on the nanoscale. Field-resolved detection of the scattered pulses will be essential, as it will allow researchers to trace the nonlinear, carrier-envelope-phase-dependent material response in the time domain and resolve frequencies outside of the excitation bandwidth. (iv) Take THz imaging to the ultimate length scale. Atomic resolution could herald the start of a new era for THz microscopy—that of ultrafast quantum imaging.\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges.\nThe primary challenge currently limiting advances in time-resolved scattering-type THz scanning probe microscopy is the relatively small number of THz photons that carry information from the near field to the far field. Increasing the incident THz pulse energy would immediately improve the signal-to-noise ratio of THz near-field microscopy. Next-generation, ultrastable, high-power, high-repetition-rate THz sources would open new avenues, including nonlinear microscopy and spectroscopy of nanoscale condensed matter and biological systems (see section 11 ). The list of promising candidate technologies currently under development includes mode-locked quantum cascade lasers, which can directly generate phase-stable THz pulses out of their cavities (see section 1 ). Additionally, refined tip preparation and structuring could increase THz coupling efficiencies. Sufficiently sophisticated tip engineering could even enable polarization control, magnetic field sensitivity, or increased evanescent field confinement, and hence enhanced spatial resolution. Improvements to the spatial resolution and sensitivity of THz near-field microscopy are the first steps towards accessing physics on a new, smaller length scale. However, sample stability and preparation must also be optimized. THz near-field experiments are typically performed in ambient conditions, in contrast to cutting edge atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy studies. Dielectric properties on the atomic and molecular scale could ultimately become visible to THz near-field microscopy, but we expect this will only be possible once cryogenic, ultrahigh vacuum operation has been established in conjunction with ultraclean sample preparation. Similarly, the extension to cryogenic conditions would significantly stabilize THz-STM imaging on the smallest length scales. Indeed, the ultimate limits of THz-STM will only be revealed under sufficiently clean experimental conditions.\nConcluding remarks.\nTHz microscopy has recently made the transition from proof-of-concept experiments to an established class of diagnostic techniques with unique capabilities. Subjects range from evanescent fields confined to the surfaces of subwavelength objects to the local material properties of inhomogeneous media and nanoparticles. Future advances in THz generation technology and near-field tip preparation will improve near-field signal-to-noise ratios. This will, in turn, lead to a greater ability to distinguish between small changes in the local dielectric function. Advances in THz generation may ultimately even enable nonlinear THz near-field experiments at the apex of a tip. Meanwhile, cleaner sample conditions could play a key role in improving the spatial resolution of THz microscopy. THz-STM in particular will benefit greatly from ultraclean cryogenic operation under ultrahigh vacuum. It is poised to enter a completely new experimental regime of ultrafast and ultrasmall.\n11. Biological applications of THz technology\nA G Markelz1 and Z D Taylor2\n1 Department of Physics, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY 14620, USA\n2 Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA\nStatus.\nThe application of THz light to biomedical questions is motivated by: (1) strong absorbance by water; (2) predicted resonances in biomolecules; and (3) low possibility of tissue damage by such low energy photons. Research has naturally fallen into two regimes: molecular and systems. Molecular studies use the unique small photon energy excitations that correspond to motions to interrogate biomolecules to provide new information. System studies concern investigating THz imaging of and THz effects on cells and tissues. The two approaches go hand in hand, as the dielectric contrast arises in imaging arises from changes in THz dielectric properties in the tissue because the spatially varying biochemistry associated with disease or tissue damage. We will therefore discuss these two regimes separately. A more thorough and specific discussion on biomedical instrumentation can be found in section 12 . Because of space constraints, many important citations could not be included, some of which can be found in recent reviews [ 126 – 129 ].\nWater's strong absorption of THz light provides a method to precisely monitor tissue water content. Recent measurements find the frequency dependence and magnitude of the absorption depends on salt, protein, and DNA content. In addition THz water absorption depends on protein structural changes such as ligand binding or denaturing. Thus THz could distinguish healthy tissue from tissue with a disease or injury resulting in modifications in protein structure or salt/protein content in cells. The strong absorption of water arises from librational motions of waters and water clusters. Measurements have focused on examining how solutes disrupt the bonding networks, changing both the distribution of cluster sizes and the time scale of local motions [ 130 – 132 ].\nRelatively small biomolecules, such as carbohydrates and pharmaceuticals with ~10–30 atoms have intramolecular vibrations in the mid infrared (MIR). However packaged pharmaceuticals cannot be monitored in the MIR, as the packaging is not transparent. These products use microcrystalline preparations with lattice phonons in the THz range. The lattice vibrations are dependent both on the intermolecular interactions from the crystal order and intramolecular interactions, resulting in spectral lines that are unique for different molecules and for different enantiomers of the same molecule as discussed in section 13 [ 133 , 134 ].\nBy contrast, proteins and DNA molecules have typically 1000s of atoms, and thus (unlike the small biomolecules in section 10 ), proteins have intramolecular vibrations in the THz range. These collective motions are thought to be critical to protein function. The requirement of a critical hydration level to ensure homogeneous samples, results in a large water background to the protein THz absorbance. Bulk water absorption for solution phase measurements can be removed by freezing the sample, however a smooth broad frequency dependent absorption is still observed. The broad absorbance band is due to the large vibrational density of states with many vibrations closely spaced in energy, and the relaxational response of the amino acid side chains and unfrozen waters adjacent to the protein surface. The lack of narrow resonances for unoriented samples prevents use of THz for protein or DNA identification. However, both the absorbance and refractive index change with small ligand binding for proteins and DNA hybridization, and thus THz may be used for biosensing that does not depend on tagging. More recent anisotropic absorption measurements have found narrow resonances to be discussed in section 12 .\nCurrent and future challenges.\nA challenge for THz identification of microcrystalline substances is the identification of artifacts, removal of scattering background and multicomponent analysis for composite materials. Circular dichroism may provide a means to specifically address scattering background. However there is lack of THz CD instrumentation. Multicomponent analysis will be aided by better modeling of the materials, including density functional calculations of the expected absorbance. There has been some improved agreement by several groups, which enables the identification of the specific molecular/lattice motions corresponding to a resonance. These calculations are not yet sufficiently robust and accessible for routine use for database building.\nFor biosensing based on net changes in the broad THz absorbance/refractive index with protein ligand binding and DNA hybridization, there need to be real tests with protein solution with an array of test ligands and concentrations to examine the reliability of THz binding detection. Measurements could be single frequency with high signal to noise and dynamic range with available sources and detectors. Ideally these measurements would be done with the simplest optics, such as a single frequency high power source and a THz camera. Comparisons need to be made to current surface plasmon resonance detection. The THz systems used for these tests need to be standardized, such as current commercial systems, with performance specifications for multiple lab comparison.\nIt has been demonstrated that anisotropic THz absorbance for aligned protein samples addresses in the relaxational background and large vibrational density of states challenges to measuring intramolecular protein vibrations. Using linear dichroism measurements on protein crystals, distinct narrow resonances unique to both the protein and protein binding state have been observed [ 135 ]. This is very exciting. Protein crystals provided the fully hydrated and aligned protein samples, but in the future it would be ideal that alignment could be achieved without crystals. The ability to measure the intramolecular vibrations is a necessary tool to resolve the ongoing argument of their role in biological function. The development of more sophisticated polarimetry measurements may lead to sufficient isolation of specific motions that protein identification via terahertz optical resonances can be achieved. The chief ongoing challenge for these measurements is accurate modeling of the anisotropic terahertz absorbance for proteins. In addition the interpretation of the resonant bands will be a challenge, as these consist not of single vibrations, but sets of vibrations with the same polarization dependence.\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges.\nInstrumentation has advanced considerably over the last 20 years. Aqueous solution measurements require high dynamic range measurements, often achieved using high power sources. At this time one can attain single frequency high power THz sources, with examples found in section 1 . However tunable high power sources are still not available for the bench top.\nPolarimetric measurements can enhance unique spectral resonances for possible identification of biomolecules as well as their specific dynamics. Tools for polarization control and detection are limited at this time, in particular the mating of polarimetry with near field measurements necessary for small samples or high resolution. Ideally a system would have polarization modulation at higher frequencies that currently accessible using current methods of mechanical polarizer spinning. Polarization modulation of a broadband source, or of a frequency tunable source would be necessary and ideally incorporated into microscopy systems such as those mentioned in section 10 . Photo-controlled metamaterials with polarization control have been demonstrated, but have limited bandwidth and therefore limited utility for spectroscopy. The most promising methods are those that modulate the output polarization of the terahertz generator either by initial pulse shaping or relative phase delay for the mixing pulses, or electrode switching for current transient generation, some of which are discussed in section 5 . Efficient methods such as simultaneous measurement of both transmitted polarizations [ 136 ]. One of the chief issues with metamaterials development for polarization control is their limited bandwidth [ 137 ].\nMolecular modeling focused on terahertz dielectric response of biomaterials is one of the chief challenges to progress. There has been considerable advancement for molecular crystals, but water and proteins remain difficult to model and predict/interpret terahertz spectra. The absolute broadband absorbance has been measured for protein solutions as a function of concentration and binding, but only qualitative modeling has been pursued. This could readily be pursued and would be a necessary first step towards identifying the narrow band resonances in the anisotropic THz data for aligned proteins.\nConcluding remarks.\nImmediately after the development of THz time domain spectroscopy there was a great rush to make startling claims about THz biomedical capabilities, with the unfortunate result that some deeply flawed results were published. These problematic studies have caused skepticism within the biomedical community. This skepticism is compounded with a natural mistrust of technology that is not familiar. This has meant that the necessary communication and collaboration between optical engineers and physicists with biologist and medical doctors has been limited. Nevertheless the collaborations that have formed contribute to an increasing number of THz studies published in primarily biological journals. An international consortia that includes biomedical researchers is needed to define specific targets of inquiry to take the field to the next level.\n12. Medical applications\nStandard image High-resolution image Export PowerPoint slide\nCurrent and future challenges.\nTwo areas where terahertz imaging showed lots of early promise but has not taken off is in dermatology and dentistry and the reasons for both are similar. Time domain systems use ultrafast, femtosecond lasers for both generation and detection of terahertz radiation, and although there are a myriad of lasers from 'conventional' titanium sapphire to fibre based lasers, they remain the most expensive individual component of any system. The laser itself is well above the equipment price point typical for the disciplines of dermatology and dentistry. For clinical acceptance of any new technology the information provided has to be not only of clinical use and unique information, but also provide value for money, i.e. provide healthcare cost savings over current methods. Mass production of devices could drive down the cost as discussed in section 8 . The challenges for terahertz medical imaging could be classified into two areas, scientific and technological. The scientific challenge is to provide unique information not available from other numerous imaging techniques available to the clinician; what does the terahertz image tell you about the tissue pathology not evident otherwise. Is this information sufficiently (statistically significant) different to surrounding tissue to provide the levels of sensitivity and specificity required in clinical decision making? To achieve statistical significance and level of efficacy sufficient for acceptance by regulatory bodies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires large multicentre clinical trials and a significant financial investment. Water absorption limits the depth of tissue that may be imaged using terahertz to a few hundred microns in skin and up to a centimetre is tissue with more fat content like breast. However, 85% of cancers originate in the epithelial tissues that form the external and internal surface structures of the body and it is often cells in these thin layers that become malignant and hence are accessible with suitable technology, e.g. endoscopes. The technological challenge is to provide this information quickly, ideally in real time, in a flexible, low cost medical device. To achieve these requirements even cheaper and compact laser systems are required, fast scanning or alternative pixel array like CMOS cameras. Further consideration is required on how to analyse and present imaging or diagnostic information that is acceptable to the clinical community.\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges.\nTo help verify that terahertz is providing unique information about tissue pathology the terahertz clinical data collected needs to be understood using mathematical models. Terahertz spectra of tissues with high water content e.g. skin, follow a similar trend as that for pure water but the absorption is not as high. If tissue homogeneity is assumed, the spectra can be modelled using double Debye theory [ 144 ]. Tissues with a high adipose (fat) content appear different and do not follow double Debye theory and it needs to be modified by manipulation and adding an extra term [ 145 ]. Modelling is further complicated when tissue structure is taken into account and Taylor et al have done this effectively using Bruggeman effective media theory [ 146 ]. Further development of these models and fitting to a variety of clinical data, with the addition of inverse modelling to help develop technology will aid better understanding of how terahertz interacts with tissues, which is vital to future development of the technology. Another advance is to enhance terahertz biomedical imaging by introducing exogenous contrast agents, such as gold nanoparticles, which have been shown to improve contrast. Oh and Son found that the terahertz reflection signal increased by 20% in the cancer cells with gold nanoparticles upon their irradiation with an infrared (IR) laser, due to a rise in the temperature of local water [ 147 ]. With suitable specific binding proteins placed on the surface of the nanoparticles they could be preferentially taken up by cancers in vivo and with a suitable excitation and imaging set-up this could lead to improved differentiation between tumour and normal tissues using terahertz.\nThe greatest contrast seen with time domain systems, for example, between cancer and normal tissue occurs below 1 THz and peaks around 500 GHz [ 148 ], hence a time-domain system an expensive ultrafast laser may not be required for medical applications. Taylor et al have used a 525 GHz reflection imaging system to image full and partial thickness burns in an in vivo animal model which showed different regions of the wound [ 149 ]. Further work is needed to confirm these findings. There are continual developments in the field of quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) described in detail in section 1 . One exciting development is Terahertz imaging through self-mixing in a QCL [ 150 ] and this is now being investigated as a method to image biological samples. Despite there still being the need for cryogenic cooling this technique may well overcome some of the technical challenges faced using time domain systems.\nConcluding remarks.\nThere remains are a number of potential advantages in the application of terahertz technology to medical imaging. The low photon energy means that the radiation is non-ionising; there is negligible scattering in tissues, the high sensitivity to water content provides contrast between diseased states; time-domain systems can provide quasi 3D information and the broad frequency range the opportunity to investigate a range of diagnostic parameters. Although there are a number of alternative well established clinical imaging techniques and those translating from the research laboratory to the clinic there remains a number of interesting clinical problems where terahertz could be applied and aid clinical decision making, for example, there is a need to improve the surgical removal of cancer by accurately locating tumour margins, especially in the case where conservation of normal tissue is essential, as in breast or brain surgery. Several challenges remain from understanding contrast to the engineering of suitable devices but terahertz technology is still relatively young and although there have been no major commercial breakthroughs in the field of terahertz medical application to date; niche applications will likely evolve.\n13. Non-destructive testing and molecular spectroscopy\nJ Axel Zeitler1, Juraj Sibik1 and Timothy M Korter2\n1 Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge, Philippa Fawcett Drive, Cambridge CB3 0AS, UK\n2 Department of Chemistry, Syracuse University, 1-014 Center for Science and Technology, Syracuse, NY 13244-4100, USA\nStatus.\nTerahertz radiation used in non-destructive testing (NDT) is an attractive technology due to its penetrative power through a number of highly relevant materials in industry and science, including semiconductors, polymers, ceramics and composites thereof. The presence of spectral signatures at terahertz frequencies also makes the technique very powerful because it combines high penetrative power with excellent contrast and the ability to resolve subtle differences in composition of a range of dielectric media. It is non-ionising, can be performed as a non-contact technique, and yields relatively high spatial resolution on the order of hundreds of micrometres in the far-field.\nCurrently, the majority of imaging is performed using pulsed technology (see section 8 ). The measurement principle is similar to ultrasound imaging in that, typically, a short pulse of radiation probes the internal structure of a semi-transparent material, and the time-delay of reflections are recorded originating from changes in refractive index within the sample of interest, in turn allowing to resolve its internal structure [ 151 ]. Measurements can be performed in either reflection or transmission geometry (figure 19 ).\nZoom In\nStandard image High-resolution image Export PowerPoint slide\nIn addition to its high penetrative power, terahertz radiation is at resonance with phonon vibrations in inorganic and organic molecular crystals and low-frequency internal motions and hydrogen bonds in general (see also section 11 ). Since Grischkowsky in the late 1980s [ 98 ] it has been demonstrated that, by probing the hydrogen bonding networks and the phonon modes in molecular solids, the technique has a very high sensitivity to their supramolecular structure and that terahertz spectroscopy is a complementary technology to conventional far-infrared spectroscopy. In liquids the high frequency wing of the dielectric loss peaks observed at gigahertz frequencies can be detected using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). In amorphous solids the vibrational density of states dominates the terahertz spectral range with a small but significant contribution due to fast dielectric relaxation processes. The refractive index in amorphous solids is therefore typically different to that of its crystalline counterparts. In THz-TDS both amplitude and phase of the electric field are measured rather than just intensity. This allows for direct measurement of the complex refractive index and thus THz-TDS can be used as a low energy extension of vibrational spectroscopy or a high frequency extension of dielectric spectroscopy. Furthermore, conducting materials reflect terahertz radiation very strongly, so exhibit excellent contrast.\nMolecular spectroscopy at terahertz frequencies on its own, and in the context of imaging, is increasingly popular in the investigation of molecular interaction in a range of materials [ 152 ]. One of the key advances in its establishment was developing ways to assign vibrational modes observed at terahertz frequencies, including using computational techniques such as periodic density functional theory (DFT). There is a very productive synergistic relationship between the development of new DFT techniques that include more accurate levels of theory regarding the weak intermolecular forces and the experimental terahertz studies to validate the theoretical results [ 153 ]. THz-TDS has been demonstrated for a variety of sample materials from non-destructive testing applications in the electronics, pharmaceutical, catalysis, food, composite materials, art and conservation science and automotive industries amongst others [ 154 ].\nCurrent and future challenges.\nWhile it is possible to extract structural information at depth and perform tomography experiments it is not yet straightforward to extract spectral information at a depth of sufficient fidelity or spatial resolution to fully realise the technique's potential. To maximise spatial resolution the radiation is typically delivered as a focused beam to the surface of an object. Even without trying to resolve the spectral signature of the material at depth it is not routinely possible to quantitatively account for the scattering processes that occur further below the surface deep inside the sample and hence the spatial resolution and accuracy of the reconstructed internal structure is deteriorating rapidly with increasing depth. Even for the most simple measurement configuration, THz-TDS in transmission, scattering losses are not trivial to account for quantitatively [ 155 ]. Furthermore, internal structure is most commonly extracted based on the plane wave approximation, which by definition does not account for beam convergence. Owing to the relatively low power of the present terahertz emitters most setups do not direct the terahertz beam at an angle of normal incidence to the surface; though imaging at normal angle would greatly facilitate the image reconstruction. However, such an imaging setup requires a beamsplitter and, due to the associated reflection losses, is not commonly implemented.\nMeasurement of relatively thin structures such as polymeric coating thickness is one of the most common applications of the technique, e.g. pharmaceutical film coatings. Here, the advantage is that the film structures are relatively thin, rendering scattering and angle dependence relatively minor problems. Comparatively little is known regarding the optical properties of coating layers that are thin compared to the wavelength of the terahertz pulse. It is unestablished how the optical properties of materials change with temperature or other process conditions, which is crucial in real-time industrial measurements for process control or direct feedback.\nIn structural imaging experiments, signal processing and the removal of noise from the data to enhance the contrast of the internal structure of an object is widely used. Deconvolution and filtering of the signal in the frequency domain is routine and promising results have been obtained using wavelet denoising. Synthetic aperture imaging has been demonstrated at terahertz frequencies and potentially very powerful in addressing challenges in the depth resolved imaging area [ 156 ]. However, there is significant need for further development of more powerful signal processing routines to allow for real-time analysis of terahertz time-domain data.\nImaging systems are too slow for in-line inspection and thus far in-line sensing at industrial process scale has only been demonstrated for select applications. To compete with other structural imaging techniques, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), terahertz imaging systems will need to increase their acquisition speed by 2–3 orders of magnitude.\nThe signal advantage of high power sources such as terahertz quantum cascade lasers (>2 THz) or electronic sources (<1 THz) is compromised by the relatively low sensitivity in detection (or the requirement of cryogenically cooled detectors) compared to low power photoconductive antenna technology. Furthermore, terahertz quantum cascade lasers only operate at cryogenic temperatures.\nGiven its relatively long wavelength compared to optical techniques the spatial resolution for far-field imaging is limited to about 200 µm. While this is more than sufficient for a range of NDT applications there are a number of applications, such as imaging of microstructures in ceramics or electronics, which need a higher spatial resolution. Near-field imaging has been demonstrated by a number of groups but present systems are still slow and difficult to align and maintain for routine inspection of samples [ 157 ]. The status of near field imaging systems is discussed more in section 10 .\nA challenge for terahertz technology is the limited penetration range of terahertz radiation through atmosphere chiefly due to the high absorption that originates from the rotational transitions in water. Consequently, the terahertz pulses have to be generated closely to the object (mm distance between sensor and object) or the atmosphere needs to be purged with a gas such as dry air or nitrogen. There is a lack of wave-guiding technology that provides sufficiently low losses or spectral bandwidth over distances in excess of a few centimetres.\nIn terms of computational techniques that are used to interpret spectral signatures at terahertz features, the assignment of such vibrational modes is still based on numerical calculations that utilise finely tuned semi-empirical corrections to the DFT energies rather than robust and universal methods that can be employed with all parameters specified a priori. This dependence of user tuneable parameters limits the predictive ability of current simulations.\nCompeting technologies are ultrasound, x-ray imaging, OCT, millimetre imaging, infrared thermography. While the potential of terahertz NDT is immense compared to these techniques, the reliability, capital and operative costs are not yet competitive. Careful investigation of the potential synergies that could be unlocked by combining terahertz imaging and spectroscopy with competing NDT modalities is also necessary.\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges.\nOne advance needed is that of higher power terahertz sources to increase penetration depth and be able to analyse the internal structure of larger objects, e.g. whole catalytic converters. These should be compact and operational at room temperature with a well-defined beam profile. Ideally, they should be pulsed broadband sources covering frequencies of 0.2 to at least 3 THz (up to 10 THz highly desirable for spectroscopic applications), to make use of the spectral information whilst maintaining the high penetrative power of terahertz radiation below 3 THz. Together with such sources comes the need for efficient waveguide technology to direct efficiently the terahertz beam to the location of interest and, from a safety point-of-view, to avoid unnecessary exposure to the operator until safe levels are established for high power terahertz radiation.\nTo increase depth resolution and spectral bandwidth shorter pulse duration or interferometry imaging techniques need to be developed. Using shorter pulses it is possible to resolve thinner coating structures in applications where terahertz imaging could achieve far better contrast compared to other techniques, e.g. paint coating layers.\nTo speed up the imaging process there is a pressing need for array detectors that can be used for time-domain measurements. Furthermore, the availability of high quality lenses and other passive optical components (as described in the section 7 ) is essential and active components for beam steering and other applications highly desirable.\nCurrently, system reliability is insufficient. The drift in signal power and signal-to-noise are significant and there is no available technology that can ensure signal stability at the level of e.g. ultrasound imaging or OCT setups.\nThere remains a significant gap in understanding of the dynamics of molecular structure at terahertz frequencies. Development of new density functionals is needed that incorporate into their construction the ability to capture weak long range forces that drive solid state structure and dynamics. In contrast to the relative maturity in treating crystalline solids, the computational tools for understanding amorphous solids require extensive advances for practical use.\nTo achieve distortion free tomographic imaging of objects on length scales of centimetres more advanced reconstruction algorithms need to be developed that explicitly take into account diffraction effects and different beam shapes.\nThere is active development in the areas of non-linear spectroscopy and imaging [ 160 ], 2D spectroscopy experiments [ 158 ] and polarisation dependent measurements [ 159 ]. These different approaches could potentially lead to new NDT methodologies by opening up new contrast mechanisms.\nConcluding remarks.\nThe field of NDT and molecular spectroscopy applications at terahertz frequencies has grown rapidly over the past decade and is showing signs of establishing itself as a well-recognised measurement technique. Innovative applications of using terahertz radiation in this context are being developed and are starting to be implemented in real-world situations.\n14. THz technology—the rocket road to space\nB Ellison1, S Rea1 and P Goldsmith2\n1 Millimetre Wave Technology Group, STFC, RAL Space, OX11 0QX, UK\n2 Jet Propulsion Laboratory, M/S 180-703, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109, USA\nStatus.\nWhen located above the attenuating effects of the Earth's atmosphere (figure 20 ), spaceborne terahertz (THz) payload technology gains an unobstructed view of the cold, dark regions of the interstellar medium and the wider universe. It also supports in situ exploration of our solar system, including the planets and near Earth objects (NEOs), e.g. comets, and is used extensively to measure important constituents of the Earth's upper atmosphere that strongly influence climate meteorology and change.\nZoom In\nStandard image High-resolution image Export PowerPoint slide\nFabrication of sensors becomes increasingly challenging at higher frequencies due to the need to minimise parasitic effects that curtail frequency response and limit usable bandwidth. This requires further device miniaturisation and greater consideration of material properties that limit sensor response and sensitivity, e.g. carrier velocity, dielectric effects and resistive losses. For Earth observation, evolution of semiconductor detector technology is required to allow use at supra-THz (\n1 THz) frequencies and relevant developments are described in section 16 . For astronomy, similar evolution of superconducting detectors is necessary, including higher ambient temperature operation.\nSensor packaging influences coupling to the incident signal and the pixel count of imaging arrays. It also impacts payload mass and volume and is particularly important with regard to THz heterodyne systems where the provision of local oscillator power is technically demanding and integration with the mixer detector is highly desirable. Mechanical fabrication technologies therefore need advancement to realise minute structures required to both house high-frequency sensors and provide optimum signal matching and some new techniques are considered in section 7 . System integration is essential for future payloads, particularly where multiple frequency and or focal plane array operation is required and including future telecommunication applications as discussed in detail in section 17 . Complex, diffraction limited quasi-optical trains comprising high tolerance free-space components, e.g. mirrors, frequency selective surfaces, polarisers, and precision calibration mechanisms, must be realised in a compact form that minimises mass and volume. Additionally, signal-processing systems must be enhanced to allow increased digital sampling speed and data processing with reduced power consumption and requires, for example, the development of radiation tolerant complementary metal-oxide semiconductor application specific integrated circuits.\nThe above present considerable challenges to device and system developers. They will require enhanced electromagnetic and mechanical software modelling methodologies that are complemented by micro-miniature fabrication techniques that enable the realisation of state-of-the-art payload technology.\nConcluding remarks.\nDeployment of THz technology in space has gained considerable heritage through scientific applications that include astronomy and Earth observation. Excellent potential also exists for increased spaceborne commercial exploitation in support of, for example, weather monitoring and future ultra-high frequency telecommunications. Next generation instrumentation must, however, be compliant with small satellite payload platforms and exhibit low mass, minimal volume, and efficient power consumption. Evolution of sensors to higher frequencies with greater sensitivity and improved imaging capability together with enhanced digital signal processing is also necessary. These technical enhancements present considerable challenges and require developments in, for example, detector materials, circuit miniaturisation, advanced machining, lightweight composites, and improved cooling technologies. Addressing these challenges will allow a wider exploitation of the THz domain from space and important advancements are correspondingly being made within relevant organisations world-wide. Spaceborne THz technology will continue to flourish during coming decades providing both scientific and commercial return.\n15. Terahertz components and systems for defence and security imaging\nKen B Cooper1 and Roger Appleby2\n1 Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA\n2 Innovasec Ltd, 212b West Malvern Road, Malvern, Worcs, WR14 4BA, UK\nStatus.\nRF systems operating above 150 GHz are poised to find a sustained niche in security applications, with two tipping points recently emerging. First are new standoff body-scanning imaging approaches for checkpoint screening, loss prevention, customs, and intelligence gathering. From distances of many meters, covert crowd-screening is possible that, owing to trade-offs between resolution and aperture size, cannot be accomplished using the longer wavelength millimetre-wave portal systems widely used in aviation security. The Thruvision series of passive imagers from Digital Barriers is the most prominent >150 GHz system commercially available [ 171 ]. Another passive imager is that of Asquella, based on cooled microbolometers [ 172 ] originally developed at VTT and NIST. Three imagers that operate at either 340 or 680 GHz, which are noteworthy for their relative maturity amongst many active research groups, are JPL's imaging radar (figure 22(a) ) [ 173 ], the combination radar  +  passive imager under development by the European concealed object stand-off real-time imaging for security (CONSORTIS) team [ 174 ], and the THz-Videocam system from Germany [ 175 ] (figure 22(b) ). The second development promising wider applicability of THz security technology is the demonstration of InP integrated circuits that open frequency bands up to 850 GHz for use in radar, navigation, and communication. For example, JPL has demonstrated equivalent performance of the system of figure 22(a) with its front-end driven by 340 GHz MMICs developed by Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems [ 176 ] under the DARPA THz Electronics Program. Another near-term application currently receiving intense attention is using the 230 GHz band for imaging through degraded atmospheric environments, such as landing helicopters in brown-outs or targeting from aircraft through low-altitude clouds [ 177 ]. In general, THz frequencies are useful in security applications for three reasons:\n1.  \nMiniaturization of RF hardware: components scale with wavelength, leading to wider deployment opportunities—for example, wearable devices, small aircraft, and small satellites (e.g. see section 14 ). The ~100 µm length scale of THz devices is also commensurate with lithographic manufacturing techniques (e.g. see section 7 ), leading to novel THz uses of micro-coax, MEMs devices, artificial dielectrics, and micro-lens antenna arrays.\n2.  \nHigh information content: the huge bandwidths available at THz frequencies (tens of GHz) improves spatial resolution of radar and imaging systems, and enables communication with high data rates (also see section 17 ).\n3.  \nUnique phenomenology: certain detection capabilities are impossible in any other electromagnetic band, such as molecular fingerprinting via rotational spectroscopy, high-resolution penetration in optically opaque conditions (as described in the section 13 ), micro-Doppler sensing with simultaneous range resolution, and high sensitivity to scattering from submillimetre scale particles (e.g. micrometeoroids and orbital debris fields that threaten satellites).\nZoom In\nStandard image High-resolution image Export PowerPoint slide\nConcluding remarks.\nWe have presented the trends and future challenges in THz security systems using the framework of standoff imaging systems. Whereas solid state transistors will likely replace Schottky diodes as sources and receivers in active systems, for passive systems above 150 GHz the large number of receivers (1000s) required to achieve reasonable contrast mean that bolometer arrays continue to be critical, until packaging makes MMICs competitive. For both active and passive systems we therefore predict, with moderate confidence, that integrated circuit and packaging technologies are the highest priority research challenges to achieve lower costs and more widely applicable capabilities. But whatever the route THz technology development takes, we are much more certain that THz systems generally can open sensing modalities simply not possible in any other electromagnetic band.\n16. Semiconductor device based THz detection\nD Pardo1, P G Huggard1 and V Krozer2\n1 Millimeter Wave Technology Group, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Didcot OX11 0QX, UK\n2 Goethe-Leibniz Terahertz Center, Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main, 60323 Frankfurt am Main, Germany\nStatus.\nWe discuss two terminal, majority carrier, semiconductor devices, primarily based on Schottky barriers with GaAs and InGaAs, which underpin a large part of measurement technology at frequencies from below 100 GHz to above 1 THz. Originally configured as point contact devices for frequency multiplication and heterodyne detection [ 182 ], this approach has now been supplanted by the more reproducible and reliable airbridged planar technology [ 183 ]. Variations of such devices are critical for frequency multiplication to generate local oscillator (LO) signals for heterodyne detectors for radio astronomy [ 184 ], for remote sensing of the Earth's atmosphere [ 185 ] and for laboratory test and measurement instruments [ 186 ]. The same approach is also used for the transmit elements in radars and communication systems. As heterodyne mixer detectors, Schottky diodes dominate in nearly all the above fields, the exception being radio astronomy. They offer a low conversion loss, typically better than 10 dB, room temperature operation and intermediate frequency (IF) bandwidths extending to tens of GHz. Applications are indicated in sections 14 , 15 and 17 . This section also complements the discussions in sections 5 and 6 .\nDevice topologies range from single anode devices used in direct detectors, through anti-parallel pairs in sub-harmonic mixers (figure 24 ) to the multiple anode series and anti-series configurations needed for multipliers handling high input powers. Traditionally, devices are diced and soldered to gold on quartz microstrip filters, which are then embedded in single mode waveguide cavities. This approach has evolved to using self-supporting membranes for THz frequencies and high thermal conductivity substrates for high power multipliers. The combination of microstrip and waveguide cavity achieves the required impedance matching over wide instantaneous bandwidths, at RF, LO and IF for mixers. As these are square-law devices, Schottky diodes also function well as video detectors, and either waveguide or quasi-optical mounts can be used for fast, broadband room temperature detectors with a wide dynamic range [ 187 ].\nZoom In\nStandard image High-resolution image Export PowerPoint slide\nTo improve individual detector performance, the challenge is to design simultaneously at several frequencies, including the passive waveguide and microstrip with the electrically nonlinear Schottky device, and the antenna structure in the case of a quasi-optical mount. Mutiple frequency design is needed to optimise impedance matching and, for multipliers, to minimise power generation at unwanted frequencies. Imaging and future Earth observation instrumentation requires arrays of detectors, so efficient methods of distributing the LO signal to each pixel are needed: this will also benefit radio-astronomy. Generating a frequency multiplied LO with increased efficiency and lower component count is also required: the current cascading of several x2 and/or 3x multiplication stages to reach THz frequencies is cumbersome and inefficient, with the packaging overwhelmingly dominating the device volume: figure 24 . Improved multiplier design tools are also needed: the challenges are as for mixers, with the added complexity of thermal dissipation and the thermal nonlinearity in the Schottky device(s). As performance decreases at elevated temperatures, methods of overcoming the relatively poor thermal conductivity of GaAs are needed. Device area also drops with increasing frequency, to minimise parasitic shunt capacitance, so methods of applying several devices in parallel and combining their outputs to achieve higher power are required.\nThe challenge of integration of Schottky devices with photodiodes or high frequency transistors also needs addressing, for example to produce mixers with photonic local oscillator generation and integrated IF amplifiers respectively. Composite circuits are currently assembled from discrete devices produced in different laboratories, from dedicated wafers grown and processed by optimised methods in each case. Very little effort has been invested in growing and processing to demonstrate more than one technology on the same chip.\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges.\nImproved design tools, changes in device topology and new materials will be needed so that the performance of Schottky technology improves at frequencies close to and above 1 THz and that the cost of anticipated volume applications, for example in short range communications, at frequencies up to a few hundred GHz, drops.\nImproved design techniques will require the application of Monte Carlo and hydrodynamic models, in parallel with the conventionally used HFSS/CST and ADS modelling combination. Accurate knowledge of the complex dielectric properties of metals, dielectrics and doped semiconductors at THz frequencies will be needed as inputs to the models. It is also assumed that the application of thermal modelling will be routine. Instead of modelling individual Schottky devices driving a set of impedance matched ports, as done now, the interaction with immediately adjacent devices will be included. Collectively, this means that much more computing power will be needed for the design process.\nAs mentioned above, the current approach of connecting devices by single mode waveguide is inefficient, but it does offer the advantage that the inevitable loss in the microstrip to waveguide to microstrip transitions offers some isolation and reduces the standing waves that modulate the devices' performance with frequency. A new approach to connecting a series of Schottky devices in a single block, with intermediate microstrip components offering isolation via circulation or attenuation should be used.\nNew materials and processing approaches will be needed: at low frequencies GaN has potential and more generally composite semiconductors will provide the necessary high thermal conductivity path that is needed from the Schottky anode. For comparison, the thermal conductivities of Si and AlN are roughly three times that of GaAs, and that of CVD diamond is an order of magnitude higher again. For integration, dedicated wafer growth will include the required layers to permit definition of optical waveguides, photodiodes and transistors adjacent to the Schottky device, and process development will permit contact deposition and annealing without adverse effects on other devices.\nConcluding remarks.\nSchottky devices, made from GaAs and its alloys, will continue to be the most widely applied terahertz detector technology, due to their critical role in test equipment and scientific instrumentation. This includes mixers, with associated frequency multipliers for LO provision, and power detectors. For specific video detection applications, CMOS transistor detectors may be employed [ 189 ], but the high initial cost of a wafer run is a barrier to widespread application. High CMOS device impedance restricts the IF bandwidth, making the technology unattractive for mixer applications. However, both direct and mixing functions have been demonstrated in GaAs alloy based heterostructure field effect transistors [ 190 ]. Space limitations prevents discussion of other detector devices, e.g. ternary tunnel diodes [ 191 ].\nInvestment in the parallel application of numerical simulations by high power computers, composite semiconductor growth and ambitious integration projects will deliver a step change in the way GaAs devices perform, will physically shrink interconnects and packaging, and achieve the needed integration with other semiconductor technologies.\nThe authors thank Byron Alderman for his comments.\n17. Status of THz communications\nHaymen Shams1, Martyn Fice1, Cyril Renaud1, Alwyn Seeds1 and Andreas Stöhr2\n1 Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place, London, WC1E 7JE, UK\n2 Department of Optoelectronics, Faculty of Engineering, University of Duisburg-Essen, Lotharstr. 55, 47057 Duisburg, Germany\nStatus.\nWireless data traffic is increasing exponentially, as mobile users increasingly make use of online services. It is expected that global mobile data will grow up to 24.3 Exabytes monthly by 2019 [ 192 ]. This huge increase results from the deployment of broadband networks for fixed and wireless communications, and the evolution of new online services such as video streaming, and cloud-based applications. Therefore, there is need for new wireless technology that supports much higher wireless speeds. Although Wi-Fi is the most popular form of wireless communication, its capacity is still limited with worldwide assigned bandwidth. Wider spectral bands are available at millimetre-wave (mm-wave) frequencies, such as 60 GHz, and 70–95 GHz, while the total allocated bandwidth is less than 7 GHz, which support data rates of 10 Gbps over short distances. For higher capacity wireless data systems, THz communication bands (0.1–10 THz) are being investigated for their much larger available bandwidth, which ranges from a few GHz to over 1 THz. Although optical frequencies can offer even larger bandwidth, the optical beams have very small tolerances in line-of-sight alignments, and two orders of magnitude higher losses due to weather conditions such as fog (200 dB km−1) and scintillation effect, compared to little or no effect for THz waves up to 1 THz [ 193 , 194 ]. This makes photonics-enabled THz wireless a more attractive systems solution.\nSeveral research groups have demonstrated communication links in the W-band (75–95 GHz) and for frequencies over 100 GHz. Real time transmission was reported based on on–off keyed (OOK) modulation using a Schottky barrier diode for direct detection scheme, and polarization multiplexing in a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system for 48 Gbit s−1 dual channel at 300 GHz [ 195 ]. Other THz wireless link demonstrations have been carried out based on offline detection, where the wireless signal is down-converted to intermediate frequency (IF) and digitally processed offline. This scheme improves the receiver sensitivity and the system quality by correcting the transmission impairments using advanced digital signal processing (DSP). Multiple wireless channels at sub-THz frequencies were proposed to use the available spectrum and reduce the bandwidth limitation of the optoelectronic components [ 196 , 197 ]. Recently, a multiband sub-THz system was demonstrated for downlink transmission with an overall downlink channel data rate of 100 Gbits s−1 and uplink rate of 10 Gbit s−1 OOK (figure 26 ) [ 198 ]. Also, researchers from Université de Lille demonstrated a THz wireless communication system operating at a higher carrier frequency of 400 GHz with up to 46 Gbit s−1 OOK by using a THz photo-mixer integrated with a broadband antenna [ 199 ].\nZoom In\nStandard image High-resolution image Export PowerPoint slide\nAnother key component for THz photonic systems is the photomixer, which should offer simultaneously high saturation power, high responsivity, and high bandwidth. Most recent work points towards the use of photodetectors as photomixers, and, in particular, the use of UTC-PDs as they meet most of the key parameters. Further, photonic integration of those InP-based THz photomixers with Si-based low optical transmission loss waveguides is needed for developing electronically steerable antenna arrays which are crucial to achieve the SNR required for spectral efficient THz communications [ 203 ]. Advances in mm-wave electronic subsystems will also be required for practical and cost-effective THz communication systems, especially power amplifiers and phased-array antennas.\nConcluding remarks.\nThe need for bandwidth to support high capacity wireless data transmission is a strong driver for the development of THz communication systems. There are a number of transmission windows in the spectrum below 400 GHz that are well suited to short range and indoor wireless systems.\nThe most important challenges for commercial realisation of this technology are the development of compact and efficient THz sources providing continuous wave output power levels up to 100 mW and the development of compact electronically steerable antenna arrays to minimise wireless link loss.\n18. Metrology for THz technologies\nMira Naftaly1, Nick Ridler1 and Roland Clarke2\n1 Division of Time, Quantum and Electromagnetics, National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, TW11 0LW, UK\n2 School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK\nStatus.\nThe area of terahertz science and applications has been growing roughly exponentially since the invention of time-domain spectroscopy in the early 1990s (see section 8 ), as indicated by the number of scientific publications. However, it is only in the last few years that the field has matured to the degree that metrology and standardisation have gained focused attention, resulting in an increasing number of publications and a book devoted to the subject [ 204 ].\nMeasurements at THz frequencies employ two disparate classes of instrumentation platforms: free-space and waveguide-based. Whereas free-space techniques have evolved from optical spectroscopy by expanding the operational range to longer wavelengths, waveguide-based approaches are an extension of electronic RF measurements to higher frequencies. In a sense, the increasing bandwidth overlap between these technologies represents the continuing shrinkage of the so-called 'THz gap'.\nFree-space and waveguide techniques occupy different and separate spheres of THz applications, in that free-space measurements are employed primarily for material spectroscopy and imaging, whereas waveguide measurements are utilised for device characterization. Although state-of-the-art waveguide-based devices overlap the lower frequency range of free-space instruments, nevertheless the two types of THz measurements remain distinct, divided by both areas of application and experimental methodologies. Their metrological problems and challenges are also different, and for that reason will be discussed separately.\nFree-space THz spectroscopy is mainly accomplished by two types of instruments: Fourier transform spectrometers (FTS) and time-domain spectrometers (TDS). Although both rely on the Fourier transform to derive spectral data, they are in other respects significantly different, operationally and metrologically. The most important distinction is that TDS is a coherent technique, that is to say, it measures directly the time-varying electric field of the THz pulse, yielding both field amplitude and phase; whereas FTS is incoherent, measuring only field intensity. As a direct consequence, TDS provides a straightforward means of determining unambiguously the refractive indices and absorption coefficients of materials studied. In contrast, parameter extraction from FTS data is complicated, requiring specially prepared samples and measurements in both transmission and reflection geometries, and results in large uncertainties. Moreover, TDS systems can achieve (and typically demonstrate) much larger signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range than FTS instruments. For that reason, TDS dominates measurements of optical constants of materials. FTS, on the other hand, is preferentially employed in measurements requiring ultra-wide bandwidth from sub-THz to mid-IR. Complementary to TDS and FTS, non-spectroscopic or narrow-band THz measurements, including imaging, have been performed using a variety of emitter-detector combinations, and are often employed in types of applications where metrological considerations are of secondary importance (see sections 6 and 13 ).\nWaveguide-based THz measurements are predominantly made using heterodyne vector network analyzer (VNA) based systems [ 205 ], whose operational bandwidth and upper frequency limit has been steadily increasing and now extends to THz frequencies. This has been achieved using frequency extender heads that are external to the VNA and that operate using harmonics of the fundamental of a microwave signal source. VNA systems employ coherent detection and enable calibration procedures (i.e. error correction routines) to be applied automatically so that imperfect system hardware is corrected 'in software' without needing to make manual adjustments to the measuring instrument.\nCurrent and future challenges.\nThe most straightforward of metrology issues in free-space THz measurements is the lack of calibrated traceable power measurement devices suitable for sources which are frequently broadband and typically less than 100 µW. The technological challenge centres on designing a detector with a frequency-independent responsivity over a very large bandwidth and capable of detecting incident power down to a few µW (see section 16 ). This is being addressed by the team at PTB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Germany) [ 206 ] who have been developing and have now demonstrated a pyroelectric power meter calibrated using radiometric techniques.\nFTS is a mature and established technology in the near- and mid-infrared, and its extension into the THz band is relatively straightforward. However, historically it has been used primarily to identify resonance absorption features in a variety of materials. In contrast, THz spectroscopy most often requires accurate determination of the absorption coefficient and refractive index from featureless spectral data, especially in the frequency band where TDS is also available. FTS, however, is less well suited to such measurements, because derivation of these optical constants from intensity data is problematic. Design, performance and parameter extraction using far-IR FTS are thoroughly reviewed in numerous books on the subject, e.g. [ 207 , 208 ].\nTDS, as the newest and least mature spectroscopic technique encounters metrological challenges specific to this modality. Similarly to other instrumental platforms, these are of three types: device configuration and performance; sample effects; and parameter extraction algorithms. One of the most important papers in THz metrology was the analysis of the limits placed on the spectral bandwidth of a TDS by its dynamic range in frequency domain [ 209 ]. Similarly, the dynamic range of a TDS in time domain was shown to limit its frequency resolution [ 210 ]. Since the dynamic range is in turn limited by system noise, sources of noise are an important parameter of TDS performance. The greatest attention has been accorded to the methods of parameter extraction, where calculation procedures have been proposed and analysed by several authors, e.g. [ 211 , 212 ]. The uncertainties in the obtained optical constants (absorption coefficient and refractive index) have also been analysed in detail, e.g. [ 213 , 214 ].\nFree-space THz measurements are currently encountering several different metrological problems, which also vary among the instrumentation platforms. FTS and TDS share a significant problem in the lack of agreed calibration standards or artefacts for the THz band. Because measurements at THz frequencies are used to determine the optical constants of materials, standards are required for frequency, optical thickness (phase delay) and loss. There is also a lack of rigorous measurement intercomparison studies between FTS and TDS. In addition, several metrological issues specific to TDS have not yet been adequately addressed. The most important of these are: the effects of instrument performance and of different THz beam path configurations; and the accuracy of different methods of parameter extraction and their suitability to various types of sample. An international intercomparison study of different TDS systems and measurement techniques is currently taking place, aimed at resolving some of these questions.\nCurrent VNAs enable measurements to be made at all frequencies up to 1.1 THz. This is achieved by using harmonic multiplying and mixing which takes place in extender heads that are attached to the VNA. A pair of extender heads, fitted with waveguide test ports, is needed so that two-port devices (i.e. devices with both an input and an output) can be measured using signals propagating in both forward and reverse directions.\nThe aperture size of the waveguide is chosen to support the required frequency range; standardised waveguide sizes are available for frequencies to 3.3 THz and beyond [ 215 ]. Measurements can also be made on planar wafer substrates by attaching probes to the waveguide test ports; these are currently available at frequencies up to 1.1 THz [ 216 ]. Obtaining the required machining tolerances of waveguides used at THz frequencies is a major technological challenge. These tolerances give rise to both random and systematic errors in measurements made using waveguides, which arise from interface reflections when two connected waveguides are either misaligned or have slightly differing aperture dimensions (height and width) [ 215 ]. Although reflection losses in pristine, optically polished metals are well known, variations in waveguide losses arising from surface defects, oxidation and roughness have not been investigated or quantified.\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges.\nThe metrological challenges in free-space THz measurements are primarily organisational rather than technological. International standards must be agreed; calibration artefacts must be developed and tested; and procedures for instrumentation and device specifications must be defined.\nThe most important technological challenge of using metallic waveguides at THz frequencies is to increase the dimensional precision of mechanically machined waveguide components—particularly, waveguide interfaces and apertures, as shown in table 3 . Although aperture tolerances of 5.1 µm and 1.7 µm (for a reflection coefficient of  −42 dB at mm-wave frequencies) are achievable using current technology, tolerances of 0.50 µm and 0.17 µm (for a reflection coefficient of  −42 dB at THz frequencies) are considered beyond state-of-the-art, at least for routine industrial manufacturing capabilities.\nTable 3. Required aperture tolerances for  −42 dB reflection coefficient to 3.3 THz, and reflection coefficient values achieved by the existing IEEE 1785.2a interface [ 217 ] to 3.3 THz.\nFrequency range\n""","0.057043962","""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/50/4/043001/meta;jsessionid=349D7F525F4D06D7F8E8CC14E1A6B044.c1.iopscience.cld.iop.org""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

Road vehicles account for almost half of the energy used in all transport modes globally. Reducing energy use in vehicles is key to meeting the forecast increase in demand for transport, while improving energy security and mitigating climate change. Non-powertrain vehicle options may reduce fuel consumption by at least 15%. Electric motors are the significant powertrain option to reduce energy use in vehicles because they are more efficient than the internal combustion engine and can recover a portion of the vehicle kinetic energy during braking. Conventionally, batteries are used to meet both the power and energy demands of electric vehicles and their variants. However, batteries are well-suited to store energy, while ultra-capacitors and high-speed flywheels are better placed to meet the bidirectional, high power requirements of real-world driving. Combining technologies with complementary strengths can yield a lower cost and more efficient energy storage system. While pure and hybrid electric vehicles use less energy than internal combustion engine vehicles, their ability to mitigate climate change is a function of the emissions intensity of the processes used to generate their electricity.\nItem Type:\n""","14.611201","""http://publications.eng.cam.ac.uk/681604/""",

"""Imperial_College_London""","""Highlights of the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference 2011Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine - Rishi Pabary, Rebecca Thursfield, Jane C Davies, 2012""","""CF pigs and ferrets develop spontaneous airway infections;\n(iii)\nAbnormalities of airways surface liquid (ASL) are thought to contribute to CF lung disease; ASL in the CF pig was shown to have increased viscosity, possibly attributable to reduced pH and/or HCO3− (#73) although antimicrobial activity was similar to controls (#163);\n(iv)\nCF pig lung histology at a few months of life demonstrates inflammation and remodelling, although in newborn pigs such histological changes are absent and proinflammatory cytokines are not raised. This suggests infection precedes inflammation.\nMicrobiology\nThere is increasing recognition that our conventional view of the lower airway as being ‘sterile’ in health and infected by a ‘narrow range of bacterial pathogens’ in CF is completely incorrect. Several abstracts were presented on the detection of lower airway pathogens by non-culture based molecular techniques (#260-3). Most investigators agree that multiple pathogens are present in the BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) or sputum and there are some emerging data to suggest that an infective exacerbation is accompanied not by new or increased numbers of organisms, but by shifts in populations and diversity. Once again, the regional variation in CF lungs was demonstrated by distinct genetic sub-populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa being encountered in different lobes (#249). The prevalence of these subpopulations changed significantly during an infective exacerbation (#250). Sampling from the upper airway may be very misleading (#263). Patrick Flume, in his excellent plenary lecture on infective exacerbations (P3), raised the important question of how we can recognize the harmful pathogens amongst this bacterial ‘soup’; this active area of research needs to address some questions of clinical relevance to fulfil its promise.\nLung defence\nThere was once again a debate surrounding whether or not there is a primary defect in CF circulating inflammatory cells; as this field evolves, the consensus seems to be ‘Yes’ although the level of such a defect may be small and clinical significance in humans is uncertain (S12.1). There were several abstracts on the potential role of vitamin D in lung innate defence, various groups reporting on the relationship between serum vitamin D level and lung function although results were conflicting. (#S2.2, #484, #144, #83, #496). A systematic review of this topic (#517) concluded that there is a weak positive correlation. A small intervention study randomized 30 patients admitted to hospital with pulmonary exacerbation to IM vitamin D or placebo (#526). They measured lung function, vitamin D and cathelecidin - an antimicrobial peptide thought to be induced by vitamin D. In the vitamin D group, cathelecidin was significantly increased at weeks 1 and 12. It was shown that 78% of patients had a return of their FEV1 to baseline compared with just 38% of the placebo group, although this failed to reach statistical significance. The CFF established a working party to formulate guidelines for vitamin D levels deficiency (currently in submission)(#S2.2), which recommend annual vitamin D levels, ideally towards the end of winter when vitamin D levels reach their nadir; 25(OH) levels should be used and a level >30 ng/mL (75 mmol/L) is recommended; vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is more effective than D2 (ergocalciferol) and should be given orally, either daily or weekly; levels should be re-checked 3 months after commencing supplementation. A dosing plan is given within the guidelines. Vitamin D levels often increase post lung transplantation (#S2.3) without alteration of supplementation. Many drugs used post-transplant affect the metabolic pathway, either reducing or (more commonly) increasing serum vitamin D levels. This highlights the importance of considering drug interactions when commencing new medications.\nConventional management and monitoring\nSection:\nA retrospective evaluation (#330) of 180 courses of intravenous antibiotics in 81 children showed that 47% returned to baseline predicted FEV1 on Day 7 of IV treatment, compared to 64% by Day 14 (P < 0.005). Median FEV1 on Day 7 was 77% of predicted, compared with a median of 83% predicted on Day 14 of treatment. An Australian trial on 63 subjects over 5 months failed to find any clinical benefit of the oral macrolide, clarithromycin (#351). An interesting case was presented in the Fellows’ session of persistent, severe haemoptysis responding promptly and dramatically to treatment with the beta-blocking agent, atenolol. The mechanism is unclear but likely relates to reduction in pulmonary arterial pressures.\nThe validity of FEV1, as a primary outcome measure in CF trials was questioned (S14.4), as the annual change is small and may lead to underestimation of disease severity although it is still applicable if a large treatment effect is anticipated (as in the case of VX-770). Lung clearance index may be abnormal in children with normal FEV1, although it may not correlate with bronchiectasis and air trapping on high resolution CT scan (HRCT) in children under the age of two. Although HRCT is sensitive and reliable, and standardised automated interpretation is on the horizon, it is not easily repeatable due to concerns regarding anaesthesia and radiation exposure. An Australian study (#S5.2) has enrolled CF babies diagnosed by NBS and found that by the age of 3 years, 75% had CT scan evidence of bronchiectasis; presence was associated with a severe genotype, pulmonary infection and neutrophilic inflammation. Although pulmonary exacerbations remain difficult to define accurately, data from the Toronto group indicate that they are responsible for half of the decline in lung function observed over a 6-7 year time period; perhaps we should be focusing on them more? It is apparent that the lack of sensitive bio-markers to track disease progression is a significant unmet need in CF. Those discussed at the NACFC included CRP (#81), catecholamines in airway fluid (#84), procalcitonin (#247), cytokines in CF-related arthropathy (#241) and arylsulfatase B (#233); the reliability and validity of nasal PD was reviewed (#228). There were two novel biomarkers that we felt were worth highlighting: (a) CD203c and CD63: Basophils play a major role in the allergic response and it was shown that their surface levels of CD203c and CD63 increase significantly upon stimulation with Aspergillus fumigatus, a finding that is allergen-specific. CD203c was also found to be an excellent predictor for discriminating between colonized patients and those with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), and for monitoring treatment response; at £200 per assay it may be a viable biomarker in Aspergillus management; (b) CD16b-AAT: CD16b-alpha-l-antitrypsin is a marker of neutrophil priming that is shed when the neutrophil membrane is exposed to chemokines such as IL-8. CD16b-AAT and IL-8 levels correlated and both fell in response to antibiotic treatment (P = 0.03), whilst FEV1 pre-and post-exacerbation was inversely associated with both biomarkers (#85). Hence, CD16b-AAT may represent a promising biomarker of inflammatory status in CF and, as neutrophil priming must, by definition, occur prior to activation and migration of neutrophils towards the lung, monitoring levels may allow exacerbations to be detected prior to evolution of clinical symptoms.\nProgress with novel therapies\nSmall molecule drugs\nAtaluren\nThis drug, aimed at allowing ribosomal read-through of nonsense (class 1 mutations) is being studied in a large, multinational phase 3 trial. At the time of the conference, baseline data were available, confirming that this group of 238 patients has a significant burden of disease: at a median age of 23 years, FEV1 was reduced to 60%, respiratory domain of the CFQ-R quality of life questionnaire to 72/100. Sweat chloride and nasal electrophysiological measurements were typical for classic CF. These data would suggest (a) scope for a treatment effect being detectable on these biomarkers and (b) that this population has significant manifestations of disease which could be improved if the trial confirms the drug is beneficial.\nIvacaftor (VX-770)\nThe report of the first phase 3 trial of this oral agent appeared in press during the conference, further increasing the impact of the results, which were discussed in plenary, symposia and several workshop presentations. Ivacaftor has been designed to target class 3, so-called ‘gating’ mutations, as a result of which CFTR reaches the cell surface but fails to open. G551D is by far the commonest gating mutation worldwide and to date, it is patients with this mutation who have been included in trials. Bonnie Ramsay presented the phase 3 data from 161 patients aged 12 years and above, treated twice daily for 48 weeks (#211). Primary outcome was change in FEV1 at 24 weeks; the treatment effect for absolute change was 10.6%, which translated into a relative improvement over baseline of 16.7%. In addition, actively-treated subjects experienced fewer respiratory exacerbations and had significant improvements in the CFQ-R respiratory domain and weight. Sweat chloride levels fell (treatment effect -47.9 mmol/1), many of them to below the CF diagnostic cut-off of 60 mmol/1. There were no safety concerns. In the open label extension study (#204), the previous placebo group demonstrated similar improvements in FEV1 over the 12 weeks reported. The drug showed comparable, dramatic effects in the phase 3 trial in children aged 6-11 years with G551D (#203) and is showing promise in a phase 2 trial in patients with mild lung impairment using LCI as a more sensitive measure of airway disease than FEV1 (#201). VX-770 was shown to possess potentiating capability for other gating mutations (#10), although these are all rare in the CF population. The agent had no effect on subjects homozygous for the Phe508del mutation when used alone, but in combination with the corrector agent, VX-809, it led to a significant drop in sweat chloride (#212); further studies are ongoing to assess whether this is of a sufficient magnitude to lead to clinical benefits. The recent applications for marketing approval in both the US and Europe were highlighted in several presentations, raising hopes that this drug may be available in the clinic in the near future.\nCFTR correctors\nCorrectors, drugs which allow misfolded CFTR to traffic to the cell surface, have been long sought after at great expense by academics and the pharmaceutical industry alike. The description at this year's conference of two separate misfolding events in Phe508del (in both NBD1 and domain assembly) perhaps goes some way to explaining why this has proved so difficult to date. However, the success of VX-770 has clearly catalyzed a renewed resurgence of interest in small molecule therapies. The CFF announced a major new collaborative project with Genzyme, investigators highlighted Pfizer's corrector programme and the Vertex compound VX-661 was mentioned.\nAntibiotic agents\nThe results of a multi-cycle open-label trial of nebulized Arikace (liposomal Amikacin) in patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, showed that FEV1 had increased by 11.7% at the end of treatment with a sustained increase of 5.7% after 56 days off 6th cycle of treatment. There was a significant reduction in density of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and no significant shift in the mean inhibitory concentration (MIC). Phase 3 studies are underway (#221). A placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized controlled trial of Aztreonam for inhalation (AZLI, #234) found no difference in FEV1 or any secondary outcome measure in 100 patients chronically infected with Burkholderia cepacia complex. AZLI was compared to Tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) in patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa with significantly more patients on AZLI displaying either ≥8% or ≥12% improvement in FEV1 at 28 days, an effect that persisted over three treatment courses (#216). 288 patients chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been randomized to Ciprofloxacin dry powder for inhalation (DPI) or placebo in a Phase IIB study and data analysis is ongoing (#235).\nGene therapy\nWe presented data from the UK CF Gene Therapy Consortium from both animal toxicology (#238, #197) and human (#198) studies. The non-viral formulation is safe in repeated dose animal studies and encouragingly, shows increased expression with repeated dosing. A safe dose was established from the single dose human pilot study, with long duration of functional efficacy being demonstrated in some subjects on nasal electrophysiological testing. Funding permitting, a repeated dose trial designed to assess clinical benefit will begin in early 2012.\nSummary\nSection:\nThe conference succeeded once again in bringing together basic scientists, clinicians and the allied professions in a rich mix of presentations. The additional excitement generated by the success of a new drug heightened the usual levels of enthusiasm. To have, for the first time, efficacy with a small molecule is worth so much more than the hope it provides to the 1 in 25 CF patients fortunate enough to possess a Class 3 mutation. It tells us that CFTR is a molecule worth targeting; the effort may be huge, but the rewards are potentially even more so.\nAcknowledgements\n""","0.16704085","""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1258/jrsm.2012.12s002""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

We first analysed the distribution within the hydrogel construct and the phenotype of human articular chondrocytes (HACs) cultured for 3 weeks in vitro. We observed a statistically significant increase in the cell number during the first 2 weeks and maintenance of cell viability throughout the cell culture, together with the deposition/formation of a cartilage-specific extracellular matrix (ECM). Taking advantage of a new in vivo model that allows the integration between newly formed and preexisting cartilage in immunodeficient mice to be investigated, we showed that injectable hydrogel seeded with human articular chondrocytes was able to regenerate and repair an experimentally made lesion in bovine articular cartilage, thus demonstrating the potential of this novel cell delivery system for cartilage tissue engineering.

In this paper, three types of interior PMSMs with different PM arrangements are modeled by the finite element method (FEM). For a given amount of permanent magnet materials, the V-shape interior PMSM is found better than the U-shape and the conventional rotor topologies for EV traction drives. Then the V-shape interior PMSM is further analyzed with the effects of stator slot opening and the permanent magnet pole chamfering on cogging torque and output torque performance. A vector-controlled flux-weakening method is developed and simulated in Matlab to expand the motor speed range for EV drive system. The results show good dynamic and steady-state performance with a capability of expanding speed up to four times of the rated. A prototype of the V-shape interior PMSM is also manufactured and tested to validate the numerical models built by the FEM.\nDocuments\nRights statement: Copyright  2017 IEEE - All rights reserved.

The system Better Place proposed had two novel prongs; first, to reduce the cost of batteries, and second, to reduce range anxiety, public infrastructure concerns, and long charging times. Yet, despite this seemingly strong combination, Better Place failed to make any progress in Denmark and Israel, the first two markets it operated in, and subsequently declared bankruptcy, selling off its collective assets for less than $500,000. Drawing from science and technology studies and the notion of “interpretive flexibility,” this paper posits several reasons to explain the failure of Better Place, including that Denmark is not as “green” as it seems nor is the Israeli market as attractive as believed, and that Better Place's solution to charging time and range anxiety resolved a psychological, not a functional, barrier of the general public to adopt electric vehicles. Before investigating these two reasons, the paper presents a short history of Better Place and explores the contours of its operations in Denmark and Israel. It then discusses why Better Place “failed” across both countries before concluding with implications for energy planning, policy, and analysis.\nItem Type:\n""","10.548218","""http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/60664/""","[-0.087076,50.86447]"

This exploratory study evaluates the effects of a vibrotactile (or haptic) accelerator pedal on car driving performance and perceived workload using a driving simulator. A stimulus was triggered when the driver exceeded a 50% throttle threshold, past which is deemed excessive for economical driving. Results showed significant decreases in mean acceleration values, and maximum and excess throttle use when the haptic pedal was active as compared to a baseline condition. As well as the positive changes to driver behaviour, subjective workload decreased when driving with the haptic pedal as compared to when drivers were simply asked to drive economically. The literature suggests that the haptic processing channel offers a largely untapped resource in the driving environment, and could provide information without overloading the other attentional resource pools used in driving.\nPractitioner Summary: Overloaded or distracted drivers present a real safety danger to themselves and others. Providing driving-related feedback can improve performance but risks distracting them further; however, giving such information through the underused haptic processing channel can provide the driver with critical information without overloading the driver's visual channel.\n""","0.25618035","""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139.2012.760750""",

The novel aspect of the introduced methodology is in providing a solution to the issue of lack of data on the speed of vehicles prior to the crash, which is required to calculate the velocity change, as well as a solution to the issue of lack of information on non-injury two-car crashes in national accident data. These issues have often led to focussing on relative measures of injury risk that are not independent of risk in the colliding cars. Furthermore, the introduced methodology is used to investigate whether there is any effect of vehicle size above and beyond that of mass ratio, and whether there are any effects associated with the gender and age of the drivers. The methodology was used to analyse two-car crashes to investigate the partial effects of vehicle mass and size on absolute driver injury risk. The results confirmed that in a two-car collision, vehicle mass has a protective effect on its own driver injury risk and an aggressive effect on the driver injury risk of the colliding vehicle. The results also confirmed that there is a protective effect of vehicle size above and beyond that of vehicle mass for frontal and front to side collisions.\nPublication data is maintained in RPS.

It has brought electric vehicles back into the spotlight worldwide at a moment when fossil fuel prices were reaching unexpected high due to increased demand and strong economic growth. The energy storage capabilities from of fleets of electric vehicles as well as the potentially random discharging and charging offers challenges to the grid in terms of operation and control. Optimal scheduling strategies are key to integrating large numbers of electric vehicles and the smart grid. In this paper, state-of-the-art optimization methods are reviewed on scheduling strategies for the grid integration with electric vehicles. The paper starts with a concise introduction to analytical charging strategies, followed by a review of a number of classical numerical optimization methods, including linear programming, non-linear programming, dynamic programming as well as some other means such as queuing theory. Meta-heuristic techniques are then discussed to deal with the complex, high-dimensional and multi-objective scheduling problem associated with stochastic charging and discharging of electric vehicles.

The overall quality of a composite index depends upon the complexity of phenomena of interest as well as the relevance of the methodological approach used to aggregate the various indicators into a single composite index. However, current aggregation methods used to estimate the composite road safety performance index suffer from various deficiencies at both the theoretical and operational level; these include the correlation and compensability between indicators, the weighting of the indicators as well as their high “degree of freedom” which enables one to readily manipulate them to produce desired outcomes (Munda and Nardo, 2003, 2005, 2009). The objective of this study is to contribute to the ongoing research effort on the estimation of road safety composite index for hotspots’ identification and ranking. The aggregation method for constructing the composite road safety performance index introduced in this paper, strives to minimize the aforementioned deficiencies of the current approaches.

Associations of PM10 and PMcoarse were attenuated to the null for both outcomes when adjusted for NO2. The association between NO2 and shortness of breath was not affected by adjustment for PM2.5, but NO2 was not associated with wheeze after adjustment ( Table 3 ). Associations between pollutant exposure at residence and wheeze and shortness of breath were generally unchanged when restricting analyses to participants who lived at the same address for ≥5 y and ≥10 y (see Table S7).\nFigures 2 and 3 outline pooled subgroup analyses for exposure to PM2.5 and PMcoarse, respectively. PM2.5 exposure was not associated with wheeze in higher-income individuals [OR=1.02 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.08) per 5 μg/m3] but was associated with wheeze in lower-income participants [OR=1.30 (95% CI: 1.22, 1.38); p-interaction<0.001]. Moreover, the association between shortness of breath and a 5-μg/m3 increment in PM2.5 was significantly higher among individuals from lower-income households [adjusted OR=1.73 (95% CI: 1.52, 1.97)] than among higher-income individuals [adjusted OR=1.31 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.55); p-interaction=0.005]. Age, smoking status, and asthma status also modified associations between PM2.5 and wheeze symptoms, with slightly stronger associations for those ≥65 years of age (vs. <65; p-interaction=0.004), past or current smokers (vs. never smokers; p-interaction<0.001) and people without asthma (vs. those with asthma; p-interaction=0.005). With regard to PM2.5, the association between PMcoarse and shortness of breath was stronger for lower-income participants than for higher-income participants [OR=1.41 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.61) vs. 1.09 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.30); p-interaction=0.009] although there was no clear difference in the association between PMcoarse and wheeze according to income. Lastly, PMcoarse was associated with shortness of breath among nonobese participants [OR=1.41 (95% CI: 1.23, 1.63)] but not among obese participants [OR=1.02 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.20); p-interaction=0.002].\nFigure 2.

Interaction p-values are Wald p-values for product interaction terms between air pollutants and stratification variables. Non-italic p-values (top), wheeze symptoms; Italic p-values (bottom), shortness-of-breath symptoms.\nBoth PM10 and NO2 were associated with wheeze in lower-income individuals but not in higher-income participants (see Figures S1 and S2). Associations between NO2 (but not PM10) and shortness of breath were also significantly stronger for lower-income individuals than for higher-income participants (see Figures S1 and S2). Lastly, interaction for obesity status was observed for PM10 and NO2 associations with shortness of breath, with nonobese participants showing significantly stronger associations.\nDiscussion\nIn this pooled study, we found statistically significant associations between mean annual PM and NO2 exposure and self-reported wheeze and shortness-of-breath symptoms. The strongest estimated associations were between fine particulate matter and self-reported shortness-of-breath symptoms, although there was little evidence of an association after adjustment for NO2. The use of large biobanks resulted in a large sample size that provided good statistical power to explore potentially vulnerable population subgroups. Our estimates suggested stronger associations of PM2.5 with both wheeze and shortness-of-breath symptoms, and of PMcoarse with shortness of breath, among participants with lower incomes compared with those with higher incomes. Associations between PM2.5 and wheeze were significantly higher among older versus younger participants, past or current smokers versus never smokers, and people without versus with asthma. In addition, PMcoarse was associated with shortness of breath among nonobese participants, but not among obese participants.\nA previous longitudinal analysis of data from six European cohorts that also used ESCAPE exposure estimates reported positive but nonsignificant associations of NO2, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and PM exposure metrics with asthma incidence ( Jacquemin et al. 2015 ), and another analysis based on data from four of these six cohorts reported nonsignificant positive associations of NO2, NOx, and PM10 with COPD prevalence and incidence ( Schikowski et al. 2014 ). More recently, significant positive associations were reported for PM10 and NO2 exposures (estimated using ESCAPE models) with lifetime asthma prevalence (a self-reported history of ever having had asthma) and current asthma (a self-reported history of asthma plus current or recent use of asthma medications) in a combined analysis of data from UK Biobank, Lifelines, and the Norwegian Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT3) cohorts ( Cai et al. 2017 ). Associations between air pollutants and prevalent wheeze based on our analysis of UK Biobank and Lifelines data were similar to those reported by Cai et al. ( 2017 ) for lifetime asthma prevalence. Specifically, for a 5-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, we estimated OR=1.16 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.21) compared with OR=1.11 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.16); for a 5-μg/m3 increase in PM10, we estimated OR=1.03 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.05) compared with OR=1.04 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.06); for a 5-μg/m3 increase in PMcoarse, we estimated OR=1.05 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.10) compared with OR=1.04 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.09); and for a 10-μg/m3 increase in NO2, we estimated OR=1.03 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.04) compared with OR=1.02 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.04) from Cai et al. ( 2017 ).\nAssociations between air pollutants and shortness of breath were stronger than corresponding associations with wheeze in our study population, which might be consistent with cardiovascular effects ( Ebi-Kryston 1988 ) rather than (or in addition to) respiratory effects. A previous study of residential ambient air pollutant concentrations in Swiss adults reported associations with the prevalence of breathlessness, but not wheeze ( Zemp et al. 1999 ), and adults living along busy streets in Netherlands were more likely to report shortness of breath during walking, but not wheeze, than adults living along low-traffic streets in the same neighborhoods ( Oosterlee et al. 1996 ). However, these findings may also represent reporting misclassification: although individuals diagnosed with asthma are likely to recognize the symptom of wheeze, the rest of the population might not and therefore might label the symptom as shortness of breath. Wheeze is not always well recognized in the general population. In the seminal International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC), many countries used a video to demonstrate wheezing symptoms without using the word wheezing and asked if the child had these symptoms, as well as using a written questionnaire using the word “wheezing.” Results comparing prevalence tertiles determined using the video versus those determined using the written questionnaire were discordant in a third of centers ( Beasley 1998 ).\nOur study provides evidence in line with previous reports that lower household income may be associated with greater impact of particulate matter pollution on respiratory health ( Wheeler and Ben-Shlomo 2005 ), which is of concern because lower-SES individuals are potentially more likely to have higher exposures. As shown in a recent neighborhood-level study conducted in the same countries as these cohorts (i.e., Netherlands and the United Kingdom), the highest particulate matter and NO2 concentrations were consistently found in the most deprived areas in both countries ( Fecht et al. 2015 ). Lower-SES individuals might be more susceptible to health effects of air pollution exposures because of coexposures to other environmental stressors (e.g., housing conditions, occupational exposures) or because of comorbid conditions related to reduced access to health care or to lifestyle, diet, and other factors ( Lipfert 2004 ).\nA review of factors associated with increased susceptibility to the health effects of air pollution suggested that older individuals and people with asthma are at increased risk ( Sacks et al. 2011 ), consistent with our findings. Although some previous studies have reported evidence suggesting that obese people are more susceptible to health effects of air pollution than nonobese people ( Sacks et al. 2011 ), we estimated stronger associations between PMcoarse, PM10, and NO2 and shortness of breath among nonobese individuals than among obese individuals in our study population. A subjective increase in shortness of breath among obese individuals might largely be explained by decreased respiratory muscle function and higher levels of systemic inflammation ( Carpio et al. 2016 ), and any additional impact of air pollution on breathlessness could be negligible in this subgroup.\nMultipollutant modeling has been proposed as a solution to the problem of double counting or overestimating the effects of any one pollutant ( Héroux et al. 2015 ). In our study, the association between PM2.5 and wheeze was robust to adjustment for NO2, and the association between NO2 and shortness of breath was robust to adjustment for PM2.5, whereas other associations were attenuated to the null after adjustment for a second pollutant. However, the two-pollutant model results should be interpreted with caution because of the different sample sizes, the high correlation between pollutants, and the different pollutant correlation structures across the cohorts included in this study.\nFine particulates (i.e., PM2.5) have been reported to have stronger associations with respiratory or cardiovascular mortality relative to coarse (i.e., PM2.5–10) particulates ( Brunekreef and Forsberg 2005 ; Faustini et al. 2014 ). This difference might be explained by a wider diffusion of fine particulates in the respiratory tract and by a stronger systemic inflammatory response. However, PMcoarse has been shown to have as strong or stronger short-term effects on COPD, asthma, and respiratory hospital admissions ( Brunekreef and Forsberg 2005 ). For wheeze symptoms, we found consistently stronger associations with PM2.5 than with PMcoarse exposure in pooled and study-specific analyses. The association between PMcoarse and shortness of breath was stronger than the association between PM2.5 and shortness of breath in the Lifelines cohort, where participants were asked if they had ever had an attack of shortness of breath during the day when they were at rest. In contrast, the association between PM2.5 and shortness of breath was stronger than the association between PMcoarse and shortness of breath in the UK Biobank cohort, where participants were asked if they had ever had shortness of breath while walking. These divergent results might reflect differences between the study populations in the composition and sources of coarse particles, the data collection instruments used by each cohort, the way in which participants interpreted the questions about shortness of breath, or other factors ( Gjersing et al. 2010 ; Guillemin et al. 1993 ). Further, whereas the UK Biobank questionnaire collected period-specific wheeze prevalence (i.e., in the last year), the lack of a specified period in the Lifelines assessment item might have led to recall bias. To help overcome such challenges in the future, new studies should make use of internationally validated questionnaires whenever possible. Implementing standardized questionnaires on asthma and COPD respiratory symptoms and risk factors in epidemiological studies would greatly facilitate comparing and pooling data ( Pistelli and Maio 2014 ).\nA few limitations with regard to exposure assessment should be noted. First, because no information on study participants’ work addresses or time-activity patterns was available in either cohort, air pollution exposure was only estimated at the home address. A study that compared exposures estimated with and without accounting for daily mobility in the metropolitan Vancouver, British Columbia area and in southern California found that estimates that did not account for mobility were biased toward the null, with greater bias when the spatial variability of pollution was higher ( Setton et al. 2011 ). Second, applying the ESCAPE southeast England LUR models to the larger UK Biobank study area could have led to exposure measurement error. However, LUR models provided good predictions of historical NO2 concentrations across the United Kingdom (R>2=0.67) and good predictions of PM10 concentrations within a 400-km radius of the initial ESCAPE study area (R2=0.53) ( Gulliver and de Hoogh 2015 ).\nPooled analyses would have been more strongly influenced by data from the UK Biobank cohort than from the Lifelines cohort because of the larger number of UK Biobank observations included in the analyses. Further, although only 45% of total Lifelines participants had been attributed air pollution exposure estimates, we do not expect selection bias to have been a major problem because participant residences were geocoded in chronological order (i.e., in the order of recruitment) rather than according to any given participant characteristic. Residual confounding, exposure and outcome misclassification, and other potential sources of bias are also possible. Finally, given the cross-sectional nature of our analyses, we cannot confirm the temporal relationship between air pollution exposures and the respiratory symptoms in our study population.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the findings from our cross-sectional analysis of data from adult cohorts in the United Kingdom and Netherlands add to existing evidence of the adverse effects of ambient air pollution on respiratory health in adults. In addition, differences in associations among population subgroups may reflect differences in susceptibility according to age, SES, and other factors.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the services of the staff at UK Biobank and the Lifelines Cohort Study, the contributing research centers delivering data on these two cohorts, and all the study participants.

In addition to the anticipated growth in biofuels, this target is expected to be met by the increased electrification of transport coupled with a growing contribution from renewable energy to electricity generation. Energy use in transport accounted for nearly half of Ireland’s total final energy demand and about a third of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2007. Energy use in transport has grown by 6.3% per annum on average in the period 1990 – 2007. This high share and fast growth relative to other countries highlights the challenges Ireland faces in meeting ambitious renewable energy targets. The Irish Government has set a specific target for Electric Vehicles (EV) as part of its strategy to deliver the 10% RES-T target. By 2020, 10% of all vehicles in its transport fleet are to be powered by electricity. This paper quantifies the impacts on energy and carbon dioxide emissions of this 10% EV target by 2020. In order to do this an ‘EV Car Stock’ model was developed to analyse the historical and future make-up of the passenger car portion of the fleet to 2025. Three scenarios for possible take-up in EVs were examined and the associated energy and emissions impacts are quantified. These impacts are then compared to Ireland’s 10% RES-T target and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets for 2020. Two key findings of the study are that the 10% EV target contributes 1.7% to the 10% RES-T target by 2020 and 1.4% to the 20% reduction in Non-ETS emissions by 2020 relative to 2005.\nLinks\n""","8.766721","""http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/quantifying-the-energy--carbon-emissions-implications-of-a-10-electric-vehicles-target(bad8810f-dcc7-424c-95b2-71d7bc4e001d).html""","[-5.934759,54.583863]"

The failure to develop the air traffic system in order to cope with this growth has had undesirable consequences, e.g. a rise in flight delays and near misses. Given the investment required in air traffic control systems to cater for this growth, the UK government in 2000 part privatized the National Air Traffic Services (NATS), the body in charge of the UK's airspace in a public–private partnership (PPP). The UK Airline Group acquired 46% of NATS and effective operational control, though the government retains a share in NATS and safety regulation is in the public sector. However, serious doubts about safety were raised during the debate on the PPP. Similar moves towards a commercial operation (i.e. corporatization) of air navigation services have been made in New Zealand and Canada over the past decade and these provide useful insights into the results of the corporatization process. This paper analyses the main issues surrounding the part privatization of NATS. First, it highlights the experience from New Zealand and Canada of the major issues involved in corporatized air navigation services in six different categories: funding, new technology and project management, safety, pricing regime, international opportunities, and customer responsiveness. The likely impacts for NATS given the lessons from New Zealand and Canada are considered. The UK government's provisions for the PPP and their implementation in the post‐PPP NATS are then outlined for these six categories. Finally, the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks have had major impacts on air travel and their consequences for NATS in the six categories are highlighted. This paper concludes with some of the issues that need to be addressed to ensure the success of the PPP for NATS.\nAdditional information\nAuthor information\nA. MAJUMDAR Correspondence Address: A.

Different components in a vehicle have to constantly exchange available information with other vehicles on the road and cooperate for the purpose of ensuring safety and comfort using a Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET). Critical information like navigation, cooperative collision avoidance, lane-changing, speed limit, accident, obstacle or road condition warnings, etc. play a significant role for safety-related applications in VANET. Such kind of critical information gathering and dissemination is challenging, because of their delay-sensitive nature. This paper proposes an agent based model that consists of heavy-weight static cognitive (based on Belief Desire Intention : BDI) and light-weight mobile agents. Proposed model executes push (gather/store and disseminate) and pull (gather/store) operations on information gathered based on information relevance, criticalness and importance. The simulation results show that BDI based information gathering and dissemination scheme performs better than the reliable broadcast scheme in terms of bandwidth utilization, packet delivery ratio, push latency (information saturation time) and push/pull decision latency.\nKeywords\nVehicular ad hoc networks Cognitive agents BDI architecture \nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access\nPreview\nUnable to display preview.  Download preview PDF.\nReferences\n1.\nCaliskan, M., Mauve, M., Rech, B., & Luebke, A.

R. Seemungal\nPDF\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a leading cause of death worldwide, with a rising prevalence in newly developed and developing countries, including China, the world's most populous country. This article focuses on information on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine in 2014 and will update the reader on pathophysiology, imaging, natural history, treatment, and prevention of this condition.\nIn homozygous alpha-1 antitrypsin (AT) deficiency–associated COPD, inflammation is now clearly linked to the genetic lesion, as is impaired innate immunity in the airway. This latter results from lesions in both TNF-α– and TGF-β–dependent pathways but also involves a prolonged unfolded protein response, proline-glycine-proline (PGP) peptide fragments, and dysregulation of T-cell subsets. COPD phenotypes may depend on the type of particulate insult to the airway but also on lipid expression in the airways. Ethnicity-specific components of COPD were discovered in 2014. In applying the results of studies to clinical practice, the phenotype of COPD studied may be of greater importance, and in several such patients the clinical trial reference standard may not be adhered to. Treatment may soon be available for the prevention of pulmonary hypertension in COPD. The research agenda being formulated by the NHLBI will no doubt guide future research in this field.

The normal variant is termed M-AT, but severe deficiency of AT is usually caused by homozygosity for the Z mutation. The accepted mechanism for COPD causation in homozygous Z-AT (ZZ-AT) is proteinase excess leading to accelerated alveolar destruction and early-onset emphysema ( 1 ).\nInflammation in Alpha-1 AT Deficiency\nUsing a mouse model of Z-AT, Alam and colleagues ( 2 ) showed that, compared with M-AT, transgenic ZZ-AT mice exposed to cigarette smoke had higher levels of pulmonary cytokines, neutrophils, and macrophages and an exaggerated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Next the authors looked at explanted lungs of MM-AT and ZZ-AT individuals and found that the ER overload response was greater in lungs from ZZ-AT homozygotes with COPD and more so in epithelial cells of the lung. Cigarette smoke increased intracellular Z-AT polymers, ER overload response, and proinflammatory cytokine release (importantly TNF-α) in Z-AT–expressing pulmonary epithelial cells. This inflammatory response could be prevented with inhibitors of polymerization or protein kinase RNA–like ER kinase or by antioxidants ( 2 ). Figure 1 summarizes our current understanding, which is that the major insult leading to COPD in ZZ-AT is Z-AT polymers in pulmonary cells and that the proinflammatory effects of this pathologic phenomenon are worsened by environmental stress, such as that produced by cigarette smoke and other pollutants ( 3 ).\nFigure 1. (1) In subjects without alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (MM genotypes), inhaled cigarette smoke, occupational exposures to dusts, chemical agents and fumes, and smoke from biomass fuels cause chronic lung inflammation (2), which is enhanced in patients who develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, involving CD81 cytotoxic lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, which release several types of inflammatory mediators, proteases, and oxidants (which are added to the smoke-inhaled ones) (3), finally causing lung destruction with emphysema (4). (5) In Pi*Z (ZZ genotypes) subjects, misfolded Z-AAT molecules and Z-polymers are retained in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hepatocytes, where they can induce ER stress and liver damage (6). Lung disease is attributable to the decreased concentration and low activity of Z-AAT, which is unable to provide adequate protection to the lungs when attacked by proteases (7), and to an oxidant-mediated aggregation of Z-AAT in pulmonary epithelial cells, causing ER stress with proinflammatory cytokine release and amplification of lung inflammation (8). In addition, free Z polymers are chemotactic for activated neutrophils, and this further increases the inflammation and lung tissue damage (9). Reprinted by permission from Reference 3 .\n[More] [Minimize]\nHassan and colleagues showed that a specific micro-RNA (miR-199a-5p) is decreased in monocytes of symptomatic MM and ZZ individuals compared with their asymptomatic counterparts. miR-199a-5p was the most up-regulated in asymptomatic ZZ subjects compared with MM subjects ( 4 ). However, in symptomatic individuals, miR-99a-5p expression was lower than in asymptomatic individuals. The authors also showed that expression of key components of the unfolded protein response within the endoplasmic reticulum were highly expressed in monocytes of symptomatic versus asymptomatic subjects. Cigarette-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress leads to the unfolded protein response, which is dysregulated in part due to underexpression of miR-199a-5p. A prolonged unfolded protein response has been linked to prolonged inflammation and development of COPD ( Figure 1 ) ( 5 ).\nThese results were supported by Geragthy and colleagues, who showed that ZZ-AT patients have reduced protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). They showed that PP2A down-regulates inflammation, protease expression, and apoptosis under smoking conditions in the lung and that this proinflammatory state is further regulated by TNF-α. Closing the loop, they then showed that lower AT levels lead to decreased relative PP2A activity in neutrophils, monocytes, small airway epithelial cells, and A549 cells, thus leading to greater inflammation ( 6 ).\nLung Function and Alpha-1 AT Deficiency\nA study of post-transplant COPD recipients in the absence of alpha-1 AT deficiency (n = 231) and with ZZ-AT COPD (n = 45) found that COPD lung transplant patients with AT deficiency showed a more rapid decline than their AT-replete counterparts for double lung transplants but not single lung transplants. The study found no difference between patients with COPD with and without alpha-1 AT deficiency in frequency of acute cellular rejection or mortality. The result is almost counterintuitive and may have to do with differences in disease expression (and thus inflammation) between the two types of patients chosen for the less and more extensive lung transplants ( 7 ).\nFinally, a study of MZ-AT subjects showed that there is a greater degree of airways obstruction in MZ-AT subjects than in MM-AT subjects with the same degree of smoking ( 8 ).\nAirway Lipidomics and Immunology\nSection:\nLipidomics refers to the pathways and networks of cellular lipids in biological systems. One study showed lipids may have a diagnostic role in COPD. Lipids also have an immunologic role because they form the basis of several of the immunoglobulins. One of the immunoglobulin A receptors can control bronchial epithelial cell differentiation. Although a primary role for inflammation in COPD is discharged by the neutrophil, T regulatory (Treg) cells of the immune system also influence the development of COPD in HIV-positive subjects.\nAirway Lipidomics\nTelenga and colleagues examined the airway lipidome using sputum from nonsmokers and from smokers with and without COPD and showed important differences in lipid composition between those with and those without COPD ( 9 ). A total of 1,500 lipid compounds were identified in the sputum of subjects with COPD, and lipids of the sphingolipid class were found to be more highly expressed in the sputum of smokers with COPD compared with those without COPD. Of the 210 lipids differentially expressed between the three groups, 13 lipids showed at least a 2.5-fold increase between smokers with and without COPD ( Figure 2 ). For these lipids, lipid expression was correlated with extent of obstruction (lower FEV1% and higher residual volume/TLC%) and pack-years of smoking. These findings indicate a pathophysiologic and perhaps diagnostic role of lipids in COPD and are an indication that modification of the airway lipidome may have therapeutic implications ( 10 ).\nFigure 2. The sphingolipid pathway. CerS = ceramide synthases; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; DEGS = dihydroceramide desaturase; GSLs = glycosphingolipids; GTs = glycosyltransferases; SGMSs = sphingomyelin synthases; SMases = sphingomyelinases. Phosphoethanolamine can be used for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis. Phosphoethanolamine could not be detected using the methodology of this study (9), although PEs are more highly expressed. Reprinted by permission from Reference 9 .\n[More] [Minimize]\nImmunology of the Epithelium\nIgA is secreted by the respiratory epithelium due to its innate immunity but may also be adaptively constituted with high affinity for antigen once immune recognition occurs. Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) is expressed on the epithelium and affords transepithelial crossing to IgA synthesized by mucosal plasma cells ( 11 ). Gohy and colleagues showed that the down-regulation of pIgR previously observed in COPD was worse in more severe COPD and was controlled by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. TGF-β has been shown to control epithelial cell differentiation. pIgR expression is reduced in COPD ( 11 ), and its down-regulation correlates with disease severity. Further, the bronchial epithelium reconstituted in vitro from these patients retains its aberrant imprinting for pIgR expression. This study also links pIgR down-regulation to TGF-β–driven reprogramming of the bronchial epithelium, which results in impaired lung IgA immunity in patients with COPD. Thus, in COPD the damaged epithelium becomes less capable of defending itself from external insults.\nCD4+ T Cells and COPD\nHIV-infected smokers are known to be at greater risk of accelerated lung function decline. Popescu and colleagues showed that one of the specific immunopathologic features of HIV-associated COPD is the Fas-dependent activation–induced death of CD4+ cells, which is associated with impaired HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell immunity ( 12 ). Further, lung mucosal CD4+ (but not blood CD4+) was correlated with FEV1 ( 12 ). On the other hand, Kalathil and colleagues studied stable COPD and showed that a subset of CD4+ T cells (i.e., Treg cells) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells are highly suppressive and appear to be responsible for the impaired immune response to nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae. The study found that Treg cells are up-regulated and are more abundant in COPD, whereas T effector cells have reduced responses to bacterial antigen and are further down-regulated by the enhanced Treg cells ( 13 ). The end result of this derangement of T-cell regulatory and effector function is an impaired adaptive immune response, and this appears to apply to both HIV-associated and HIV-independent COPD ( 14 , 15 ). Further, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) appear to indicate a role for CD4+ T cells in emphysema pathogenesis (see below).\nDisorders in Neutrophilic Inflammation\nA study of the murine model of emphysema showed that mice exposed to cigarette smoke developed emphysema with increased proline-glycine-proline (PGP) peptides and acetylated PGPs, neutrophilic inflammation, and selective inhibition of LTA4H peptidase activity, indicating an unrestricted proinflammatory condition ( 16 ). Applying the methods to smokers with and without COPD, these authors found similar results ( 16 ). These data suggest that neutrophilic inflammation in COPD involves generation of PGP and acetylated PGP, both proinflammatory peptides, and that this may be a site for therapeutic action ( 17 ).\nParticulates, Pollutants, and COPD\nSection:\nThe effects of cigarette smoke in adolescents, biomass pathophysiology in COPD, traffic-related black carbon air pollution, and occupational exposures in relation to GOLD grade were explored by the Journal in 2014.\nCigarette Smoke\nHollams and colleagues showed that maternal smoking was associated with lower lung function values in adolescent nonsmokers independent of the association with asthma in this age group ( 18 ). In this study, 8% of adolescents had to be excluded because they voluntarily identified themselves as being addicted to smoking ( 19 ). These data, taken together with the observation by the author of the editorial that the habit has become more fashionable for girls than for boys in some countries, suggests that there will be an increased burden of COPD in the future ( 19 ).\nBiomass and COPD\nRamírez-Venegas and colleagues found that subjects with biomass-induced COPD had lower lung volumes and a slower rate of decline than those with tobacco-induced COPD. However, both groups had more rapid decline in FEV1 in GOLD stages 1 and 2 than in later GOLD stages ( 20 ). The results of this study suggest that biomass-induced COPD is of a different phenotype from tobacco smoke–induced COPD ( 21 ).\nTraffic-related Air Pollutants, Morbidity, and Mortality\nA study of 858 men who had been in the normative aging study showed that a tracer of traffic emissions, black carbon, is associated with worse lung function and decline in lung function even when pollutant levels were within the Environmental Protection Agency National Air Quality Standards ( 22 ). This study is yet more evidence of the effects of air pollutants on respiratory morbidity. However, a large study involving 307,553 subjects from 16 ongoing cohort studies and involving 1,559 respiratory deaths over 6 to 19 years in Europe found no relation between air pollutants (particulate matter and nitrogen oxides but not including ozone or black smoke) and respiratory mortality ( 23 ). However, this may have been because most of the patients in the studies were less than 70 years of age, and most of the effects on respiratory mortality reported in other studies involve deaths in more elderly patients. Despite efforts to reduce air pollutant levels, the prediction for their future effects on respiratory morbidity and mortality are unfavorable because of their synergistic interaction with rising temperatures associated with global climate change ( 24 ).\nOccupational Exposures and COPD\nA study of 9,614 subjects showed that occupational self-reported exposures to dusts or fumes or both for more than 1 year are associated with higher GOLD stage COPD, respiratory symptoms, greater rate of emphysema, and air trapping as estimated by quantitative computed tomography (CT) ( 25 ). In women but not in men, there was also an association of airway wall thickness and history of exposures ( 25 ).\nGenomics\nSection:\nGenome-wide studies showed linkages between CT-defined emphysema and ethnicity as well as in type of emphysema and genetic variants ( Table 2 ).\nTable 2. Summary of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms and Their Related Phenotypes in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease as Discussed in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine in 2014\nPhenotype\nrs56113850 (African Americans and whites)\nCYP2A6/EGLN2/ADCK4\nrs9788721 (whites and African Americans)\nAGPHD1\nrs379123 (whites and African Americans)\nMYO1D\nrs11852372 (whites and African Americans)\nAGPHD1\nrs9590614 (whites and African Americans)\nVWA8\n36\nEthnicity and the Emphysema Phenotype\nA study of 7,914 patients from the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Cohort looked at genetic links to emphysema as assessed by CT scanning ( 26 ). Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms previously linked to lung function in white subjects were shown to be closely associated with percent emphysema across all ethnicities and therefore suggest that these genes contribute to emphysema. Further, common variants in genes associated with α-mannosidase are associated with percent emphysema in African American, Hispanic, and Chinese subjects. α-Mannosidase degrades A1AT, which this is the link between the GWAS findings and percent emphysema ( 27 ).\nGenome-Wide Association Studies in COPD\nCho and colleagues looked at 6,633 subjects from the NETT Genetics, IGGN, Eclipse, and COPDGene Studies and found three new genome-wide significant associations with COPD: a locus near HHIP, one near MMP12, and one near TGFB2 ( 28 ). Another study of 6,184 smokers versus 3,559 smokers with GOLD Stage 2 or greater COPD showed that there are genetic associations with CT-based emphysema patterns of centrilobular and panlobular disease ( 29 ). The emphysema pattern on CT was associated with enhancer regions for these genes: for panlobular emphysema the top GWAS hits occurred in lung-related cell lines of pulmonary fibroblasts, and for centrilobular emphysema the top hits occurred in lymphoblastoid cell lines and CD4+ T cells ( 30 ).\nComorbidity and Natural History of COPD\nSection:\nComorbidity is common in established COPD, but one study suggested that the role of COPD in these comorbid conditions is not causative. Weight gain has differing effects on lung function depending on baseline body mass index. Future risk of cancer in COPD appears more strongly linked to emphysema than to chronic bronchitis. Patent foramen ovale with large shunts is more common in COPD.\nIs COPD a Risk Factor for Comorbidity?\nThis hypothesis was challenged by Van Remoortel and coworkers in a study of smokers with and without COPD compared with age- and sex-matched control subjects ( 31 ). The authors recruited subjects with newly diagnosed COPD during a screening study, which they called “preclinical COPD.” They found that physical inactivity and smoking were more strongly associated with the presence of comorbidities than with COPD. The study suggests that these two factors may represent useful areas for primary and secondary intervention in the early stages of COPD ( 32 ).\nWeight Gain and Lung Function in Smokers\nOne 6-year study showed that weight gain had differential effects on lung function in smokers with and without COPD (mainly GOLD Stages 1 and 2). The lean to underweight subset of patients and the morbidly obese subset both had the lowest FEV1 and worse health status ( 33 ). Further, over the study period, weight gain led to improvements in these outcome measures in the lean to underweight subset but led to deterioration in FEV1 in the morbidly obese group; these changes were independent of smoking and ethnicity ( 33 ). This nonlinear relationship suggests that the effect of weight on lung function before or during early COPD is unlikely to be a purely mechanical effect of obesity on the lung ( 34 ).\nProgression to Lung Cancer\nA large case-control study by Denholm and colleagues showed that two COPD phenotypes—chronic bronchitis and emphysema—were associated with lung cancer, but the relation to lung cancer was stronger for emphysema. The authors admit that COPD was not considered as a single entity; rather, they preferred to look at the separate COPD phenotypes of emphysema and chronic bronchitis because of heterogeneity in their presentation, lung function decline, and survival and also because grouping them together may mask different relationships to lung cancer. Respiratory diagnoses were defined by patient recall (from patient history), and thus the study was subject to misreporting and recall bias. The study suggests that patients in the emphysema phenotype should be selected for closer follow-up for lung cancer ( 35 ).\nGenetics, COPD, and Lung Cancer\nEpithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes such as Snai1 induce and promote EMT ( 36 ). GWASs have shown that some germline variants near to EMT-related genes are associated with lung cancer or COPD. Yang and colleagues showed that the germline variant c.353T>C(p.Val118Ala) of Snai1 was associated with decreased risk of lung cancer and COPD. The c.353C genotype weakened Snai1-induced expression of EMT markers and consistently decreased the probability of lung cancer metastasis at diagnosis, but other variants may increase the probability of subjects with COPD developing lung cancer ( 36 ). The study is important because germline variants are transmitted to offspring in humans.\nPatent Foramen Ovale and COPD\nShaikh and colleagues showed that a patent foramen ovale was of similar prevalence in patients with COPD and control subjects but that patent foramen ovale with large shunts was more frequent in patients with COPD than in control subjects (26 vs. 6%). There were no relationships in patients with COPD between patent foramen ovale and 6-minute-walk distance or exercise performance during a maximal exercise test. Thus, even where there are large shunts, patent foramen ovale closure is unlikely to improve exercise performance (3 7 ).\nImaging and Pathophysiology of COPD\nSection:\nSince 1995, the Gold Standard for assessing COPD severity has been FEV1. However, FEV1 does not allow us to capture the different phenotypes of COPD. For example, several studies have shown that although exacerbation frequency is correlated with FEV1, it is only weakly so ( 38 ). CT imaging is now being used successfully to differentiate the emphysematous from the bronchitic phenotype in COPD, and multidetector CT chest scanning has begun to examine the anatomy of small airways disease in COPD ( 38 ) and the pathobiology of COPD during occupational exposure ( 25 ) and has been shown to differentiate between different genotypes ( 25 , 29 ). The high cumulative radiation exposure associated with serial CT scanning is being mitigated by iterative reconstruction algorithms that allow a radiation dose reduction ranging from 20 to 80%. Future application in COPD will depend on use of gases with an unpaired proton: 19F, 129Xe, and 3He. The unpaired proton is polarized, which compensates for the low concentration in lung air spaces, allowing easy detection. Using these gases has allowed exploration of regional differences in ventilation within the lung in response to bronchodilator ( 38 ).\nPrevention Strategies and Comorbid Conditions in COPD\nSection:\nResearch Goals in the Prevention of COPD\nThe NHLBI is now set on reducing the mortality rate due to chronic respiratory disease. Key features of this approach would be a critical need for better definitions of lung health, preclinical states, and lung disease. Measures of lung health must extend beyond current physiologic tests and must lead to measures applicable to both the individual and the population as a whole ( 39 ). This approach will support the current thrust into personalized medicine for COPD ( 40 ) and will inform current trends in COPD research.\nSmoking Cessation and E-Cigarettes\nE-cigarettes are being championed in the lay press for their presumed safety and smoke-free properties ( 41 ). However, nicotine is produced by e-cigarettes, and nicotine is addictive and has been implicated in a number of cancers and been shown to provoke dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in the airway epithelium, leading to disruption of airway mucus transport ( 41 ).\nPrevention of Exacerbations\nMacrolides have been shown to reduce exacerbation frequencies. In a randomized controlled trial of azithromycin in COPD, azithromycin-treated patients with COPD had a reduced rate of exacerbations requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics compared with subjects receiving placebo ( 42 , 43 ). The azithromycin group was more likely have the less severe exacerbation (i.e., less need for intense therapy). Subgroup analyses showed that azithromycin may be more effective in older patients with COPD and in those in higher GOLD stages. Azithromycin (500 mg thrice weekly) was also found to achieve a 42% reduction in exacerbation rates among frequent exacerbators ( 44 ). Because frequent exacerbators are more likely to have rhinovirus infection ( 45 ), we speculate that the effects in frequent exacerbators shown above may be due to the previously proven protective effect of macrolides against rhinovirus infection. Acetylcysteine was also found to cause a 22% reduction in exacerbation frequency in moderate to severe COPD, and roflumilast was found to cause a 13% reduction in severe COPD with chronic bronchitis ( 46 , 47 ), but the anti–leukin-5 receptor-α monoclonal antibody benralizumab had no effect on exacerbations ( 48 ). Finally, a SNP related to proteinase-activated receptor-1 activity ( 49 ) and polymorphisms of the β-2 adrenergic receptor linked to salmeterol activity may protect against frequent exacerbations ( 50 )\nPrevention of Exacerbation Readmissions\nIn 2014, the U.S. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services expanded their Hospital Readmission Reduction Program to include COPD. This meant that readmission for a COPD exacerbation within 30 days would be met with reimbursement penalties ( 51 ). Thirty-day risk-adjusted readmission rates do not directly identify which components of hospital care need to be addressed; therefore, this initiative is unlikely to lead to improved COPD care ( 51 ).\nTherapeutics\nSection:\nWhich COPD Are We Treating?\nOne thousand patients from the U.S. COPD Outcomes-based Network for Clinical Effectiveness and Research Translation (CONCERT) DataHub were assessed using three COPD case definitions: ICD-9 codes, patient-reported physician diagnosis, and the clinical trial reference standard of obstructive spirometry with a history of smoking or alpha-1 AT deficiency ( 52 ). Only 42% of patients met all three criteria. In addition, only 57% of patients who met the ICD-9 definition also met the clinical trial reference standard. Further, only 61% of patients with self-reported COPD met the clinical trial standard, and thus epidemiologic studies that rely on patient-reported diagnosis of COPD may not accurately reflect the risk factors or prevalence of COPD ( 52 ) ( Figure 3 ). For example, the data from Denholm and colleagues would more likely fit the ICD-9 codes than the clinical trial standard ( 35 ). General Practice registers may be less efficient for recruitment of patients for COPD trials for these reasons ( 53 ). One study suggested enlarging the definition of chronic bronchitis to include that suggested by the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire because doing so identified patients with similar clinical features of more respiratory symptoms, exacerbation, worse lung function, and greater airway wall thickness ( 54 ). These studies raise the issue of a need for international standards for diagnosis and coding for COPD ( 55 ).\nFigure 3. Percentage of participants identified by each International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code (n = 909). Most patients (84%) had multiple encounters, and ICD-9 codes may have varied across these encounters. A total of 54% of patients were identified by more than one ICD-9 code and 17% by three or more ICD-9 codes. NOS = not otherwise specified. Reprinted by permission from Reference 52 .\n[More] [Minimize]\nUse of Systemic Steroids\nA retrospective database study of 17,239 patients reported that 33% of ICU admissions were treated with low-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone ≤240 mg/d) and that, compared with high doses, the low-dose patients had reductions in hospital and ICU length of stay, total hospital costs, length of invasive ventilation, need for insulin therapy, and rate of fungal infections (3.3 vs. 4.4%) ( 56 ). Although the study is of great interest, it should be interpreted with caution. However, it is the best that we have until a large, randomized, prospective study is performed and suggests that higher-dose systemic steroids are not safe in acute exacerbations of COPD ( 57 ).\nCessation of Inhaled Steroids in COPD\nMagnussen and colleagues showed that in patients on dual bronchodilator therapy, inhaled steroids may be safely withdrawn in severe COPD over an 18-week period without exacerbations. However, a 38-ml fall in FEV1 was observed over the last phase of withdrawal ( 58 ).\nHalting Progression to Pulmonary Hypertension\nThe phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor tadalafil, though useful in idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, had no effect on COPD-associated pulmonary hypertension ( 59 ). However, hope for treatment of this debilitating complication in COPD is not lost: Weissmann and colleagues showed that guanylate cyclase stimulator (sGC) may prevent pulmonary hypertension in COPD. They showed that treatment with two different sGCs prevented development of emphysema, pulmonary hypertension, and vascular remodeling in animals ( 60 ). It has previously been shown that vascular remodeling of pulmonary hypertension precedes alveolar destruction ( 61 ). Lesions in cyclic guanosine monophosphate–dependent pathways are important to the development of COPD and associated pulmonary hypertension and suggest that sGC stimulators may attenuate the course of COPD. The studies also showed that sGC may halt progression to pulmonary hypertension in smokers with COPD.\nConcluding Comments—The Future\nSection:\nIn 2014, the Journal published a sizable body of work on COPD. This work indicates a substantial emphasis on understanding the genetics of COPD and prevention of complications. Future strategies in COPD will share many common approaches to other chronic diseases as envisioned by the NHLBI, such as rigorous dissemination and implementation of research approaches to shorten the evidence-to-practice lag in clinical and public health settings, the use of novel multilevel strategies for improving care in underserved vulnerable communities, and the use of gene therapy and the implementation of electronic medical records to facilitate the delivery of personalized, predictive, and preemptive clinical care ( 39 ). However, COPD will demand certain strategies peculiar to the disease, such as newer antiinflammatory drugs that retard or restore lung function decline and prevent expression of the frequent exacerbator phenotype. The link between COPD and lung cancer now appears to have a genomic basis, but the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying this link need to be unraveled so that useful preventive strategies can be designed.\nReferences\nSection:\n1.\nJenne DE.

It is used for a wide range of purposes including communications, radio and television broadcasting, radio navigation, and sensing. Radar represents a fundamentally important use of the EM spectrum, in applications which include air traffic control, geophysical monitoring of Earth resources from space, automotive safety, severe weather tracking, and surveillance for defence and security.   Nearly all services have a need for greater bandwidth, which means that there will be ever greater competition for this finite resource. The paper explains the nature of the spectrum congestion problem from a radar perspective, and describes a number of possible approaches to its solution both from technical and regulatory points of view. These include improved transmitter spectral purity, passive radar, and intelligent, cognitive approaches that dynamically optimize spectrum use.\nPublication data is maintained in RPS.

The flexibility of an electric drivetrain would have a negative effect on the blended brake control performance. In this study, models of the powertrain system of an electric car equipped with an axle motor are developed. Based on these models, the transfer characteristics of the motor torque in the driveline and its effect on blended braking control performance are analysed. To further enhance a vehicle's brake performance and energy efficiency, blended braking control algorithms with compensation for the powertrain flexibility are proposed using an extended Kalman filter. These algorithms are simulated under normal deceleration braking. The results show that the brake performance and blended braking control accuracy of the vehicle are significantly enhanced by the newly proposed algorithms.\n""","1.0","""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00423114.2014.938663""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

(c) Correlation between obstacle fixations in the locomotion task and the responsiveness to obstacles during grasping. (d) Correlation between the movement durations in the locomotion and the grasping task. Note that two participants completed the locomotion task in less than 35 seconds.\nOur paradigm for measuring avoidance behaviour in a locomotion task is shown in Figure 1(b) . To test if individuals’ responsiveness to obstacles and the accompanying visuomotor adjustments are comparable across hand movement and locomotion tasks, we determined for each participant the extent to which each of them adjusted their movement paths to the obstacle’s position in the grasping task and correlated this measure with the percentage of time they spent looking at obstacles in the locomotion task. Remarkably, we found a strong correlation between the two measures, r(28) = .664, p < .001 (see Figure 2(c) ). Congruently, MDs in both obstacle avoidance tasks also correlated moderately, r(28) = .381, p = .046, indicating that participants who moved more slowly in the grasping task also took longer to navigate through the natural setting ( Figure 2(d) ). Note that there were, in fact, large inter-individual differences in how much time participants spent looking at obstacles during the locomotion task (from less than 1% of the movement time up to almost 20%) as well as in how long it took them to walk around the hallway (from just over 30 seconds up to about 1 minute 42 seconds).\nFinally, we were interested in whether there is a relationship between participants’ MD and their responsiveness to obstacles within the grasping and locomotion tasks. Such a relationship could indicate individual differences in balancing speed and accuracy in the task. We expected faster movements to be associated with more pronounced obstacle avoidance behaviour (indicated by a larger proportion of obstacle fixations and movement path adjustments, respectively) due to increased safety requirements. We found that in the locomotion task, MD correlated negatively with the percentage of obstacle fixations, r(28) = −.404, p = .03, indicating that participants who moved faster tended to spend proportionally more time looking at obstacles. However, contrary to our expectations, we observed no relationship between MDs and responsiveness to obstacles in the grasping task, r(28) = −.084, p = .67. This is, in so far, surprising as a larger deviation away from a straight-line movement path (i.e., increased responsiveness to obstacles) should actually increase the movement distance, thereby prolonging MDs in turn. However, we speculate that due to the relative short movement path in the grasping task, variations in MD might have been too small to detect a reliable effect.\nDiscussion\nSection:\nThis study aimed to explore whether variations in visuomotor behaviour in response to obstacles during locomotion and grasping tasks are associated on an intra-individual basis. Our results suggest that while individuals strongly differ from one another in the magnitude of their behavioural response when confronted with obstacles, they show high intra-individual consistency in their visuomotor adjustments across different tasks and measures. We found a strong positive correlation between responsiveness to obstacles in grasping and obstacle fixations during locomotion. This implies that there are intra-individual differences in cautiousness with which participants plan and execute their movements which, in turn, may determine how much attentional weight individuals give to obstacles in their environment. In line with this argument, a recent study has shown that allocating more attention to obstacles (i.e., by flashing them) increases the strength of the avoidance responses ( Menger et al., 2015 ).\nWhile this is the first study that combines two quite distinct obstacle avoidance paradigms (i.e., grasping and locomotion tasks) in order to establish if participants show consistent levels of responsiveness to obstacles, both paradigms have been frequently employed previously in isolation (e.g., Chapman & Goodale, 2008 ; Menger, Van der Stigchel, & Dijkerman, 2012 ; Patla, 1997 ; Patla et al., 2007 ; Rosenbaum et al., 1999 ; Ross et al., 2014 ). Importantly, most of our results are well in line with previous observations such as participants adjusting their hand movements in response to obstacle position during grasping, and spending a considerable amount of time looking at obstacles prior to passing them during locomotion. Despite the similarities to earlier studies, there are also a few inconsistencies that need to be addressed.\nFirst, we had predicted that participants will show greater deviations away from an obstacle during grasping if there are increased negative consequences associated with a potential collision. Evidence for this suggestion comes from a study by De Haan et al. (2014) who found that participants kept a larger distance from a full water glass as compared with an empty one in order to minimise the risk of spillage when performing hand movements. In our study, we used two different kinds of glasses that can be considered as being more or less fragile (martini vs. lager glass). Collision with a fragile glass can be deemed as being more dangerous as it is more likely to result in breakage. In contrast to this prediction, we found similar movement paths for both types of glasses. However, before concluding that perceived fragility of an obstacle had no effect on avoidance behaviour, we have to take into account that while we kept the maximum diameter of the two glasses constant, the Y-shape of the martini glass provided considerably more room for passing it when reaching for the target than the wider body of the lager glass (see Figure 1(a) ). Hence, it seems almost surprising that participants still kept a similar distance from the martini glass as from the lager glass as this essentially means that there was a larger distance between the hand and the stem of the glass. Furthermore, in line with the idea that the martini glass is considered as the more dangerous (i.e., breakable) obstacle, we found that participants performed slower movements when it was placed in the workspace. This supports the findings of earlier studies showing that MDs get prolonged as obstacles become more obstructive and accuracy demands increase ( Tresilian, 1998 ).\nSecond, with regard to locomotion task, one might wonder why we observed seemingly fewer and/or shorter fixations on obstacles as compared with previous studies (e.g., Hayhoe et al., 2009 ; Patla et al., 2007 ). Again, this can almost certainly be attributed to the differences in the task settings used in our experiment as compared with previous studies. For instance, in the locomotion study investigating participants’ gaze behaviour when navigating around obstacles, Patla et al. (2007) placed 12 obstacles (i.e., traffic pylons) in an area measuring about 4.5 × 3.2 m (resulting in walking path lengths of about 5–6 m). Other studies made the obstacles more obstructive, thereby requiring participants to actively avoid them by stepping over them (e.g., Hayhoe et al., 2009 ; Patla & Vickers, 1997 ). In contrast, in our experiment, participants walked a comparatively long path (about 65 m) in which we only placed a few obstacles. Hence, they spent overall a smaller percentage of their time looking at the obstacles. Using this less obvious obstacle avoidance setup in our experiment had, in fact, an advantage as our participants were actually unaware that we were interested in their obstacle avoidance performance (rather than in their navigation performance), thereby allowing us to measure more natural avoidance behaviour in this situation. Furthermore, Rothkopf, Ballard, and Hayhoe (2007) used a similar walking task within a virtual environment (40 m length, 1.8 m width) and showed that fixation patterns also strongly depend on the task instructions. That is, their participants spent a considerably smaller proportion of time fixating at obstacles placed in the walkway if they were instructed to pick up litter as compared with conditions in which they received explicit instruction on avoiding obstacles. Hence, the small percentage of obstacle fixations observed in our study might also be partly due to the fact that we did not mention obstacles at all in our task instruction.\nIn summary, we suggest that our grasping and locomotion paradigms allowed us to measure typical visuomotor adjustments when movements are challenged by obstacles—and that the extent of these adjustments may reflect the general tendency of an individual to perform safe actions. Specifically, our study provides first tentative evidence that participants who show larger avoidance responses in a simple grasping task also tend to allocate more attention to obstacles (as measured by gaze behaviour) in a more natural locomotion task. Based on these findings, one could speculate that inter-individual differences in obstacle avoidance behaviour may be the reason why some people bump into objects or knock their drinks over more frequently than others.\nMethod\nSection:\nParticipants\nThirty participants with normal or corrected-to-normal vision gave informed consent prior to participating in the experiment that was approved by the Psychology Ethics Committee at Aberdeen University. Two participants were excluded from the analysis due to missing data in the video files from the locomotion task resulting in a total number of 28 participants (9 men, 18–36 years).\nSetup, Stimuli, and Procedure\nIn the grasping task, participants sat in a high-adjustable chair in front of a table on which the target object (a yellow cylinder with a height and width of 55 mm) and one of the obstacles (martini glass [fragile obstacle] vs. lager glass [fragile obstacle]; see Figure 1(a) ) were placed. Participants’ hand movements were measured at 240 Hz with a TrakStar motion tracker (Northern Digital). Two markers were attached to the tip of the index finger and the tip of the thumb of the participants’ dominant hand. Participants wore liquid-crystal shutter glasses (Translucent Technologies, Milgram, 1987 ) to occlude vision during the time the experimenter arranged the objects on the table. In each trial, an obstacle was placed either 10 cm to the left or right of the movement path (i.e., straight-line distance of 30 cm between the start position and the target object). Once the obstacles were arranged in the workspace, the experimenter started each trial manually with a key press. At the start of the trial, the shutter glasses opened. Following a preview period of 1 seconds, an auditory go-signal was presented in response to which participants had to reach out, grasp the target object, and place it anywhere on the table. Participants had full visibility during movement execution (for 2 seconds after the go-signal) while shutter glasses were closed between trials to allow the experimenter to prepare the next trial. Each combination of obstacle position (left vs. right) and obstacle type (martini vs. lager glass) was tested 20 times in random order resulting in a total of 80 grasping trials.\nIn the locomotion task, the experimenter asked the participant to walk down a hallway into a kitchen area, get a coffee mug placed opposite to the sink and return it to the lab. Several obstacles were placed along the way (two chairs and a step ladder) and in the kitchen (a cactus) but were not noted in the instruction (see Figure 1(b) ). Instead, the task was disguised as a brief pilot test for memory and navigation skills. Participants’ eye movements were tracked with SMI glasses (SensoMotoric Instruments) that recorded gaze at a sampling rate of 60 Hz with a spatial resolution of 0.1° and an accuracy of 0.5°. Furthermore, the surrounding was recorded via a scene camera at a rate of 24 Hz and with a resolution of 1280 × 960 pixels. Participants were informed about the scene camera but remained unaware of their eye movements being recorded. They were fully debriefed afterwards and were offered the possibility to withdraw their data. Grasping and locomotion tasks were counterbalanced across participants.\nData Analysis\nIn the grasping task, we were primarily interested in participants’ overall movement times, the lateral hand positions when passing the obstacle, and their overall responsiveness to obstacle position. Movement onset was defined as the moment in time at which one of the finger markers (index finger or thumb) exceeded a velocity threshold of 0.05 mm/ms. Movement offset was determined by using a combination of a spatial criterion and a velocity threshold. Specifically, we first determined the largest distance in y direction of the index finger marker during the trial and then searched for the frame with the lowest velocity of both markers ±24 frames (100 ms) from when the hand had reached this position. MD was defined as the time between movement onset and movement offset. MDs that were longer or shorter than each participant’s mean value ±2.5 standard deviations were considered outliers and removed from the analysis. Hand position during grasping was calculated as the virtual midpoint of the position of the thumb and index finger markers in three-dimensional space. From this data, we determined participants’ lateral hand position (x direction) at the moment the obstacle was passed (i.e., the moment the virtual midpoint reached the y position at which the obstacle was placed). Based on this, we further calculated the overall responsiveness to obstacles by determining the average difference between the lateral hand position when the obstacle was placed either left or right of the midline.\nFor the locomotion task, we determined how long it took participants to complete the task and how much time they spent looking at the four different obstacles. In this task, MD was defined as the time between leaving the lab until entering back in, and the responsiveness to obstacles was defined as the cumulative obstacle fixation duration. Obstacle fixations were obtained using a frame by frame analysis of the video clips showing both the video recording overlaid with participants’ gaze positions (using the BeGaze™ software) and are reported as the percentage of the overall MD.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Jutta Billino was supported by grants from the German Research Foundation, Collaborative Research Centre SFB/TRR 135: Cardinal Mechanisms of Perception.\nReferences\nSection:\nChapman C.

This edition presents six papers covering important theoretical and practical aspects of transportation engineering. On behalf of the editorial board, I thank the authors for their hard work and valuable contributions to the journal. I would also like to extend my appreciation to our esteemed reviewers for their invaluable support.\nTransport networks are one of the most important national assets. Economic prosperity, rapid urbanisation, increasing traffic and ageing infrastructures all have immense impact on safe and efficient operation of this vital asset. Some of these factors are addressed in this issue.\nThe first paper ( Appiah et al., 2016 ) deals with truck characteristics in traffic micro-simulation. The authors present an approach to incorporating the operating characteristics of a local truck fleet in the calibration of micro-simulation models. This approach is different from conventional model calibration where focus is given to adjusting the parameters of driving behaviour logic. The second paper ( Mohapatra et al., 2016 ) reports the influence of conflicting traffic on U-turns at uncontrolled median openings under mixed traffic conditions in an Indian context. With rapid urbanisation and increased traffic volume, most urban roads in India are constructed as multi-lane roads, while many existing two-lane roads are also being widened to multi-lane roads. These multi-lane roads are generally constructed with a raised median, in order to segregate the opposing traffic movements. The authors showed that the impact of conflicting traffic is greater on four-lane roads compared to six-lane roads. In the third paper ( Zong et al., 2016 ), the authors present a model for investigating the feasibility of an integrated transportation demand management (TDM) programme in the Nanhai district of China to mitigate the traffic congestion and reduce exhaust gas emission from motor vehicles. The TDM programme includes a bus priority policy, a motorcycle restriction policy and a congestion pricing policy. The authors demonstrate that all three policies would have a positive effect on Nanhai's transport system. All three papers address key transport issues which traffic engineers and researchers will find very useful.\nIn recent years, railway industries have faced a massive demand for increasing train speeds. However, switch and turnout parts of the track are two critical parts where speed reduction is necessary. In order to develop a more efficient system, the fourth paper ( Sadeghi et al., 2016 ) presents a mathematical model of the impact of railway geometry on the safety of train running and permissible speed. The model is based on the railway vehicle and track parameters such as curve radius, switch initial angle and track gauge with running speed. The model accuracy is verified in field trials. This paper is a good example of how theoretical modelling could help to solve practical issues.\nThe fifth and sixth papers address concrete pavement rehabilitation. The fifth paper ( Lu and Rong, 2016 ), presents the impact of gradation on rubblised Portland cement concrete pavement. Rubblisation is a popular technique for upgrading severely deteriorated concrete pavement. Many previous studies have shown that rubblised concrete with a hot-mix asphalt (HMA) overlay improves pavement performance, especially its cracking resistance. The authors present two studies and demonstrate that if the rubblised gradation matches the requirement for the crushed stone base of the flexible pavement, tensile strains at the HMA overlay bottom develop at a slower pace, indicating an improvement in deterioration resistance (namely cracking) of the overlay system. This article should be a good resource for practitioners and researchers alike. The final paper ( Gao, 2016 ), presents a mathematical model for evaluating the impact of top-down surface cracking in concrete pavement. Surface cracks of concrete pavement not only impact safety and ride quality, but also reduce service life. The author shows that crack length and load position significantly influence the stress intensity factors, and that stress intensity factors are less affected by the elastic modulus of the pavement material than might be expected. Observing that studies on the mechanism of crack propagation in a cement concrete pavement are rather limited, this paper should serve to enhance current knowledge in this field.\nWe trust you find these papers useful and rewarding to read. Comments on this issue or on general journal-related matters will be received with great interest.\nReferences\n""","0.64696985","""http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/10.1680/jtran.2016.169.4.185""","[-0.472855,51.532848]"

Reduced speeds should therefore lead to casualty reduction, and automatic speed cameras were introduced in England and Wales under the Road Traffic Act 1991 to help achieve this aim. A quasi-experimental study is described that assessed die impact of several kinds of speed camera deployment strategy in England on different types of driver. Twelve surveys were carried out in five police force areas, and more than 6800 drivels participated. While all modes of camera deployment led to lower speeds, driver types who ‘manipulated’ or ‘defied’ the cameras were least responsive to and respectful of than. Conversely, those who described themselves as ‘conforming’ to speed limits or ‘deterred’ by cameras approved of them most. Background characteristics of driver types, their perceptions of camera operation and behavioural responses to cameras arc discussed. The implications for speed limit enforcement and casualty reduction are considered in light of the findings.\n""","0.5218565","""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10683160008409809""","[-0.472855,51.532848]"

Limited evidence suggests that exposure to air pollutants from indoor biomass combustion may be associated with elevated blood pressure (BP).\nObjective: Our aim was to assess the relationship between air pollution exposure from indoor biomass combustion and BP in women in rural China.\nMethods: We measured 24-hr personal integrated gravimetric exposure to fine particles < 2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) and systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) in the winter and summer among 280 women ≥ 25 years of age living in rural households using biomass fuels in Yunnan, China. We investigated the association between PM2.5 exposure and SBP and DBP using mixed-effects models with random intercepts to account for correlation among repeated measures.\nResults: Personal average 24-hr exposure to PM2.5 ranged from 22 to 634 µg/m3 in winter and from 9 to 492 µg/m3 in summer. A 1-log-µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure was associated with 2.2 mm Hg higher SBP [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.8 to 3.7; p = 0.003] and 0.5 mm Hg higher DBP (95% CI, –0.4 to 1.3; p = 0.31) among all women; estimated effects varied by age group. Among women > 50 years of age, a 1-log-µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure was associated with 4.1 mm Hg higher SBP (95% CI, 1.5 to 6.6; p = 0.002) and 1.8 mm Hg higher DBP (95% CI, 0.4 to 3.2; p = 0.01). PM2.5 exposure was positively associated with SBP among younger women, but the association was not statistically significant.\nConclusion: PM2.5 exposure from biomass combustion may be a risk factor for elevated BP and hence for cardiovascular events. Our findings should be corroborated in longitudinal studies.\n[/do][do action=”abstract”]Key words: biomass, blood pressure, cardiovascular health, China, household air pollution, indoor air pollution, particulate matter, solid fuels[/do]\n[do action=”notes-rule-above”]Address correspondence to J.

Several mechanisms have been proposed for these cardiovascular effects, including PM-induced increases in blood pressure (BP) ( Pope et al. 2004 ). Human experiments ( Brook et al. 2009 ; Langrish et al. 2009 ; Urch et al. 2005 ) and observational studies ( Auchincloss et al. 2008 ; Brook et al. 2011 ; Choi et al. 2007 ; Delfino et al. 2010 ; Dvonch et al. 2009 ; Ibald-Mulli et al. 2001 ; Kannan et al. 2010 ; Linn et al. 1999 ; Liu et al. 2009 ; Zanobetti et al. 2004 ) suggest that ambient air pollution exposure could raise systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), although other studies failed to replicate these findings ( Brauer et al. 2001 ; Ebelt et al. 2005 ; Harrabi et al. 2006 ; Ibald-Mulli et al. 2004 ; Jansen et al. 2005 ; Madsen and Nafstad 2006 ).\nAlthough ambient PM studies combined with toxicological studies of woodsmoke exposure ( Naeher et al. 2007 ) suggest a potential role of indoor air pollution in BP elevation, there are limited epidemiologic data in support of this hypothesis. Only a randomized intervention study in Guatemalan women demonstrated that transitioning from an open fire to an improved biomass stove was associated with lower BP ( McCracken et al. 2007 ). The lack of epidemiologic data on the cardiovascular health effects of indoor air pollution limits our ability to assess its full public health impact ( Smith and Peel 2010 ). For example, the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) Comparative Risk Assessment did not attribute cardiovascular outcomes to household use of solid fuels (WHO 2009).\nIn the present study we assessed the relationship between personal exposure to PM from biomass combustion and BP in women in rural China. Our study is particularly relevant to China, which has low incidence of ischemic stroke but high incidence of hemorrhagic stroke relative to other regions ( Zhang et al. 2003 ).\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy location and population. The study took place in six villages in northwestern Yunnan province, China (N 26°52´, E 100°06´). Most participants are members of the Naxi minority group and have similar socioeconomic backgrounds and dietary habits. All households used biomass for cooking or heating. Ninety-four percent of households used biomass as their primary cooking fuel, but all also used at least one “improved” fuel (liquefied petroleum gas, biogas, or electricity). Space heating with wood logs or wood charcoal is common during winter (98% of households).\nParticipant recruitment. We recruited 280 women from 235 rural households. Women who were current or former cigarette smokers or pregnant at the time of the study were excluded. Local field staff explained the objectives and methods of the study to village women’s groups and identified eligible participants with assistance from village leaders. Women interested in participation were read a consent form by field staff, and all provided oral informed consent. The study was approved by the Health Sciences Institutional Review Board at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Yunnan Provincial Health Bureau, Kunming, China. Data collection took place in winter (December 2008–February 2009) and summer (June–August 2009).\nPersonal PM2.5 exposure measurement. We measured 24-hr personal integrated gravimetric exposure to fine particles < 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) in winter and summer. PM2.5 is widely considered the best indicator of adverse health effects from combustion-related pollution ( Pope and Dockery 2006 ). Sampling occurred every day of the week, except holidays when cooking periods are unusually long and hence an inappropriate measure of usual exposure. In each season, approximately 10% of participants were randomly selected for 24-hr measurements of PM2.5 exposure on 2 consecutive days to assess day-to-day exposure variation.\nParticipants wore a portable, battery-operated pump (Apex Pro; Casella CEL, Bedford, UK) in a small waistpack (< 1 kg) for gravimetric PM2.5 measurements. Field staff instructed participants to perform routine daily activities and wear the waistpack at all times. However, they could place the waistpack within 1 m while resting or sleeping and within 2 m during activities when wearing it was very inconvenient or impossible (i.e., bathing). To monitor compliance, field staff conducted daily visits to participants’ homes and attached pedometers to the waistpacks.\nThe pump was connected to a Slaton aluminum cassette (BGI Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) loaded with a 37-mm Teflon filter (2.0-μm pore size; SKC Inc., Eighty Four, PA, USA) and attached downstream from a GK2.05 (KTL) cyclone with a 2.5-µm aerodynamic-diameter cut point (BGI Inc.) when operated at 4 L/min ± 10%. The air-flow rate through the filters was measured at the beginning and end of each sampling period using a calibrated rotameter. Because of the high altitude of the study site, we corrected for atmospheric pressure changes during rotameter calibration in Madison, Wisconsin ( Caplan 1985 ).\nThe Teflon filters were weighed pre- and postsampling at the Wisconsin State Hygiene Laboratory after being conditioned in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment (23°C and 40%) for at least 24 hr and were statically discharged using a polonium source. We weighed each filter in triplicate using a microbalance (MX-5; Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH, USA) with a readability of 1 μg. If the initial three weights differed by > 5 μg (2% of filters), we reweighed the filter until a stable weight was achieved. The average of the three closest weights was used as the final weight for analysis. The zero and span of the balance were checked after every batch of 20 samples.\nFor quality control and to assess potential contamination, 10% field blank filters were placed in identical cassettes, subject to the same field conditions, and analyzed using the same protocol as the sample filters. We performed blank correction by subtracting the median mass of field blanks collected seasonally in each village and obtained the mass concentration by dividing the blank-corrected-mass by the corresponding Teflon filter sample volume. The mean mass of blanks was 0.72 µg [95% confidence interval (CI), –2.3 to 3.78]. All pump flow rates were ± 8% of the target and 90% of samples ran within 2 hr of the target 24-hr sampling period. Of the 652 PM samples collected, we excluded five from the analysis because of equipment failure or filter damage.\nBP measurements. We conducted home BP measurements immediately before and after each participant’s PM2.5 personal exposure monitoring period using an automated device (Omron-705CP; Omron Corp, Tokyo, Japan), that has been validated against a mercury sphygmomanometer according to the revised protocol of the British Hypertension Society ( O’Brien et al. 1996 ). The mean and median times between PM monitoring completion and BP measurement were 15 min and 6 min, respectively. After ≥ 5 min of quiet rest, three consecutive BP measures were taken 1 min apart on the supported right arm of the seated participant in accordance with standard recommendations ( Pickering et al. 2005 ). We also recorded the date, time, and ambient air temperature and whether the participant had consumed caffeine in the previous hour. The average of the last two BP measures was used as the subject’s final BP estimate. Women with average SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg or using antihypertensive medication were considered hypertensive.\nQuestionnaires and other measurements. We collected sociodemographic and health information for each participant: age, education, current medication use, and cardiovascular history, including physician-diagnosed diabetes, kidney disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hypertension. We asked participants if they had experienced difficulty in carrying out daily activities or work because of illness in the past 3 months and to describe their health compared with women of similar age (categorized as excellent, good, fair, or poor). Passive smoking status was obtained by asking about the number of active smokers in the participant’s household and the average number of cigarettes smoked per day by each smoker. We assigned a composite socioeconomic status (SES) score to each household, which was constructed from data on the ownership of 17 household assets using principal components analysis ( Filmer and Pritchett 2001 ). In developing countries, asset-based measures of SES are considered more robust and less-biased indicators of long-term economic status than self-reported income or consumption of goods ( Sahn and Stifel 2003 ).\nFor each participant, we measured height (centimeters), weight (kilograms), and waist circumference (centimeters) and calculated body mass index (BMI) by dividing weight (kilograms) by height (meters squared). Physical activity was assessed by using both 24-hr pedometer measurement and estimation of the time per week engaged in different activity levels using the WHO Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (WHO 2006). Using these activities, we calculated a weekly metabolic equivalent task score for each participant. The validity of this questionnaire in assessing physical activity in rural populations in developing countries is described elsewhere ( Bull et al. 2009 ). Finally, we estimated individual 24-hr salt intake by weighing the salt container of each household before and after a 24-hr period, taking the difference between the two measures, and dividing it by the number of residents in the household.\nAnalysis of PM–BP association. We log-transformed PM2.5 concentrations to improve normality and variance homogeneity, supported by evidence suggesting a log-linear exposure–response relationship between PM and cardiovascular outcomes ( Pope et al. 2009 ). In the first analysis, we used mixed-effects models with random intercepts at the individual, household, and village level to assess the independent effect of PM2.5 exposure on BP and adjust for time-invariant factors in the same individual, within participants in the same household, and within the same village ( Laird and Ware 1982 ). Individual-level random effect estimates accounted for measurements in two seasons. Within each season, we used the first observation for individuals with repeated measurements, because only a subset of participants had repeated within-season measurements. We analyzed the effect of PM2.5 exposure on both postexposure BP and average pre- and postexposure BP in separate regression models.\nWe estimated the following regression equation:\nγifkj = µ + β̂1ln(PM2.5)ifkj + γxifkj + ηzifk + αifk + hfk + νk + εij, [1]\nwhere y denotes either SBP or DBP in individual i, in household f, in village k, in season j; μ represents a constant; β̂11n(PM2.5) is the effect size estimate per ln(PM2.5) exposure; γxifkj represents the time-varying covariates (i.e., day and time of BP measurement, ambient air temperature, physical activity, caffeine intake, and self-reported health); ηzifk denotes covariates that are time-invariant or that changed only minimally during the study period (i.e., age, years of education, waist circumference, SES, salt intake, passive smoking); αifk represents the random intercept with the distribution ~ n(0,σa2); hfk represents the random effects at the household level with the distribution ~ n(0,σh2); νk represents the random effects at the village level with the distribution ~ n(0,σv2); and εij is the error term with the distribution ~ n(0,σ2).\nWe retained variables in the final model if they were associated with BP at p < 0.10 or if they changed the effect of PM exposure on BP by ≥ 10%. We also assessed effect size modification by age, BMI dichotomized as obese or overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) versus normal weight or underweight (BMI < 25 kg/m2), hypertension status, and passive smoking by including the interaction between personal PM exposure and the potential effect modifier in the mixed-effects models. If the interaction was statistically significant (p < 0.05), we conducted separate analyses corresponding with each group.\nFinally, we used our estimated mixed-effects log-linear regression models to predict the average SBP and DBP in the population (i.e., marginal means). For this purpose, all covariates in the models were kept at their average value except for PM2.5 exposure, which was allowed to vary within the exposure range that we observed in our study population ( StataCorp 2009 ).\nIn a second analysis, we took advantage of the within-season repeated PM2.5 measurements in about 10% of participants to account for the day-to-day variability in exposure. For this purpose, we used a covariate measurement error (CME) model ( Rabe-Hesketh et al. 2003 ). The CME model predicts an individual’s corrected usual exposure from a mixed-effects model and then uses the corrected exposure value in a multivariate regression model. Participants with only one PM2.5 value still contribute to the analysis, under the assumption that the sample with repeated exposure measurements was drawn at random (i.e., that repeated measures of PM2.5 are missing at random). For the CME analysis, we used a “wrapper” command that uses the adaptive quadrature method implemented through the “gllamm” command ( Rabe-Hesketh et al. 2002 ).\nAll statistical analyses were performed in STATA 11 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).\nResults\nWe enrolled 280 women 25–90 years of age (mean age, 51.9 years). Of these, 196 participated in both the winter and summer, 66 only in the winter, and 18 only in the summer. Most declines to participate in both evaluations were due to the farming season schedule. Most participants had some form of formal education (52% primary and 31% secondary school). The mean (± SD) BMI and waist circumference among participants were 23 ± 4 kg/m2 and 82 ± 9 cm, respectively. Seventeen percent were overweight (BMI, 25–29.9 kg/m2), and 4% were obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2).\nPersonal 24-hr exposure to PM2.5 ranged from 9 to 492 µg/m3 [interquartile range (IQR), 61 µg/m3; median, 52 µg/m3] in summer and 22 to 634 µg/m3 (IQR, 120 µg/m3; median, 105 µg/m3) in winter. The 24-hr geometric mean PM2.5 exposure in summer was 55 µg/m3 (95% CI, 49 to 62) and increased to 117 µg/m3 (95% CI, 107 to 128) in winter.\nNone of the participants reported kidney disease, a previous myocardial infarction, or stroke, and < 1% (n = 2) had physician-diagnosed diabetes. Mean SBP and DBP were 120 (95% CI, 118 to 122) and 72 mm Hg (95% CI, 71 to 73), respectively. Thirteen percent (n = 37) of participants were hypertensive; 78% (n = 29) of hypertensive women were unaware of their status, and only 17% (n = 6) were taking antihypertensive medication. Among women with measurements in both seasons, SBP was significantly higher in winter than in summer (120 mm Hg; 95% CI, 117 to 122 vs. 116 mm Hg; 95% CI, 113 to 118; p < 0.001), with no seasonal difference in DBP (73 mm Hg; 95% CI, 71 to 74 vs. 73 mm Hg; 95% CI, 71 to 74; p = 90). Similar to observations in other populations ( Lawes et al. 2004 ), SBP increased with age, whereas DBP increased until approximately 60 years of age and then slightly decreased thereafter.\nPM–BP associations. Personal PM2.5 exposure was positively associated with postexposure measurement of SBP and DBP ( Table 1 ). A 1-log-µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure was associated with 2.2 mm Hg higher SBP (95% CI, 0.8 to 3.7; p = 0.003) and 0.5 mm Hg higher DBP (95% CI, –0.4 to 1.3; p = 0.31) among all women; however, the estimated effect was dependent on age. We observed evidence of an age-by-exposure interaction using 10-year age groups but lacked sufficient statistical power to estimate effects with reasonable precision. We therefore dichotomized age as 25–50 years and > 50 years based on biological parameters and the relative increase in cardiovascular risk beginning in the fifth decade of life ( Mackay and Mensa 2004 ). The PM–BP associations were not significantly modified by BMI, hypertension status, or passive smoking.\nDownload larger image (TIF File)\nIn the crude analysis, a 1-log-µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure was associated with 2.7 mm Hg higher SBP; (95% CI, 1.4 to 4.1; p < 0.001); the effect was larger in women > 50 years of age (4.1 mm Hg; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.5; p = 0.001) than in women 25–50 years of age (1.6 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.4 to 2.8; p = 0.008) ( Table 1 ). This pattern of a stronger association in older women persisted after adjusting for other risk factors, but after adjustment the association was no longer significant in younger women (0.7 mm Hg; p = 0.35). The interaction between PM2.5 and age group on SBP was statistically significant (p = 0.03).\nWe observed similar results for DBP, with both crude and adjusted estimates indicating a nonsignificant effect of PM2.5 among young women and significantly higher DBP among older women ( Table 1 ). After adjusting for other variables, a 1-log-µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure was associated with 1.8 mm Hg higher DBP in women > 50 years of age (p = 0.01). The interaction between PM2.5 and age group was also significant for DBP (p = 0.01).\nAn average woman > 50 years of age exposed to the average PM2.5 level in our study population (~ 100 µg/m3) had an estimated SBP and DBP of 128 and 76 mm Hg, respectively ( Figure 1 ). However, if the same woman was exposed to PM2.5 concentrations in the upper decile of our exposure distribution (~ 500 µg/m3), her estimated SBP and DBP increased to 135 and 79 mm Hg, respectively.\nDownload larger image (TIF File)\nOur findings did not change when we used average BP (i.e., the mean of the before and after exposure measurements of BP) as the dependent variable or when we excluded women with diabetes (n = 2) or those who were potentially noncompliant (waistpack pedometer < 500; n = 12) from the analysis (results not reported).\nUsing the CEM model to account for day-to-day variability in PM2.5 exposure, the estimated effect of a 1-log-µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure on SBP decreased from 4.1 to 2.1 mm Hg in women > 50 years of age but remained statistically significant (95% CI, 1.9 to 2.9; p < 0.001; Table 2 ). In contrast, the effect estimate for DBP in older women remained roughly the same (2.3 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.0 to 4.7; p = 0.05). The effect estimates for SBP and DBP increased considerably among younger women but remained nonsignificant.\nDownload larger image (TIF File)\nDiscussion\nUsing data on both personal exposure to PM2.5 and BP measurements in two seasons, we found a significant positive association between increased exposure to PM2.5 and both SBP and DBP. A 1-log-µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure was associated with 4.1 mm Hg higher SBP (95% CI, 1.5 to 6.6) and 1.8 mm Hg higher DBP (95% CI, 0.4 to 3.2) in women > 50 years of age. PM2.5 exposure was positively associated with SBP among younger women, but the association was not statistically significant. Our results are consistent with a previous epidemiologic study on indoor biomass smoke and BP ( McCracken et al. 2007 ), which found that use of improved cooking stoves, resulting in lower PM exposure, was associated with 3.7 mm Hg lower SBP (p = 0.10) and 3.0 mm Hg lower DBP (p = 0.02) relative to a traditional open-fire control group. Further, in our study we had personal PM exposure data and could thus estimate the exposure–response relationship.\nSeveral studies on ambient air pollution have also shown an association between PM2.5 and BP. However, in those studies PM2.5 likely originated from sources other than biomass combustion, and the PM exposure levels were considerably lower than in our study. Among the few studies with personal PM2.5 exposure measurement, Liu et al. (2009) found a 3.7-mm Hg (95% CI, 0.6 to 6.7) increase in SBP per 7.1-µg/m3 increase in PM exposure in elderly subjects, and Brook et al. (2010) observed a 1.4-mm Hg (95% CI, 0.8 to 2.1) elevation in SBP per 10-µg/m3 increase in PM exposure in a community sample of adults. The SBP effects observed in those studies were roughly comparable to those estimated for older women in our study. Other studies with ambient or household PM exposure measurements found that PM2.5 was positively associated with higher BP across 1- to 2-day time lags ( Dvonch et al. 2009 ; Kannan et al. 2010 ; Lin et al. 2009 ), but the PM effect was stronger than the one observed in our study.\nThe notable strengths of our study include measurment of personal exposure, data on exposure and BP collected in summer and winter, and adjustment for important risk factors for increased BP including age, obesity, physical activity, and salt intake. Although our method of estimating salt intake has not been validated previously and was measured at the household level, it was selected based on the local logistical and cultural context. Specifically, measurement of urinary sodium was logistically impossible, and we are not aware of a previously validated food frequency questionnaire for a rural Naxi population. Residual confounding for salt intake or other covariates may remain. However, it is unlikely that these or other unmeasured covariates are strong confounders in our mixed-effects models, given the relative homogenous distribution of risk factors for elevated BP in our study population, which facilitates control of unmeasurable or difficult-to-measure risk factors.\nWe used 24-hr PM2.5 exposure measurement because data on longer-term seasonal exposure were not feasible given resource and time constraints. However, our overall conclusions about the PM–BP relationship were robust after accounting for day-to-day variation in PM2.5 exposure based on repeated 24-hr exposure measurements. Field staff did not observe any instances where wearing the waistpack impeded the normal physical activity of the participant; however, we cannot completely eliminate the possibility. Technologies that can more easily measure long-term PM exposure would greatly benefit epidemiologic research on indoor air pollution and health.\nAn important limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design. Cooking with biomass is a long-term behavior; thus, 24-hr PM exposure is a measure that is usual except for day-to-day variability. In addition, an individual’s BP is not likely to affect PM exposure, given that increases in BP are usually asymptomatic. Although some occult cardiac disease may exist in our study population, it is unlikely that asymptomatic conditions would influence exposure to PM. It is possible that poor health status, some of which may be attributable to undiagnosed cardiovascular comorbidities, may lead women to reduce their PM exposure. However, adjusting for self-reported health status in the regression models did not alter our findings. Similarly, unreported use of medications such as oral contraceptives or antidepressants cannot explain our findings, because their use is extremely rare in this population ( Hardee et al. 2004 ; Parker et al. 2001 ).\nIn our mixed-effects models, 24-hr pedometer measurement was the only marker of physical activity associated with BP. Travel between households, agricultural fields, and the local market often involves walking alongside the major highway running through the study site and may increase exposure to traffic emissions. Therefore, number of pedometer steps may be a marker of physical activity and/or exposure to traffic pollution in our study. Similarly, our use of personal PM2.5 mass prevents us from studying the relative contribution of different PM constituents or sources on the observed BP effects.\nIn addition, although our use of 24-hr average personal PM exposure provides a more useful exposure profile than household or proxy measurements (i.e., cooking frequency or primary fuel type) for epidemiologic analysis, it does not account for high-intensity pollution exposure periods that may occur, for instance, while cooking or starting a fire. As previously hypothesized ( Ezzati et al. 2000 ), this may systematically underestimate exposure for some women. However, if high- intensity exposure positively modifies the effect of PM exposure on BP, our findings would underestimate the health effects in the overall population using biomass fuels.\nPrevious studies indicate that transitioning from an open fire to an improved (i.e., enclosed and vented) wood cookstove ( Albalak et al. 2001 ), liquefied petroleum gas ( Naeher et al. 2000 ), or wood charcoal ( Ezzati and Kammen 2002 ) can result in at least a 1-log-µg/m3 reduction in indoor PM. Based on our results, such a change could result in approximately 4 mm Hg lower SBP among older women. Strong evidence suggests that risk of cardiovascular mortality increases progressively and linearly with increasing BP at levels as low as 115 mm Hg SBP and 75 mm Hg DBP in Western and Asian populations ( Lawes et al. 2004 ; Lewington et al. 2002 ). Based on results from Lawes et al. (2003) , we estimate that 4 mm Hg lower SBP on a population level would result in an 18% (95% CI, 15 to 21) decrease in coronary heart disease and a 22% (95% CI, 21 to 24) decrease in stroke among Asian women 50–59 years of age. Considering that biomass fuels are the primary domestic energy source for > 2 billion people globally ( Smith et al. 2004 ), the potential cardiovascular benefit of transitioning to cleaner-burning stoves and fuels on a macro level would be considerable. For example, based on the published mortality data for Chinese women, an 18% decrease in coronary heart disease and 22% decrease in stroke would account for up to 230,900 fewer deaths per year in Chinese women > 50 years of age.\nThe log-linear association in our study has important implications for the relative benefits of PM exposure reductions at different points along the exposure–response curve ( Smith and Peel 2010 ), notably that the same absolute reduction at lower exposure levels may have greater population health benefit. For instance, based on our results, the cardiovascular benefit of transitioning from an improved biomass cookstove to liquefied petroleum gas may be greater than switching from an open fire to an improved biomass cookstove, even if the absolute emissions reduction in these two intervention scenarios is identical. Obviously, there are also considerable differences in cost and feasibility in these two scenarios that require consideration. Intervention options would benefit from cost–benefit analyses of different improved stove and fuel scenarios that incorporate these factors.\nWe cannot determine the duration of PM effects on BP or whether reductions in PM lead to decreases in BP, as has been shown for salt in randomized trials ( He and MacGregor 2002 ). Previous studies have shown that PM-triggered elevations in BP may occur acutely (2 hr) ( Urch et al. 2005 ) in a more delayed fashion (1–5 days) ( Zanobetti et al. 2004 ) and in the long term ( McCracken et al. 2007 ). A change in autonomic tone is the most likely mechanism for short-term increases in BP minutes after PM inhalation ( Brook et al. 2009 ). PM inhalation favors withdrawal of vagal activity and stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system ( Narkiewicz et al. 1998 ), resulting in systemic vasoconstriction, increased cardiac output, and acute change in BP ( Brook 2005 ).\nThe stronger estimated effect among older women in our study may be attributable to long-term oxidative stress and systemic inflammation due to lifetime PM exposure. PM inhalation has been shown to cause oxidative stress ( Barregard et al. 2006 ) as well as systemic inflammation ( Pope and Dockery 2006 ), which is associated with the development of hypertension ( Bautista et al. 2005 ). Long-term BP effects of PM exposure could also be the result of a resetting of BP-regulating mechanisms to higher levels as a consequence of repeated acute increases in BP after PM inhalation. Although underlying cardiovascular disease has been proposed as a potential driver of an age-by-exposure interaction ( Brook et al. 2010 ), it does not likely explain our results given the low cardiovascular disease prevalence in our study population. A recent study found the opposite, with stronger estimated effects of PM on BP in women < 50 years of age ( Dvonch et al. 2009 ), but this may be attributable to use of BP medication in older women, resulting in a dampening of the effect of PM on BP in this age group.\nConclusion\nOur study shows that personal PM2.5 exposure is positively associated with both SBP and DBP among adult women, particularly in those > 50 years of age. Although our findings should be confirmed in prospective cohort studies, they suggest that cardiovascular diseases may be an important component of the public health burden of indoor cooking and heating with biomass fuels. Issues of energy and indoor air pollution should therefore be considered in the formulation of policies and interventions aimed at reducing the cardiovascular disease burden in China and other countries where domestic use of biomass fuels is common.\nAttached Files\nPDF Version\nReferences\nAlbalak R, Bruce N, McCracken JP, Smith KR, de Gallardo T. 2001.

In an experimental study, we assessed multiple dimensions of vulnerability to driver stress by a questionnaire that was validated in previous field studies and related those dimensions to performance on a driving simulator. Results were broadly consistent with prediction. A dimension of habitual dislike of driving was associated with reduced control skills, greater caution, and disturbance of moods. A measure of aggressive driving predicted more frequent and more error-prone overtaking, which are effects attributed to the use of confrontive coping strategies in interaction with other vehicles. An alertness measure predicted speed of reaction to pedestrian hazards. This research has practical applications for system design, automated monitoring of driver performance, selection and assessment of drivers, and training.\nAnderson, J. R. (1982).

During regenerative decelerations, the nonlinear powertrain backlash would excite driveline oscillations, deteriorating vehicle drivability and blended brake performance. Therefore, backlash compensation is worthwhile researching for an advanced powertrain control of electrified vehicles during regenerative deceleration.In this study, a nonlinear powertrain of an electric passenger car equipped with a central motor is modeled using hybrid system approach. The effect of powertrain backlash gap on vehicle drivability during regenerative deceleration is analyzed. To further improve an electric vehicle's drivability and blended braking performance, an active control algorithm with a hierarchical architecture is studied for powertrain backlash compensation. Since the backlash in driveline is unable to be measured by a sensor, a high-level hybrid observer for backlash identification is designed at first. Then, based on the observation of the backlash traverse, a low-level switching-based active controller for powertrain backlash compensation is synthesized.The proposed control algorithm is simulated and compared with a non-active baseline strategy under regeneration deceleration. The simulation results show that the nonlinear powertrain backlash is well compensated by the developed active control algorithm, and the vehicle drivability and blended braking performance are also significantly enhanced.\nAlso in:\n""","1.0","""http://papers.sae.org/2015-01-1225/""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

Research from developed countries has consistently demonstrated associations between built environment features and physical activity levels of populations. The development of culturally sensitive and reliable measures of the built environment is a necessary first step for accurate analysis of environmental correlates of physical activity in LMICs. This study systematically adapted the Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale (NEWS) for India and evaluated aspects of test-retest reliability of the adapted version among Indian adults. Cultural adaptation of the NEWS was conducted by Indian and international experts. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with local residents and key informants in the city of Chennai, India. At baseline, participants (N = 370; female = 47.2%) from Chennai completed the adapted NEWS-India surveys on perceived residential density, land use mix-diversity, land use mix-access, street connectivity, infrastructure and safety for walking and cycling, aesthetics, traffic safety, and safety from crime. NEWS-India was administered for a second time to consenting participants (N = 62; female = 53.2%) with a gap of 2–3 weeks between successive administrations. Qualitative findings demonstrated that built environment barriers and constraints to active commuting and physical activity behaviors intersected with social ecological systems. The adapted NEWS subscales had moderate to high test-retest reliability (ICC range 0.48–0.99). The NEWS-India demonstrated acceptable measurement properties among Indian adults and may be a useful tool for evaluation of built environment attributes in India. Further adaptation and evaluation in rural and suburban settings in India is essential to create a version that could be used throughout India.\nDocuments\nAdaptation and Evaluation of the Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale in India (NEWS-India)\nRights statement: © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Within the automotive industry, these challenges mainly lie in reducing vehicle exhaust emissions and improving fuel and combustion efficiency. In this chapter, problems concerning exhaust emissions of soot, NOx, CO2, and unburned hydrocarbons from an internal combustion engine (ICE) are discussed first, including laws and regulations governing emission levels in various countries. Further, analysis is made on the recent shift from increasing mechanical power while maintaining fuel consumption to significantly reducing fuel consumption and emissions while maintaining power. Methods to reduce emissions and to improve performance in conventional engines are also discussed. The chapter then focuses on the latest development in ignition and combustion technology for new engine types. Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) which combines the concepts and advantages of petrol and diesel engines is discussed in detail. The combustion temperature of HCCI is about 500K below conventional diesel and spark ignition engines. As a result, an HCCI engine emits near zero levels of soot or particulate matter and achieves about 90-98% reduction in NOx raw emissions.\nItem Type:\n""","0.92643017","""http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/90115/""","[-4.28836,55.871751]"

This paper presents the design and implementation of an agent-based simulation tool that can be used to analyse vehicle routing algorithms. We demonstrate how the tool can be used in practice by implementing two vehicle routing algorithms: shortest-path and LANTIME.

The loading matrix of the correlations between the informational cues and discriminant functions (see Table 3 ) shows that function 1 was differentiated by physical skills (r = .48), the number of driving instructor interventions (r = .44), cognitive and perceptual skills (r = .39), road law/craft skills (r = .39) and vehicle handling skills (r = .39).\nThe second function discriminated clients who were classified as ‘Not fit-to-drive – Rehabilitation to be completed’ (given a positive weighting) from the other driving recommendations which were negatively weighted (see Table 2 ). Function 2 was differentiated by medical prognosis (r = .48), physical skills (r = .43) and driving instructor interventions (r = –.38) (see Table 3 ).\nTable\nView larger version\nLastly, the third function discriminated clients who were clearly either ‘Fit-to-drive’ or ‘Not fit-to-drive’ (given positive weightings) from the middling recommendation options, where clients either require rehabilitation (‘Not fit-to-drive – rehabilitation to be completed’) or were classified as fit-to-drive, but with licence conditions; these recommendations were negatively weighted (see Table 2 ). Function 3 was differentiated by vehicle handling skills (r = .53) and driving instructor interventions (r = −.42) (see Table 3 ).\nFinally, agreement between the occupational therapy driver assessors’ recommendations for fitness-to-drive was calculated. Across the 45 participants, agreement was very high at ICC = .97 (95% CI .96–.98).\nDiscussion\nSection:\nFitness-to-drive recommendations made by occupational therapy driver assessors\nTo answer the first question, Table 2 was constructed to show the range of fitness-to-drive (fit, not fit) recommendations made by a sample of 45 experienced occupational therapy driver assessors for 64 written case scenarios. Overall, 27% of drivers were recommended as fit-to-drive. This is a similar proportion to the number proposed by the research team as being fit-to-drive either with or without conditions. The most popular recommendation made was ‘Not fit-to-drive – Driver rehabilitation recommended’ (53%). While the most common form of rehabilitation may be for an occupational therapy driver assessor to develop an on-road training programme with a driver instructor, a recent systematic review ( Unsworth and Baker, 2014 ) located very little evidence to support the effectiveness of driver rehabilitation activities such as off-road training or practice on a computer-based driving simulator. While anecdotal evidence suggests that remediation of many skills and behaviours may be possible through rehabilitation programmes, further research to demonstrate the efficacy of these types of interventions is urgently needed if these services are to be promulgated and funded.\nCues used by occupational therapy driver assessors to determine fitness-to-drive\nTo answer the second question, the DFA analysis enabled us to identify combinations of predictor cues for fitness-to-drive recommendations (the discriminant functions). We now know which cues can be used to separate clients who are not fit-to-drive from those who are fit-to-drive by understanding their capacities in relation to: physical skills, the number of driving instructor interventions, cognitive and perceptual skills, road law/road craft skills and vehicle handling skills. These cues were highlighted as influential in function 1, which accounts for most of the variance (87%), suggesting that most importance can be placed on these when modelling how recommendations are made. These five cues also match very closely to the top five cues that therapists believe to be most important when making fitness-to-drive decisions as identified in a previous study ( Unsworth, 2007 ), with the exception of the cue ‘driver behaviour’. While therapists believed ‘driver behaviour’ to be important, and ranked it second highest ( Unsworth, 2007 ), this was not borne out in the current study. This may be because driver behaviour is most likely to impact on fitness-to-drive only when it is an extreme problem (scored as level 1), and occupational therapy driver assessors may have considered this behaviour as something that was possible to change through rehabilitation. The fact that the cues used by occupational therapy driver assessors in this study matched so closely to those in Unsworth’s previous study (with a small portion of both samples believed to overlap) suggests that occupational therapy driver assessors are generally insightful about their use of information to formulate decisions. This is rather unusual as clinicians often lack this perception, as shown by Harries and Gilhooly (2003) who found clinician insight into their referral prioritisation for clients with mental health needs to be only moderate (around r = .6), and higher for cues that were most important and least important in formulating referrals.\nWhen determining which clients would benefit from rehabilitation, three cues were given most attention in our study. The client’s medical prognosis was the key factor; if a client had a stable medical condition they were more likely to be offered rehabilitation, as opposed to those with a deteriorating condition. However, while prognosis may be a key consideration in whether or not clients can take advantage of rehabilitation, it is often acknowledged that predicting outcome for clients does require experience and expertise ( O’Sullivan, 2014 ), so training novices to use this cue may present challenges for us in the future. Also considered to be important was the client’s physical capacity. Clients identified as having sufficient physical skills to support safe driving were more likely to be offered rehabilitation services than those who had limited skills, even when car adaptations and compensatory techniques had been trialled. The occupational therapy driver assessors were being asked to make a fitness-to-drive recommendation in cases where adaptations had not facilitated driving capacity, but it is acknowledged that, in practice, adaptations can be made to compensate for most physical disabilities ( Rica, 2012 ). The third case feature given attention was related to whether the instructor had to intervene during the on-road assessment. If the instructor had intervened, the client was more likely to be offered rehabilitation services. We do know that in many licensing jurisdictions, occupational therapy driver assessors are required to fail clients if a physical on-road intervention is required. For example, in Victoria, Australia, this occurrence should produce an automatic fail decision as documented in the Competency Standards (OT Australia–Victoria, 1998 ). However, it is also known that this ruling is not always applied. For example, Caust (2010) reported, that in 10% of cases where an instructor intervention was required, occupational therapy driver assessors were still passing clients.\nFinally, we can predict the driving outcomes for clients who were clearly either ‘Fit-to-drive’ or ‘Not fit-to-drive’ from the two middle recommendation options, where clients either require rehabilitation (‘Not fit-to-drive – Rehabilitation to be completed’) or who were classified as fit-to-drive, but with licence conditions, by knowing their level of vehicle handling skills and again, the presence of driving instructor interventions. It is interesting to consider the role of vehicle handling skills in the decision-making process. In this instance, where vehicle handling skills supported safe driving (for example, managing the steering ability, braking speed and car controls such as pedal use) occupational therapy driver assessors were more clearly able to determine whether licensing conditions or rehabilitation were appropriate. As vehicle handling skills affect driving capacity, it may be that performance can be improved by driving only in familiar areas, as well as driving during daylight hours and avoiding peak traffic. In Australasia, driving in specific times or locations can be recommended by occupational therapy driver assessors as a condition of the licence. These conditions have the benefit of allowing drivers to continue driving (thus maintaining their lifestyle), whereas in some countries, such as the UK, some of these conditions are not available. European law does allow these types of conditions to be used ( European Union, 2006 ), and although some European countries have adopted them, the UK has not chosen to adopt most of them ( CONSOL, 2013 ).\nThis means that some individuals would be allowed to drive with a conditional licence in areas of Europe, and yet would not be recommended as fit-to-drive in the UK, even though both are regulated by European law. This situation may limit an individual’s social inclusion and community mobility and perhaps needs revisiting in order to support optimal health and social outcomes for older drivers and those with disabilities. While the DFA reported in this research was conducted with the data set as a whole, future analyses will also be conducted to examine individual differences among occupational therapy driver assessors in the way they make recommendations and the consistency of these recommendations.\nAgreement between the fitness-to-drive recommendations made by occupational therapy driver assessors\nThe final question related to whether experienced occupational therapy driver assessors could agree on fitness-to-drive recommendations for clients. We found that the agreement between the occupational therapy driver assessors was very high. This may have been due to the substantial level of experience held by the participant group. This bodes well for determining a consensus view of how fitness-to-drive recommendation should be undertaken. One reason the agreement was high may relate to the fact that there were only four choices for the outcome, rather than a visual analogue scale or a higher number of outcome choices. As reported in the introduction, studies using these types of outcomes have reported much lower levels of agreement among judges ( Harries and Gilhooly, 2003 ; Unsworth et al., 1995 ). Further analysis of agreement between occupational therapy driver assessors’ recommendations for fitness-to-drive will need to be undertaken to determine whether there are any sub groups of occupational therapy driver assessors who used the cues in a similar way, but differently from others. Even if recommendations are well matched they may have arrived at their decisions using different cue sets. In addition the application of the judgment policy is susceptible to an individual’s cognitive control in terms of both linear and non-linear cue use ( Cooksey, 1996 ). As mentioned, these investigations are planned and will be reported in due course.\nCritical evaluation\nSeveral limitations have already been described. In addition, it is also acknowledged that the sample of 45 occupational therapy driver assessors is small and the sample size could be increased in future studies. Nonetheless, a statistically stable DFA model was produced, and the high level of agreement suggests that our sample appears to have robust expertise in this domain. In addition, it must be noted that a DFA demands that all observations be independent of each other. In this research, while each observation was independent of others made by the same therapist, the observations may be viewed as clustered for each therapist. Future analyses may be conducted to tease out this issue further, possibly using a multi-level approach. The cues and their levels, as used in this research, were based on previous research in the area ( Unsworth, 2007 ) and expert review by our project advisory panel. While this assures a high degree of validity, the reliability of the cue levels could be investigated in future research. Finally, further investigation into the effectiveness of driver rehabilitation programmes is urgently required. While driver rehabilitation continues to be a decision outcome for many clients, research is required to determine whether such programmes are sufficiently successful to warrant their use.\nImplications for practice\nNovice occupational therapy driver assessors will be able to incorporate the findings from this research in their daily practice. They can reflect on the most influential cues used by the experienced occupational therapy driver assessors when determining, in the first instance, whether a client is fit-to-drive or not, and then further consider the client’s medical prognosis when reflecting on whether driver rehabilitation might be beneficial to facilitate a return to driving. The research team will also debate the outcomes with the project advisory panel members to ensure that the consensus judgment policy follows broad practice guidelines, and then develop training materials for novice occupational therapists to provide clear guidance that can be used to train occupational therapy driver assessors how to differentiate and recommend that a client is or is not fit-to-drive. Our research team plans to test the effectiveness of these training materials in the future.\nConclusion\nSection:\nA total of 45 occupational therapy driver assessors, with an average of over 10 years’ experience in driver assessment, provided their fitness-to-drive recommendations for a large set of case scenario clients. Statistical modelling has shown that by attending to client performance in five key cues (physical skills, the number of driving instructor interventions, cognitive and perceptual skills, road law/craft skills and vehicle handling skills), distinctions between clients who are fit-to-drive and not fit-to-drive can potentially be determined. Rehabilitation is likely to be recommended if the client’s medical prognosis is relatively stable, there is minimal physical disability and the driving instructor intervened during testing. Recommendations around conditional licensing may also take account of any driving instructor interventions and the client’s vehicle handing skills. Recommendations made in this domain appear to demonstrate a strong consensus among occupational therapy driver assessors, which bodes well for providing a consensus judgment policy for use in training. Future research is planned to determine whether we can successfully educate novices to make fitness-to-drive recommendations in the same manner as experienced occupational therapy driver assessors, thus ensuring translation of this research into practice.\nKey findings\nSection:\nWe identified five key types of information that experienced occupational therapy driver assessors use when formulating fitness-to-drive recommendations.\nWhat the study has added\nSection:\nOccupational therapy driving assessors are increasingly being asked to provide fitness-to-drive recommendations for clients with disabilities.

Seligmann, 2017""","""Abstract\nSection:\nIt is a commonplace that the Royal Navy entered the Great War intending to strangle the German economy through a strategy of blockade. This was not so. Prior to 1912 blockade was mainly seen as a means of attaining operational intelligence; economic warfare was secondary. For legal reasons blockade had to be abandoned in 1912. Thereafter, only contraband control remained as a means of waging economic warfare, and this was seen purely as a way of luring the Germans to battle. In 1914 the Royal Navy had no grand strategy, a fact that explains its hesitant performance in the war.\nKeywords\nRoyal Navy , economic warfare , First World War , grand strategy\nIn August 1930 Sir Maurice Hankey, Cabinet secretary, clerk to the Privy Council, and secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence (CID), flatly turned down a request by his one-time mentor, Major General Sir George Aston, to endorse his new book about the First World War. The reason for this rebuff was a difference of opinion about the quality and extent of Britain’s preparations for great power conflict in the years before 1914. Aston’s account argued that the government had not made adequate provision for the threat of a major war and that, as a result, Britain had entered the Great War without a properly defined grand strategy. Given that Hankey had played a key role in coordinating British preparations for war before 1914, he predictably took umbrage at the implied criticism of his efforts and those of his colleagues. Hankey contended that Britain had given considerable thought to strategic issues before 1914 and that, as a result of these deliberations, had entered the war ready to enact any one of several strategies. Not the least of these was the economic blockade, a weapon which had slowly but surely eroded the sinews of Germany’s fighting power and brought victory to the Allies. This, Hankey assured the highly sceptical Aston, had always been the intention. 1\nHankey’s assertion that in 1914 Britain possessed a well-considered and properly developed grand plan has won more adherents among historians than Aston’s view that it was lacking such schemes. Two main schools of scholarly thought have emerged on this topic which, if not mutually exclusive, certainly privilege different conceptions of how Britain proposed to fight and win a future great power conflict. On the one hand there are those who argue for the so-called ‘continental commitment’, an interpretation that places its main emphasis on Britain’s use of military power on land. 2 Adherents to this analysis differ on numerous issues, but central to their argument is the contention that at some point prior to 1914 – suggestions include 1904, 1906, 1909, and 1911 – the new War Office General Staff advanced the view that, in the event of a Franco-German war in which Britain intervened, the dispatch of a British expeditionary force to fight alongside the French army would be a decisive intervention. If sent across the Channel immediately and in its entirety, it would arrive on the vital battlefield just in time to negate Germany’s numerical advantage and so stem the tide in France’s favour, thereby winning the war for the Allies. The General Staff’s analysis, it is said, proved persuasive. Talks were authorized with the French military command, plans for enacting this were put on paper, and coordinating bodies such as the CID provided their endorsement. Thereafter, Britain was committed to a continental military strategy in the event of war with Germany.\nBy contrast, a second school assumes that it was not the army but the navy that was the instrument of Britain’s grand strategy, and that it was not battles but economic warfare that was the intended method of applying it. Traditionally this has been understood to mean that in the event of hostilities the Royal Navy would be used to cut Germany off from global trade, a form of gradual ‘blockade’ that, as was suggested in Hankey’s letter to Aston, would slowly grind down the German economy, undermine the nation’s fighting power, and so produce a British victory. 3 Recently a new variation on this argument has been proposed, one which depicts economic warfare as a quick-acting route to a rapid British triumph. Under this formulation, Britain’s pre-1914 grand strategy was to use its pre-eminent position in global finance, banking, insurance, cable communications, and shipping to cause a meltdown in the global economy, a process that would promptly deprive Germany of the financial means to continue the war. 4 The disputed merits of this thesis notwithstanding, 5 it mirrors earlier accounts in emphasizing that Britain had a grand strategy that was centred on the use of naval power and aimed at providing victory through economic means.\nAs can be seen, in the current historiography, controversy exists not over whether there was a British grand strategy, but over what constituted Britain’s grand strategy. Admittedly, this debate has taken a decided direction in recent times as the argument stressing continentalism has taken something of a drubbing from several of today’s most prominent historians. 6 Many have pointed out that the army did not speak as one voice on this matter: Henry Wilson’s views were not necessarily the same as those of Sir John French, who favoured independent operations in Belgium, let alone those of Lord Kitchener, who saw merit in keeping much of the BEF at home. In addition, while the General Staff might well have wanted to dispatch the expeditionary force to the Continent to fight alongside the French, before August 1914 no such strategy was ever endorsed by the only body constitutionally able to authorize such a move, namely the Cabinet. Thus, while permission may well have been given to hold talks with the French General Staff about possible military coordination, and while certain army officers might also have been successful in explaining their wartime preferences to the CID, none of this implied acceptance of their strategy. Indeed, even after Sir Henry Wilson’s tour de force before the CID on 23 August 1911, a performance that persuaded many that the army leadership was more professionally organized than its naval equivalents, there was no change of policy. Even after British entry into the war on 4 August 1914, the Cabinet remained undecided about how many divisions, if any, would be sent across the Channel, proof positive that the existence of a ‘continental commitment’ was unknown and unrecognized by those in power. Not surprisingly, arguments such as these have tended to loosen the ‘khaki grip’ on interpretations of British policy before 1914, strengthening the suggestion that British grand strategy was primarily maritime. As Hew Strachan has argued, it was privately recognized, even by Henry Wilson, that at best the BEF would help stave off a French defeat, allowing the navy to employ economic warfare as the ‘long-term means to ultimate victory’. 7\nThis article takes a different view. While agreeing with the criticisms that have been levelled against the increasingly disputed ‘continental commitment’, it nevertheless argues that the downgrading of this interpretation does not automatically mean that the Royal Navy, with its proposals for economic warfare, was the instrument of British grand strategy. It suggests, much as Sir George Aston did in 1930, that Britain had no grand strategy in 1914. This is not to imply that the Royal Navy possessed no war plans prior to the outbreak of fighting, nor that those plans ignored the option of economic warfare. The Royal Navy had well-developed war plans in 1914 and economic warfare was a central component of them. However, having war plans and having a grand strategy are not the same thing. This article will contend that pre-war plans to wage economic warfare against Germany have been misconstrued as the central part of British strategy they went on to become after 1915. It will show that, so far as the Admiralty was concerned, before 1914 economic warfare had a far more limited objective: inducing the German fleet to put to sea and so to force a naval battle that might enable a more proactive (but ill-defined) use of British sea power to affect the war on land. Thus, although extremely important to the Admiralty’s conception of how a war against Germany would be managed, these plans were primarily operational in focus. The article will demonstrate that, while different opinions existed within the navy and while there was certainly some change over time, a broad consensus did exist. The prevailing view was that, given the constraints to its application deriving from the state of international law, the need to take into account other countries’ sensibilities, the problems of geography, and the challenges posed by new technology, economic warfare was a weapon with finite possibilities. It could be expected to influence an opponent’s behaviour, but could not be counted upon directly to bring about his defeat. Nevertheless, the former attribute, if exploited properly, could be used to advantage, and this was the intent.\nI\nSection:\nIn order to understand the Admiralty’s attitude to economic warfare before 1914, it is necessary to establish accurately the relationship between the navy’s pre-war military and economic strategies. That such a distinction existed may surprise those who accept the view that the navy entered the First World War prepared to mount a ‘distant blockade’. However, distinguishing between what were, in fact, two independent strands of Admiralty thought is vital to the accurate comprehension of the navy’s intentions as regards ‘economic warfare’ by 1914. 8 The logical starting point for any such consideration is to establish what, if anything, constrained the navy in its ability to disrupt seaborne commerce in the pre-war period. Arguably the most important factor in this regard was the opinion of other powers, manifested in the ambiguous and contested realm of international law.\nIn addition to permitting belligerents to strike at will at the shipping of their enemies, which in a conflict with Germany would mean the swift eradication of all German-flagged vessels, international law in 1914 recognized two additional ways in which warring states could apply economic pressure to their opponents, both of which principally affected neutral sources of overseas supply: one was blockade; the other was the seizure of contraband or, as it is now better known, contraband control.\nBlockade consisted of denying the right of all shipping, irrespective of nationality or cargo, the right of access to or egress from those harbours, ports, and river estuaries that were both held by the enemy and covered by a blockading force. Ships of any and every nation, including those of neutral non-belligerent states, that attempted to cross the blockade line or, in British law, even intended to cross the blockade line, were liable to seizure as blockade runners and could be taken and condemned as prizes. In theory, therefore, a blockade could be total, denying the entry of goods of any kind into the ports and harbours affected. However, international law – as expressed by the Declaration of Paris (1856) – made one stipulation: for a blockade to be legal it had to be ‘effective’. While the term ‘effective’ was not without ambiguity, it was generally understood to mean that a blockading force had to be sufficiently numerous, strong, and proximate to a stretch of coastline under blockade to be able, in nearly all cases, to physically block entry or exit from the ports and harbours in question. This understanding had various implications, the most important of which was that, in the legal sense, there was not and could not be such a thing as a ‘distant blockade’, as such a strategy would immediately fail to constitute an ‘effective’ blockade on the grounds of proximity.\nContraband control was a very different beast. It conferred upon the warring states the right to seize articles having ‘belligerent destination and purpose’, that is to say, war materials being transported to the enemy. So long as the commodities in question were military in nature and it could be proven that they were intended for the use of one’s opponent, they could be seized from ships of any nationality, including vessels under the registry of neutral states. Additionally, although nations differed on the extent of this right, Anglo-American practice was to allow such seizures anywhere on the high seas – the intent to deliver the goods rather than the act of doing so being the key consideration. Added to this, under the doctrine of ‘continuous voyage’, Britain and America also held that goods could be seized as contraband even if they were consigned to a neutral receiver or were being delivered to a neutral port. The only condition for such seizure was proof that the neutral consignee was an intermediary of a belligerent power, or that the neutral port was merely a place of trans-shipment, the ultimate destination being the enemy. Thus, while the range of goods that could be impounded under contraband control was more limited than under blockade, being restricted to so-called ‘warlike stores’, the ease and scope of operations were much greater, there being no obligation under British prize law to maintain a force in proximity to the enemy’s littoral in order to enforce this right.\nFor the vast majority of the pre-war decade, the British naval plan for a war against Germany was based upon the idea that the primary instrument of British action would be blockade rather than contraband control. It should be stressed, however, that the main and overriding reason for this was a military one at the operational level rather than an economic one at the strategic level.\nIn the era before aerial reconnaissance, radio direction finding, radar and satellite imaging, and other remote forms of operational intelligence gathering, the only means of knowing if an enemy navy was in harbour or at sea was to go and look. Thus, in the event of war, if the German fleet was to be brought to action rather than suddenly appearing unannounced off the British coast as part of a raiding party or, worse still, an invasion, then the Royal Navy had to keep the main German harbours and naval bases under regular observation. Only by such means could it be absolutely guaranteed that the British Isles were secure from a surprise German assault. 9 The need to keep Germany’s ports under continuous observation accordingly became a central feature of British planning. Articulated in the earliest official plans for war against Germany, produced in 1901, it remained prevalent thereafter. 10 The 1909 war plan, to take but one example, called for the deployment of rotating flotillas of the newest and best British destroyers directly off the German North Sea littoral. Backed at a distance by lines of light cruisers and armoured cruisers to ensure that they could not be driven away by German light forces, these destroyers were there to notify the British naval command of any attempt by the German fleet to sortie into the North Sea. Should such a move take place, there would be two British fleets, one based in Scotland and one based between the Channel and the Wash, ready to intercept the emerging German forces and give battle. 11\nYet, if British naval deployments were mainly designed with such operational considerations in mind, it was also clear that they could be equally applicable to the purpose of applying economic pressure. After all, an inshore destroyer flotilla tasked with watching the coast for signs of activity from German warships could simultaneously and just as easily mount an ‘effective’ blockade against civilian traffic in the legal sense of the term, even if it was expressly stated in the instructions to these vessels that this was only ‘one of the subsidiary objects of the force employed’. 12 The majority of naval planners operated with this realization in mind – orders issued to the fleet in 1911 noted: ‘There is very little doubt that the Military blockade will be also effective as a Commercial blockade.’ 13 This dual role was facilitated by the fact that, under British prize law, the inshore destroyer flotillas that established the blockade did not have to be the vessels that policed it. So long as a legal blockade was in existence – and the destroyers ensured this was the case – then other naval assets could be tasked with tracking down blockade runners and could do so anywhere ‘within the area of operations of the warships detailed to render the blockade effective’, thus ensuring that mounting an effective commercial blockade did not distract from the destroyers’ key function of maintaining a military blockade. Thus, with a strong naval force deployed off the German North Sea coastline and the entrances to the Baltic, the Royal Navy would be legally able to interdict merchant shipping headed for Germany in the Straits of Dover or the northern entrances to the North Sea. Captain George Hope of the Naval Mobilisation Department expressed it thus: ‘the blockading force is not limited to the t[orpedo] b[oat] d[estroyer]s and cruisers stationed in the Heligoland Bight, but consists of all the naval forces in the North Sea’. 14 Crucially, however, and contrary to one recent argument, none of this removed the legal requirement to mount an ‘effective’ blockade. 15 The area of operations might be ‘the whole of the North Sea’ and cruiser cordons might be strung from Scotland to Norway and across the Straits of Dover, but as Admiral Bethell explained, these were merely the ‘outer lines of the blockading force’; they did not render it ‘effective’. 16 That was down to the forces in the Bight, forces put there first and foremost with the object of ‘preventing raiding expeditions [and] the German fleet putting to sea without the British Commander-in-Chief knowing it’.\nIf blockade became the main means of applying economic pressure largely on account of its primary role in dispositions designed for gaining operational intelligence and forcing battle, the alternative means of applying economic pressure, contraband control, having no part to play in the Royal Navy’s operational thinking, inevitably took on a secondary role. Aside from its mismatch with existing military plans, there were various other reasons for not pressing this particular belligerent right too strongly. For one thing, all the historical precedents suggested that neutral states tended to object strongly to the interference with legitimate trade that its exercise normally occasioned. Many of the bitter diplomatic complications of the wars of the eighteenth century had arisen from British attempts to suppress the flow of contraband and it was not considered desirable to repeat this experience in any future war. As Reginald McKenna, the first lord of the Admiralty, fully recognized: ‘a powerful neutral would make its protests felt so forcibly that we should have … to relinquish our rights of seizing neutral vessels’. 17 In this context the United States, a nation that had traditionally vigorously defended neutral rights, naturally loomed large. Accordingly, pre-war orders to British warships regarding their treatment of neutral vessels repeatedly stressed that:\nthe temporary detention of neutral ships, even in circumstances of necessity, is likely to give rise to international complications and should therefore be restricted as much as possible. In the United Kingdom the right should not be exercised without the authority of the Admiralty. 18\nIn a clear demonstration of the continuity of Admiralty thinking, once the war came, these orders were quickly issued again in even more direct form. A mere two weeks into the conflict, Churchill ordered:\nGreat care is to be taken in the diversion of neutral ships with neutral cargo. It is of prime importance to keep the United States of America as a friendly neutral. Diversion of doubtful ships should be reported to Admiralty. 19\nThe point, first articulated in late 1911, was crystal clear.\nSecondly, contraband control was not regarded as an easy right to enforce. No merchant intent on transporting contraband goods to a belligerent would be so naive as to carry a bill of lading openly stating this. 20 The true destination would inevitably be well hidden, ensuring that providing convincing evidence of enemy destination before an independent judicial body such as a prize court would be anything but a simple task. 21 Charles Ottley, the director of naval intelligence (DNI), ruefully noted: ‘the onus of proof as to its ultimate destination would rest with us’. For this reason he believed that, in a war with Germany, not only could Britain ‘not hope to prevent that country from obtaining any contraband over her land frontiers’, but in addition it would be extremely difficult to prevent it reaching Germany by sea as it could be carried in neutral bottoms and unloaded in neutral harbours. Regrettably, he wrote, ‘Contraband for Germany … could always be landed in neutral European ports under the very guns of our cruisers.’ 22 Such difficulties were assumed to make contraband control a much weaker weapon than blockade, and for this reason it was generally viewed as a supplement to, rather than an essential component of, any putative economic warfare campaign against Germany. As the Admiralty Secretariat’s Naval Law Branch succinctly put it, the value of seizing contraband was that it would ‘increase the severity of a blockade’. 23\nFinally, contraband control was one of the few maritime belligerent rights that could be employed to damage Britain’s own interests. This was clearly true of a great power conflict in which Britain was neutral. In this eventuality, legal limits on the right of belligerents to interfere with British-flagged shipping would certainly be valuable, a fact that undoubtedly influenced the government to seek protections for legal British commerce. Importantly, however, it was also believed that this right would be detrimental to British interests in a war in which Britain was a combatant. 24 Nobody really conceived that another power could mount anything approaching an ‘effective’ blockade of the extensive coastline of the British Isles in the face of British naval power. However, the prospect that enemy commerce raiders might both sink British-flagged merchant ships, as they were naturally entitled to do, and also detain cargoes headed for Britain in neutral vessels was viewed with a good deal more concern. Indeed, the dangers of such a guerre de course had been appreciated in Britain since the 1880s. 25 Thus, it was in Britain’s interests to ensure that those goods which Britain imported and which were vital to the nation’s well-being were considered ineligible for inclusion on any nation’s contraband list. This meant arguing that definitions of contraband should be kept as narrow as possible. In the Admiralty’s view, the best solution was for absolute contraband to be limited to ‘munitions of war only’; for ‘the list of items never to be intercepted as contraband … [to] be as extensive as possible’; and for the category of goods that had both civilian and military application – and hence were free from seizure if intended for the general population, but could be condemned as ‘conditional contraband’ if destined for the armed forces – to be abolished altogether. 26\nThis British emphasis on extensively exploiting the right of blockade but taking a much more circumspect attitude over the question of contraband control was most strongly in evidence when it came to the British negotiating position at the two international conferences called at the end of the first decade of the twentieth century to codify the international laws of war at sea. At both the Second International Peace Conference at The Hague (1907–8) and the London Naval Conference (1908–9) the British delegates sought to make the very wide British interpretation of blockade the basis for a common code of law, while simultaneously arguing for the introduction of major restrictions when it came to the right to seize contraband. In doing so, they were acting in line with the Admiralty’s explicit recommendations. At the meetings of the interdepartmental committee held under the chairmanship of Attorney General John Walton to establish the British government’s position on the issues likely to arise at The Hague Conference, the Admiralty had strongly pushed for stringent limitations on the right to seize contraband at sea. However, none of this implied any weakening in the attitude to blockade. As the DNI argued:\nOf course, I would on no account touch the ‘Right of Blockade’, and by consequence would ruthlessly sink, capture or destroy every vessel, whatever her nationality, neutral or belligerent, which attempted to enter a blockaded port. 27\nIn line with this position, when the conference finally took place, the British delegation proposed the complete abolition of contraband and, when that was resoundingly rejected by the other powers, it argued, largely unsuccessfully, for a strict definition of all categories of contraband. In contrast, as regards blockade, the Admiralty repeatedly stressed that it attached ‘great importance to the maintenance of the British Law as to blockades’; 28 that it was strongly of the view that ‘the established law of British Prize Courts [on blockade] … should not be liable to indefinite and unlimited modification’; 29 and that it was, therefore, essential that the British delegates ‘obtain a settlement of the question of the law of blockade in a manner satisfactory to British policy’. Moreover, their lordships were quite prepared to see the conference fail if this could not be achieved. 30 It was an emphatic position and one from which the Admiralty would not budge, as was evidenced a year later at the London Naval Conference.\nAs had been the case in 1907, a pre-conference interdepartmental committee met to hammer out the British position – this time chaired by Lord Desart. Once more the British delegation arrived at the conference with instructions to ensure that as much as possible of British blockade law was incorporated into any common code, while at the same time working to place strict limits on the right to seize contraband by securing definite lists of those items that constituted absolute contraband, conditional contraband, and non-contraband goods. 31 Significantly, in a departure from the stance taken at the previous conference and one that clearly shows the importance the Admiralty attached to this issue, to attain these much-desired outcomes the British government was now willing to accept some curtailment of the doctrine of ‘continuous voyage’, a concession that gained some traction with several European powers. 32 Consequently, after much negotiation, the British programme was essentially achieved. Under the terms of the Declaration of London, strict limits were placed on contraband control, but wide powers were granted under the laws of blockade.\nGenerations of scholars have correctly identified that Britain did not impose an effective blockade on Germany during the First World War – the so-called ‘blockade’ being, in fact, a form of contraband control – and that, for this reason, the British government was to be heavily hamstrung in the early days of the conflict by the need to limit seizures of contraband to a very limited range of goods. 33 Thus, these writers have been universally astounded by the position that Britain adopted at the London Naval Conference, which seemed to defy all logic. Anthony Morris is far from atypical when he observes that ‘given the Admiralty’s attitude, it is difficult to understand why … its representatives … agreed to the Declaration which … disabled the navy’s most effective offensive weapon against Germany’. 34 On the basis of the apparent lack of logic in the Royal Navy’s stance and the seeming inconsistency between the service’s professed desires at these pre-war conferences and its actual behaviour in wartime, some authors have concluded that the only possible explanation is that the Admiralty never intended to adhere to international law. Instead it is assumed that, in the event of Britain being a belligerent, the Royal Navy planned to jettison those agreements that limited its freedom of action and act as it pleased. Several bellicose statements to this effect by McKenna and First Sea Lord Sir John Fisher have been advanced in support of this proposition. 35 Notwithstanding the robust comments from Britain’s then naval leaders, there are clear problems with this interpretation. For one thing, it assumes that the Admiralty had the determining voice in matters of high policy. It did not; responsibility in this area rested with the Cabinet as advised by numerous interested departments, of which the Admiralty was only one and not necessarily the most influential. 36 Perhaps more saliently, however, there is a more straightforward and less Machiavellian explanation for the Admiralty’s stance at The Hague and London conferences. When one considers that at the time of both of these gatherings Britain’s naval plans were firmly premised on the utilization of blockade, in the strict legal sense of the term, and had been for some considerable time, the position taken at the venues is anything but inexplicable. Starkly put, the Royal Navy sought to gain the maximum latitude for the instrument it actually intended to utilize, while curtailing as far as possible those belligerent rights that could be employed to harm British interests and which, in any case, they did not intend to use, or would use only sparingly.\nThe British government’s commitment to this position is further evident in the extensive parliamentary battle that was fought to secure legislative ratification of the Declaration of London. From the signing of the convention in 1909 through to its final rejection in the House of Lords in December 1911 and beyond, the Liberal government sought to enshrine the new code into British prize law. It was still planning on achieving this in July 1914. Ironically, that it failed turned out to be fortuitous.\nThe reason for this apparent paradox was that in May 1912, only a few months after the bill’s final rejection, British naval plans underwent a fundamental transformation. In many respects this is quite surprising. As we have seen, the existing idea of blockading the German coast had been central to them since at least 1904, if not before. Moreover, it had been tested and validated in a series of manoeuvres undertaken as recently as June 1911, which had shown that blockade was possible even against coasts defended by flotilla craft. 37 Furthermore, the concept had been presented to the CID on 23 August 1911 by First Sea Lord Sir Arthur Wilson, when, contrary to many accounts, it had not been rejected. 38 Indeed, only a week after the now notorious meeting when the plans were reconfirmed, the C.-in-C. Home Fleets declared:\nThe present War Plans provide for a blockade of the Heligoland Bight … with the principal object of … preventing the German Fleet putting to sea without the British Commander-in-Chief knowing it and, when it is known to be at sea, conveying to him such information as to its movements as will enable it to be brought to action by the British Main Fleet. 39\nHowever, the new naval leadership that was put in place after Sir Arthur Wilson’s enforced retirement in December 1911 decided to abandon it. The new Board of Admiralty was worried that the belated expansion of the German submarine service, combined with the enhanced potential of mine warfare and the upgrading of Germany’s fixed coastal defences, made the use of inshore destroyer flotillas extremely hazardous. Particularly significant in this calculation were the logistical difficulties of keeping sufficiently numerous and powerful watching forces on station. Given that crews required rest, ships needed to be refuelled, and time was needed to travel the not inconsiderable distance from British ports to the German Bight – for example, Cromarty to the mouth of the Ems was over 400 miles – no more than a third of the navy’s destroyers could be on station at any given time. The same logic applied to the cruisers that would have to provide the vital close support required to enable the British destroyers to maintain themselves on station. Thus, despite Britain’s numerical superiority over the German fleet, it was no longer sufficient for an observational blockade. Hence it was decided to pull the watching forces back into the mid North Sea region. This decision would produce enormous tactical difficulties for the Royal Navy. Summer manoeuvres undertaken in 1912 and in 1913 to evaluate the effectiveness of the new dispositions revealed what generally became known as ‘the North Sea Problem’, 40 namely that watching forces in the middle of the North Sea, unlike their inshore equivalents, frequently failed to observe let alone intercept enemy raiding and invasion forces, which in the various tests managed to reach British shores undetected and unscathed. As the citizens of Scarborough would later be able to confirm when the real war came and they were shelled by German raiders that appeared off the British coast without warning, these results were not an isolated aberration. Given this vulnerability, it was hardly surprising that in the last years of peace the Admiralty was desperately searching for some means of reintroducing a viable form of observational blockade to secure Britain from invasion or raid. Proposals included: ‘reviving the strategy of close blockade’ by using submarines to mount ‘a watch of the enemy’s harbours’; capturing a German North Sea island as a base for renewed operations off the German littoral; and major destroyer operations in the Heligoland Bight. 41 Unfortunately, none of these options had been perfected by the time the fighting started in August 1914.\nThe Admiralty’s decision to pull back the watching forces and the failure to find a method of replacing them was not just problematic in terms of the naval defence of the British Isles; it also had wider implications for the navy’s ability to apply pressure to the German economy. If the Admiralty had concluded in 1911 that ‘Military blockade will be also effective as a Commercial blockade’, the natural corollary of this was that the removal of a military blockade rendered the commercial blockade ineffective and, therefore, in the legal sense, void. Yet, in the absence of an ability to impose a commercial blockade, the only remaining means of applying economic pressure was to fall back upon seizing German-flagged vessels and contraband control, the latter being the very belligerent right on which the British government had previously sought to place significant limitations. That the Royal Navy would now be limited to these means was well understood in the Admiralty. Sir Henry Jackson, the chief of the War Staff, observed in October 1913 that British ‘war plans lay down definitely that one of our objects in war is to bring economic pressure on Germany by stopping her overseas trade’. The two available means of achieving this, he explained, were for Germany’s ‘mercantile marine to be destroyed’ and for ‘contraband to be seized’ from neutral vessels. 42 Blockade, as a legally defined belligerent right, was no longer on the agenda.\nConsequently, when war came, the Royal Navy was not in a position to declare a blockade of the German coasts and never did so. Instead, by Order in Council the British government promulgated a list of goods that it regarded as contraband by virtue of their military value. These were declared subject to seizure if they were consigned to the enemy or if it could be proven, irrespective of their stated destination, that they were ultimately intended for enemy use. In short, Britain instituted a form of contraband control. There was both an upside and a downside to this course of action.\nThe positive feature was that the basic mechanics of a system of contraband control were very easy to implement. As by British law ships could be inspected for contraband far from the enemy’s shores, cruiser cordons in the Channel and in the gap between Scotland and Norway were all that was needed to force neutral vessels to submit to the process of stop and search by British naval forces. Inspection, the very first step in the system, was thus legally and procedurally straightforward, albeit complex and time-consuming to implement in practice.\nHowever, inspecting for contraband was not the same as stopping contraband. This proved to be much more difficult, entailing just the kinds of disputes with neutrals that had been anticipated before 1914. Moreover, to be effective as a form of economic pressure, contraband control required that the list of prohibited articles be a long and comprehensive one. However, as recently as 1909, in conformity with the then prevailing strategic outlook, the British delegates at the London Naval Conference had vigorously argued for numerous commodities and raw materials to be placed on the so-called ‘free list’ of items that could never be classed as contraband. Having not rethought their position since, this was still the position of the British government in August 1914 when the first wartime Order in Council was issued. The list of contraband goods was, therefore, quite a narrow one. In 1911 the likely desirability of extending the list in wartime had been raised by the then assistant secretary to the CID, Maurice Hankey. His boss and former DNI, Sir Charles Ottley, had dismissed the idea as too ‘violent a volte-face’ in British policy to imagine, even assuming, as he did not, that such a ‘defiance of the whole neutral world’ was actually possible. 43 Events would prove that, although Ottley was not correct in his assessment of the impossibility of such a move, he was entirely right to anticipate difficulties. When, after the outbreak of war, it was desired that the contraband list be extended, many neutral states could not see why a position that was good enough in 1909 was no longer considered applicable, and took great exception to the process of augmenting the contraband list, the lawfulness of which they fiercely, if unsuccessfully, contested.\nIf the addition of multiple new items to the contraband list was of questionable legality, the measures adopted to tighten the contraband control system by restricting neutral trade, for example by rationing neutrals to pre-war levels of certain imported goods in order to ensure against their re-export to Germany, were in most cases blatant violations of existing legal principles and were undoubtedly unlawful. Yet, at the same time, they were absolutely necessary as far as Britain was concerned if goods vital to the German war effort were not simply to reach Germany via neutral harbours. Accordingly, if these measures were to be adopted, a suitable pretext needed to be found to circumvent the inconvenience of their patent illegality. The fig leaf resorted to in nearly all cases was the well-established juridical concept of reprisal. In public at least, British illegal acts were justified as a necessary if reluctant response to illegal German actions. Conveniently for the British government, German infringements of international norms were many and frequent. As a later British assessment of wartime policy conceded: ‘but for the illegal conduct of Germany, which enabled His Majesty’s Government to justify its actions as reprisals, … the Order in Council of the 11th March 1915 [would have been] difficult, and that of the 16th February 1917, impossible to justify’. 44\nNevertheless, even if of questionable legality, by such means the British were able progressively to sever German ties with international commerce. However, the effects of this approach were felt only gradually and there were many complications to slow the process down. By no means the least of these was the fact that stringent trading restrictions, while certainly capable of impacting adversely on Germany’s position, had the potential to damage the British economy as much as if not more than the German one. This would have come as no surprise to the British government, as it was a feature of applying economic pressure that had been identified in 1912 by a CID enquiry into trading with the enemy. The Treasury and Board of Trade representatives on that enquiry had been at pains to emphasize that as both a major entrepôt and as a prominent trading nation Britain would need to keep its commerce going if it were to meet the expense of a great power conflict. Accordingly, they had argued that severing all links with Germany, Britain’s best pre-war customer, was as likely to play havoc with Britain’s finances as it was to embarrass German industry. They had further pointed out that, in the Crimean War, trade with Russia had continued to Britain’s advantage. It was a precedent that they regarded as instructive. Was it not counterproductive, they argued, for Britain to cease trading with Germany, albeit indirectly, if by continuing such activity Britain’s war potential was actually enhanced? 45\nAnother consideration was the recognition that cutting off German access to overseas supplies was not always the best way to hinder the German war effort. Contrary to popular assumptions, it was argued that the maintenance of some forms of trade might actually be a very effective means of dissipating German financial strength. The most obvious means of achieving this was by encouraging the Germans to purchase British-sourced non-essential luxury items, such as coffee and cocoa. Making these commodities available for purchase by Germany would contribute little to the German war effort, but their acquisition would require the expenditure of scarce foreign-currency reserves, specie that would flow straight into British coffers. The money thus expended could not be used by the Germans for really valuable war supplies, but once in British hands could be used for exactly such purposes by the Allies. 46\nAll of these considerations meant that tightening the system of contraband control required time and effort, along with the reaching of definitive decisions on controversial questions that were the subject of considerable debate within government. It also required the creation of an extensive expert bureaucracy of a kind that simply did not exist in 1914. This administrative machinery had to be built up from scratch, with a variety of ad hoc bodies, such as the Foreign Office’s Contraband Department and the War Trade Advisory Committee, being progressively formed to undertake the necessary tasks. Only by 1916, with the subsuming of the various agencies into one overarching Ministry of Blockade, had the administrative aspects of this issue been resolved. Even then, the completion of the bureaucratic structure did not give the British government full latitude to do what it wished or even what it was now capable of doing. It was only with the entry into the war of the United States in 1917 that it was empowered with the freedom to act as it pleased without having to consider the negative ramifications on neutral opinion. Thus, it can be seen that a comprehensive system of economic pressure built upon contraband control took time to create and even longer to make fully effective.\nSuch were the consequences of going to war in August 1914 having assumed prior to May 1912 that blockade would be central to British naval operations, having written most war plans on the basis of that premise, and then at the very last minute having changed to an entirely different approach. The result of this sudden shift was that the bureaucratic machinery for implementing this strategy had to be built up from scratch.\nII\nSection:\nOf course, the question might be asked, given that blockade was abandoned in May 1912, why more was not done in the two years and three months between this decision and the outbreak of war to align British plans for applying economic pressure more closely to the new dispositions of the fleet in the North Sea. The answer relates to what economic pressure was expected to achieve. It is often assumed that the goal was to act as a war-winning means of forcing German submission through the dislocation of the German economy. In light of post-war revelations of the impact of the ‘hunger blockade’ on the German people, it was natural to think that British planners must have known of the weapon’s potential, and that it was only a lack of willpower and decisive (ruthless) leadership that prevented its benefits not being realized sooner. In short, the benefit of hindsight transformed economic warfare into a great missed opportunity. However, while the severe dislocation of the German economy may well have become the goal of Britain’s naval leaders once the war was under way and static trench warfare had set in, before August 1914 the evidence suggests that economic pressure was conceived by most naval decision-makers as having a much more limited and specific objective.\nWhile it is certainly possible to depict elements of the Admiralty as being wholehearted supporters of economic warfare as Britain’s primary strategy in the event of war with Germany, it is important to appreciate that this viewpoint did not represent anything like the consensus that has sometimes been implied. 47 This can be illustrated by contrasting the views of two of the most influential officers in shaping the navy’s strategic discourse before 1914: one-time DNI and subsequent secretary to the CID Charles Ottley and the former C.-in-C. Channel Fleet – later First Sea Lord – Sir Arthur Wilson. The former contended that blockade would be war-winning because it ‘would sever an artery, essential … to the financial existence of Germany’. 48 As he famously stated:\nthe mills of our sea-power (though they would grind the German industrial population slowly perhaps) would grind them ‘exceedingly small’ – grass would sooner or later grow in the streets of Hamburg and wide-spread dearth and ruin would be inflicted. 49\nSir Arthur Wilson fundamentally disagreed. While it was true that the British navy might by means of blockade bring about a ‘stoppage of direct over-sea trade from her own ports’, he had no confidence that this would prevent supplies from reaching Germany. As he elaborated, ‘as she would probably have free access to the sea through neutral ports this, although a temporary loss to her shipping interests, would not greatly affect her general trade’. Thus, ‘with Holland neutral’, Wilson believed that ‘a blockade of the German North Sea Ports would be almost useless’. 50 Effectively, he took a diametrically opposite position to Ottley.\nIf there was a sharp difference of opinion between the Naval Intelligence Department and the naval leadership afloat during Ottley’s tenure as DNI, this lessened significantly when Ottley relinquished his post. The reason for this was that Ottley’s successor, Captain Edmond Slade, while an expert on economic warfare and a firm advocate of its use, was more alive than his predecessor to its potential limitations. On the one hand, he clearly recognized that Germany was fast ‘becoming a vast industrial nation’ and that, as this entailed a need for ‘the raw material with which to keep her industries going’, Germany possessed a vulnerability that Britain could exploit. Yet, keen though he was to make use of this, he was not as sanguine as Ottley as to its likely effect. This was partly because he was operating in a different strategic environment. Whereas during Ottley’s tenure as DNI the sheer magnitude of Britain’s naval superiority over Germany meant that a blockade of the entire German coastline, encompassing both Germany’s North Sea and Baltic ports, was a viable enterprise and one that Ottley had no doubt would be instituted, by the time Slade took office the increase in Germany’s relative naval strength made the prospect of pushing British forces into the Baltic an increasingly hazardous one. In November 1907 Slade, now DNI, while accepting that in an Anglo-German war Britain ‘shall be obliged at some point to enter the Baltic’, no longer conceptualized this as an operation that would commence at the very outset of the conflict. Rather, it would be attempted only later when it became ‘necessary to bring further pressure to bear in order to bring the war to a termination’. 51 By 1909, as the Admiralty informed the CID, plans for even this operation had been put on hold. 52 Whether this was a temporary or a permanent change is open to debate, given that as first lord from 1911 Churchill sought to revive the focus on the Baltic and even made ‘ultimate action in the Baltic’ his major goal in August 1914. 53 Be that as it may, in the circumstances facing Slade from 1907 to 1909, the blockade of Germany could only be a partial one, restricted purely to the North Sea. Goods would, therefore, be able to reach Germany via the Baltic route. In addition, Slade held that it would be possible for Germany to circumvent aspects of the blockade in the North Sea and so mitigate its effects. Expensive though it might be to import goods through neutral ports, Germany would evade much of the pressure Britain could apply by such means. ‘The Dutch and Belgian ports’, he wrote:\nare the feeders of such a vast region, a great deal of which would be neutral, that it would be practically impossible to prove anything against a vessel. Suspicion and presumption are not sufficient grounds to go on when dealing with a Court of Law, and it would be obviously impossible to check half the trade of Northern Europe because we considered that a small portion of it might be going to our enemy. 54\nIt might be noted that Slade was not alone in worrying about this. As late as December 1912 the CID was considering the problem that Belgium and the Netherlands posed to the British blockade. 55\nYet, more significant than such difficulties, for Slade coercion by economic means was simply not the pre-eminent instrument of war that it was for Ottley. ‘In order to increase the pressure on the enemy,’ Slade remarked, ‘and to strike at him financially, it is necessary to undertake secondary operations against his trade.’ However, as he went on to warn, ‘we must be careful to keep this in its proper place, and to remember that it is not the primary object of war’. This relegation of economic pressure from the top spot that it had held for Ottley, if not all of his contemporaries, to the status of ‘secondary operation’ naturally begs the question what the main objective now was. Slade made this clear with the further observation that ‘no consideration of attacking trade should be allowed to interfere with the operations against the main fighting force’. 56 That, of course, was the German fleet. The issue to which Slade then turned was would the German fleet come out to fight, and if, as seemed likely, it would not, could such secondary operations as economic pressure help to achieve this. If Slade had a comprehensive answer, it does not appear to have survived. However, it would be a matter that would continue to exercise both him and his successors.\nBefore August 1914 one of the principal problems facing the British naval leadership was the German battle fleet, a force whose mere existence constrained British freedom of action in the maritime sphere. At one level, this was a problem easily addressed. Few in Britain doubted that the German navy, which was both smaller in size than its British counterpart and without a proud history to inspire and encourage it, would be defeated in combat should an engagement with the Royal Navy take place. However, given that violent self-destruction at the hands of their enemies might not appeal to the German naval command, it was considered that engineering such a climactic battle might prove difficult. Some form of inducement was clearly necessary if the Germans were to be persuaded to come out of harbour and play the part that the British wanted them to play of committing suicide before a superior force. The incentive the Royal Navy came up with was to attack German trade. The 1908 war plans make particularly instructive reading on this point. As one section outlined:\nMinor operations of an offensive character will be necessary for the purpose of … inflaming public opinion in Germany and inducing the nation to force their navy to reply to them. … The first and most obvious way of damaging Germany is the immediate stoppage of … her maritime trade.\nJust in case this connection was not clear enough, a marginal comment on the first draft noted that the policy amounted to ‘forcing [the] German Fleet to expose itself to [our] offensive blow’. 57\nThe basis strategic assumptions contained within the 1908 war plans were carried forward in the years thereafter, including in the period when the very idea of mounting an observational blockade of the German coast began to come under review. In late 1911 the prime minister set up a subcommittee of the CID to enquire into the question of trading with the enemy. On several occasions the main naval member of the enquiry, Rear Admiral Ernest Troubridge, the chief of the War Staff and the officer directly responsible for overseeing war planning, explained that economic pressure was intended to provoke a fleet action. Thus, as he outlined at the fourth meeting:\nThe more effectually we were able to stifle German trade … the greater would be the risks which Germany would be willing to run with her naval and military forces to secure the continuance of some trade, and running these risks might provide us with favourable means for defeating her forces. 58\nSimilarly, at the fifth meeting, he noted:\nAny increase in the suffering inflicted by naval means would produce a moral effect, and tend to excite public opinion in Germany to insist on the fleet coming out to meet ours, which was what we desired. 59\nTroubridge’s position and the strategic assumptions it embodied were widely shared within the service. Sir William May, the former commander-in-chief of the Home Fleets and the chief umpire at both the 1912 and 1913 manoeuvres, noted in December 1912 that the capture of Germany’s overseas trade:\nif done methodically, will cause Germany a vast amount of inconvenience. … In all probability, the capture of German merchant ships will exasperate the nation, and the public feeling will be so strong that the German war fleet will be forced to come out and give battle to the British fleet. 60\nGiven this widespread belief, it was not surprising that it formed the basis of Admiralty strategy. Nowhere is this clearer than in the December 1912 version of the naval war plan, which states:\nThe general idea is to use our geographical advantage of position to cut off all German shipping from oceanic trade … To relieve such a situation, Germany would be tempted to send to the North Sea a force sufficient not only to break up the lines of lighter vessels actually employed upon the blockade but to offer a general action. 61\nThis point was reiterated by Troubridge’s successor as chief of staff, Sir Henry Jackson, when outlining the Admiralty’s war strategy to Winston Churchill in March 1913:\nThe War Plans are directed against Germany’s mercantile marine, with the hopes that sufficient pressure can be brought, through dislocating her trade, for the German Fleet to seek action with ours, and so end the struggle. 62\nIt was then further reiterated in October 1913, when a new set of war orders was produced for distribution to the admirals commanding the various home squadrons. These declared that the idea underlying British war plans was ‘to exercise economic pressure upon Germany by cutting off German shipping’, an action, it was hoped, that would put the British battle fleet ‘in a position to bring the enemy’s fleet to action should it proceed to sea with the object of driving the cruiser’s off [that were interfering with German shipping]’. 63\nIn short, between 1908 and 1913, the planning officers at the Admiralty consistently stressed that the logic of applying economic pressure to Germany was an operational one: forcing the German fleet to leave the safety of its harbours and give battle. This was not, as some have suggested, a blind quest for a second Trafalgar, but a rational desire to regain liberty of action. Only by defeating the German battle fleet – the instrument that kept the majority of the Royal Navy’s assets tied to the fringes of the North Sea – could the British fleet regain its ability to deploy in full force where it liked and undertake all and any operations of its choosing. How the Admiralty would have used this freedom of action is never properly spelt out. However, there were many options. Deprived of the need to mask this German force, the Admiralty might have sought to establish a genuine blockade of Germany, conduct large-scale amphibious assaults, or, most probably of all, undertake major operations in the Baltic. 64 However, first the German fleet had to be brought to action. While commercial blockade, as the stronger form of economic pressure, had long been the preferred instrument for achieving this, this did not mean that contraband control, the weaker form, was necessarily deemed insufficient for this purpose, and consideration had been given in the past to using it instead. Evidence of this comes from the 1907 war plans. These had considered a variety of different circumstances leading to war and had offered four different means of responding. Although three of the four contingencies (plans B to D) had conformed to type by imposing a rigorous observational (and hence commercial) blockade, the first of them, Plan A, had envisaged acting without this mechanism, making do instead simply with the enforced idleness of German shipping supplemented by contraband control. In justifying this alternative, the author of the plan, Captain George Alexander Ballard, a long-time stalwart of the Naval Intelligence Department and arguably the Royal Navy’s most experienced war planner, had fallen back on historical precedent. As he later explained, variant A of the plans:\nfollowed in its general outline the idea which underlay our operations in certain of the Dutch wars [of the seventeenth century] … By intercepting the Dutch trade … we forced the Dutch fleets to come out and defend it, and so brought on fleet actions near our own coast.\nHis hope in 1907 was that similar means applied in modern times could achieve the same result against Germany. As Ballard summarized it, the role of economic pressure in this scheme, even if only in the form of contraband control, was ‘tempting the enemy to come out and then catch[ing] him’. 65\nPlan A had not been adopted in 1907 because Ottley, then DNI, regarded blockade as a greatly superior instrument of economic pressure and saw no reason not to apply it. 66 Nevertheless, the precedent is significant, because in early 1912, at the very moment when a new naval leadership decided that blockade was no longer tenable and an alternative was needed, the officer appointed to head the Operations Division of the new Admiralty War Staff and thus to take charge of British naval war planning was none other than Captain Ballard. Not surprisingly, his solution to the planning gap created by the abandonment of blockade was to fall back upon the concept he had articulated five years previously and to seek to meet the Admiralty’s goal of enticing the German fleet to sea through the effects of contraband control.\nThus, the abandonment of observational blockade certainly created a major dilemma, but it was in the operational sphere – how to detect the egress from port of German naval forces in an era before effective over-the-horizon scanning. However, the fact that an alternative form of economic pressure already existed in the form of contraband control meant that there was no comparable urgency, as a result of the jettisoning of commercial blockade, to undertake a major reconsideration of Admiralty policy in the economic sphere. This is in itself revealing. Had the goal at this point been to bring about victory solely or even largely through economic dislocation, then the enforced abandonment of the only means widely accepted as being able to achieve this, and the substitution in its place of a method that was widely acknowledged to be much weaker and quite incapable of producing victory in its own right, would certainly have caused consternation in the Admiralty. However, for much more limited purposes, such as luring the German fleet to sea, contraband control was seen by many as adequate. Consequently, there would be an imperative to recast the policy only if the goal ever changed to the much more ambitious one of cutting Germany off entirely from global commerce and bringing victory through economic dislocation. Yet, such an ambitious goal was not articulated until the so-called ‘Reprisals Order’ of 11 March 1915, which sought for the first time to prevent the transit of all goods of enemy destination, origin, or ownership.\nIII\nSection:\nAs we have seen, for the Royal Navy in 1914 economic warfare was not an overarching grand strategy, but merely a means to an operational end. This subordination reflected a keen awareness of the legal restrictions surrounding the use of economic warfare and a belief that victory over the German fleet would be required in order to make full use of the navy’s power, be it to undertake amphibious landings, threaten the Baltic, or disrupt the German economy. In conceptualizing economic warfare as a means of forcing the Germans to battle, the Admiralty was adopting a line of thinking very much in accord with the prevailing orthodoxy of the day. As Sir Julian Corbett, the foremost exponent of British naval doctrine, explained in his classic Some Principles of Maritime Strategy (1911), the two means of securing command of the sea were decision by battle and blockade. 67 The former was naturally preferred, but when it could not be attained because the enemy would not oblige, the latter was an effective means of forcing him out, as history showed. Thus, just as Ballard had argued in 1909 when justifying his use of economic warfare as a lure in his war plan of two years earlier, so Corbett maintained that the Dutch Wars of the seventeenth century provided the classic example of why one would embark upon such an operation and how it would work:\nThe attempt to seek the enemy with a view to a decisive action was again and again frustrated by his retiring to his own coasts, where either we could not reach him or his facilities for retreat made a decisive result impossible. … It was soon perceived that the only way of dealing with this attitude was to adopt some means of forcing the enemy to sea and compelling him to expose himself to the decision we sought. The most cogent means at hand was to threaten his commerce. Instead, therefore, of attempting to seek out his fleet directly, our own would sit upon the fairway of his homeward-bound trade, either on the Dogger Bank or elsewhere, thereby setting up a situation which it was hoped would cost him either his trade or his battle-fleet, or possibly both. 68\nCorbett, of course, taught history and doctrine to naval officers and worked closely with the Naval Intelligence Department. 69 That his operational ideas matched those in the navy’s war plan is, thus, hardly coincidental. Both, however, are clear on one point. Economic warfare was not a national strategy in the run-up to 1914, but an operational means to a battlefield end. The implications of this are significant. If neither the continental commitment nor economic warfare represented a grand plan for victory, then Aston rather than Hankey was right. Britain might have had multiple plans in 1914, but it did not possess multiple strategies.\nThe consequences of this quickly became evident when the war began. The army leadership, having nothing other than a scheme for landing the Expeditionary Force in France, soon found that it was faced with the problem of learning how to beat the Germans on the battlefield. Ultimately Britain’s generals were successful, as the string of victories in the final hundred days of the conflict makes clear, but it was a laborious and time-consuming process and one that incurred enormous costs, both human and material. The situation for the Royal Navy was little different. Entering the fray with no clear means of keeping track of the enemy’s location and with a plan to induce battle as a result of contraband control, long recognized as the weakest form of economic pressure, Britain’s admirals had little choice but to improvise when the German fleet steadfastly refused to be drawn out. In this circumstance, making economic warfare work, despite the impossibility of declaring a legal blockade, was the sole remaining option. Unfortunately, few of the navy’s pre-war preparations, which had initially stressed military blockade over economic blockade and then highlighted contraband control over all other forms of economic warfare, were of much value in embarking upon a decisive assault upon the financial sinews of the German state. As a result, the means of waging such a war had to be learnt the hard way and the structures of implementation built from scratch. It was inevitably a slow and difficult process, made harder by Britain’s need to subvert long-accepted legal norms under the eyes of watchful neutral states. That it took several years to have any effect was the natural consequence of the failure to develop a grand strategy before 1914.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nNotes\n1\nHankey to Aston, 19 August 1930, with undated marginalia by Aston, Southsea, Royal Marines Museum, Aston papers, AST 6/8/5.\n2\nKey texts include: J.

Which cause categories dominate in particular places and which age-sex groups are most affected in particular populations vary widely. Fatalities due to external causes also present a non-trivial measurement issue, since instantaneous deaths in many settings are dealt with differently (e.g. by police and other authorities) as compared to deaths during or following medical treatment for injuries (typically in hospitals).\nThe Global Status Report on Road Safety 2013 ( 1 World Health Organization. Global status report on road safety 2013. 2013; Geneva: WHO.  [Google Scholar] ) reports over 1 million people killed on the world's roads annually, with numbers rising in some countries. Despite technological improvements in vehicles and roads, increasing traffic density can bring increased risks, particularly to pedestrians. The World Health Organization (WHO) African Region is estimated to have the highest rate of road traffic deaths, at 0.24 per 1,000 population, with the South-East Asia Region at 0.18 per 1,000 population.\nChild injuries have also been documented globally in the World Report on Child Injury Prevention ( 2 World Health Organization, UNICEF. World report on child injury prevention. 2008; Geneva: WHO.  [Google Scholar] ). Globally, child injury deaths number close to one million per year, with the majority occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Leading cause categories are road traffic and drowning.\nA review of data on suicide in Africa showed major gaps, making estimates of overall patterns uncertain ( 3 Mars B, Burrows S, Hjelmeland H, Gunnell D. Suicidal behaviour across the African continent: a review of the literature. BMC Public Health. 2014; 14: 606. [ PubMed Abstract ] [ PubMed CentralFull Text ].  [Google Scholar] ). Published rates from various African countries ranged from 0.004 to 0.17 per 1,000 population. A global analysis of suicide estimated a rate of 0.06 per 1,000 in the WHO African Region and 0.16 in the WHO South-East Asia Region ( 4 Värnik P. Suicide in the World. Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2012; 9: 760–71.  [Google Scholar] ). The same source estimated rates for violence and war at 0.23 per 1,000 population in Africa and 0.08 per 1,000 in South-East Asia.\nThe INDEPTH Network works with Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites (HDSS) across Africa and Asia, which each follow circumscribed populations on a longitudinal basis. Core data collected include person-time at risk, together with deaths and, by means of verbal autopsy (VA), assessment of cause of death ( 5 Sankoh O, Byass P. The INDEPTH Network: filling vital gaps in global epidemiology. Int J Epidemiol. 2012; 41: 579–88. [ PubMed Abstract ] [ PubMed CentralFull Text ].  [Google Scholar] ). This allows reporting of external cause mortality on the basis of individually documented deaths within defined populations, adding considerably to existing overall estimates, which are often based on health facility data.\nOur aim in this article is to document deaths among entire populations in a dataset from 22 INDEPTH HDSSs covering Africa and Asia, looking particularly at those deaths attributable to external causes. We define external causes here to include all of the WHO 2012 VA standard chapter 12 causes, corresponding to ICD-10 codes S00 to Y98 ( 6 Leitao J, Chandramohan D, Byass P, Jakob L, Bundhamcharoen K, Choprapawon C. Revising the WHO verbal autopsy instrument to facilitate routine cause-of-death monitoring. Glob Health Action. 2013; 6 21518, http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/gha.v6i0.21518 .  [Google Scholar] ). Although these 22 sites are not designed to be a representative sample, they enable comparisons to be made over widely differing situations, using standardised methods.\nMethods\nThe overall INDEPTH data set from which these analyses of external cause mortality are drawn is described in detail elsewhere ( 7 Streatfield PK, Khan WA, Bhuiya A, Alam N, Sie A, Soura AB, et al. Cause-specific mortality in Africa and Asia: evidence from INDEPTH Health and Demographic Surveillance System sites. Glob Health Action. 2014; 7 25362, http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/gha.v7.25362 [ PubMed CentralFull Text ].  [Google Scholar] ). Across the 22 participating sites 8 Razzaque A, Nahar A, Akter Khanam M, Streatfield PK.

Burden of premature mortality in rural Vietnam from 1999–2003: analyses from a Demographic Surveillance Site. Popul Health Metr. 2006; 4: 9. [ PubMed Abstract ] [ PubMed CentralFull Text ].  [Google Scholar] ) , there is documentation on 111,910 deaths in 12,204,043 person-years of observation. These data are available in a public-domain data set ( 30 INDEPTH Network. INDEPTH Network Cause-Specific Mortality – Release 2014. Oct 2014. Provided by the INDEPTH Network Data Repository. www.indepth-network.org . doi: 10.7796/INDEPTH.GH003.COD2014.v1..  [Google Scholar] ), and the methods used to compile that data set are summarised in Box 1.\nBox 1. Summary of methodology based on the detailed description in the introductory paper ( 7 Streatfield PK, Khan WA, Bhuiya A, Alam N, Sie A, Soura AB, et al. Cause-specific mortality in Africa and Asia: evidence from INDEPTH Health and Demographic Surveillance System sites. Glob Health Action. 2014; 7 25362, http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/gha.v7.25362 [ PubMed CentralFull Text ].  [Google Scholar] )\nAge–sex–time standardisation\nTo avoid effects of differences and changes in age-sex structures of populations, mortality fractions and rates have been adjusted using the INDEPTH 2013 population standard ( 31 Sankoh O, Sharrow D, Herbst K, Whiteson Kabudula C, Alam N, Kant S. The INDEPTH standard population for low- and middle-income countries, 2013. Glob Health Action. 2014; 7 23286, http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/gha.v7.23286 .  [Google Scholar] ). A weighting factor was calculated for each site, age group, sex, and year category in relation to the standard for the corresponding age group and sex, and incorporated into the overall data set. This is referred to in this article as age-sex-time standardisation in the contexts where it is used.\nCause of death assignment\nThe InterVA-4 (version 4.02) probabilistic model was used for all of the cause-of-death assignments in the overall data set ( 32 Byass P, Chandramohan D, Clark SJ, D'Ambruoso L, Fottrell E, Graham WJ. Strengthening standardised interpretation of verbal autopsy data: the new InterVA-4 tool. Glob Health Action. 2012; 5 19281, http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/gha.v5i0.19281 .  [Google Scholar] ). InterVA-4 is fully compliant with the WHO 2012 Verbal Autopsy (VA) standard and generates causes of death categorised by ICD-10 groups ( 33 World Health Organization. Verbal autopsy standards: the 2012 WHO Verbal Autopsy Instrument. 2012; Geneva: WHO.  [Google Scholar] ). The data reported here were collected before the WHO 2012 VA standard was available, but were transformed into the WHO2012 and InterVA-4 format to optimise cross-site standardisation in cause-of-death attribution. For a small proportion of deaths, VA interviews were not successfully completed; a few others contained inadequate information to arrive at a cause of death. InterVA-4 assigns causes of death (a maximum of three) with associated likelihoods; thus, cases for which likely causes did not total 100% were also assigned a residual indeterminate component. This served as a means of encapsulating uncertainty in cause of death at the individual level within the overall data set, as well as accounting for 100% of every death.\nOverall dataset\nThe overall public-domain data set ( 30 INDEPTH Network. INDEPTH Network Cause-Specific Mortality – Release 2014. Oct 2014. Provided by the INDEPTH Network Data Repository. www.indepth-network.org . doi: 10.7796/INDEPTH.GH003.COD2014.v1..  [Google Scholar] ) thus contains between one and four records for each death, with the sum of likelihoods for each individual being unity. Each record includes a specific cause of death, its likelihood, and its age-sex-time weighting.\nDeaths assigned to any of the WHO 2012 VA cause-of-death categories relating to external causes (VA12.01 to VA12.99) were extracted from the overall database, together with details of site, age group at death, and sex. Person-year denominators corresponding to the same categories were included from the corresponding surveillance data.\nOf the 22 sites reported in the data set, two (FilaBavi, Vietnam; Niakhar, Senegal) reported very few deaths due to external causes, accompanied by little specific information as to cause of death. These did not provide a credible picture of mortality from external causes, and consequently the following analyses are based on data from the remaining 20 sites, relating to 5,884 deaths over 11,828,253 person-years observed. The Karonga, Malawi, site did not contribute VAs for children. Sites reported for different time periods; overall, 5.0% of the person-time observed occurred before 2000, 28.2% from 2000 to 2005, and 66.7% from 2006 to 2012. As each HDSS covers a total population, rather than a sample, uncertainty intervals are not shown.\nIn this context, all of these data are secondary data sets derived from primary data collected separately by each participating site. In all cases, the primary data collection was covered by site-level ethical approvals relating to ongoing health and demographic surveillance in those specific locations. No individual identity or household location data were included in the secondary data, and no specific ethical approvals were required for these pooled analyses.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the overall numbers of deaths from external causes and the exposure time for each site, by age group. Figure 1 shows a map of the 20 sites, each one marked with its age-sex-time standardised overall mortality rate for deaths due to external causes, plus a note of the specific WHO 2012 VA external cause category and age group which accounted for the largest proportion of overall deaths from external causes. Approximately one-quarter of deaths due to external causes occurred in the under-15-year age group. External cause mortality at three of the Bangladeshi sites was dominated by drownings among small children, while elsewhere leading cause categories mainly comprised transport-related deaths, suicides, and assaults.\nMortality from external causes in Africa and Asia: evidence from INDEPTH Health and Demographic Surveillance System Sites\nAll authors\nAuthors listed alphabetically, within each site.\nReferences\nWorld Health Organization.

We have shown previously that one activity of the SPI-2 TTSS is the assembly of a coat of F-actin in the vicinity of bacterial microcolonies. To identify proteins involved in SPI-2 dependent actin polymerization, we tested strains carrying mutations in each of several genes whose products are proposed to be secreted through the SPI-2 TTSS, for their ability to assemble F-actin around intracellular bacteria. We found that strains carrying mutations in either sseB, sseC, sseD or spiC were deficient in actin assembly. The phenotypes of the sseB-, sseC- and sseD– mutants can be attributed to their requirement for translocation of SPI-2 effectors. SpiC was investigated further in view of its proposed role as an effector. Transient expression of a myc::SpiC fusion protein in Hela cells did not induce any significant alterations to the host cell cytoskeleton, and failed to restore actin polymerization around intracellular spiC– mutant bacteria. However, the same protein did complement the mutant phenotype when expressed from a plasmid within bacteria. Furthermore, spiC was found to be required for SPI-2 mediated secretion of SseB, SseC and SseD in vitro. An antibody against SpiC detected the protein on immunoblots from total cell lysates of S. typhimurium expressing SpiC from a plasmid, but it was not detected in secreted fractions after exposure of cells to conditions that result in secretion of other SPI-2 effector proteins. Investigation of the trafficking of SCVs containing a spiC– mutant in macrophages revealed only a low level of association with the lysosomal marker cathepsin D, similar to that of wild-type bacteria. Together, these results show that SpiC is involved in the process of SPI-2 secretion and indicate that phenotypes associated with a spiC- mutant are caused by the inability of this strain to translocate effector proteins, thus calling for further investigation into the function(s) of this protein.\nReceived 18 April, 2002; revised 30 May, 2002; accepted 31 May, 2002.\nRelated content\nArticles related to the one you are viewing\nCiting Literature\nNumber of times cited: 38\n1\nMiryoung Song, Ju-Sim Kim, Lin Liu, Maroof Husain, Andrés Vázquez-Torres, Antioxidant Defense by Thioredoxin Can Occur Independently of Canonical Thiol-Disulfide Oxidoreductase Enzymatic Activity, Cell Reports, 2016, 14, 12, 2901\nCrossRef\n2\nZhao Cheng, Junlei Yin, Xilong Kang, Shizhong Geng, Maozhi Hu, Zhiming Pan, Xinan Jiao, Safety and protective efficacy of a spiC and crp deletion mutant of Salmonella gallinarum as a live attenuated vaccine for fowl typhoid, Research in Veterinary Science, 2016, 107, 50\nCrossRef\n5\nVanessa M.

Current psychometry-based diagnostic methods are effective, but time-consuming and a universal ‘gold standard’ test has yet to be agreed upon. Critical Flicker Frequency (CFF) is a proposed language-independent diagnostic tool for MHE, but its accuracy has yet to be confirmed.\nAim\nTo assess the diagnostic accuracy of CFF for MHE by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies, which report on the diagnostic accuracy of this test.\nMethods\nA systematic literature search was performed to locate all publications reporting on the diagnostic accuracy of CFF for MHE. Data were extracted from 2 × 2 tables or calculated from reported accuracy data. Collated data were meta-analysed for sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and summary receiver operator curve (sROC) analysis. Prespecified subgroup analysis and meta-regression were also performed.\nResults\nNine studies with data for 622 patients were included. Summary sensitivity was 61% (95% CI: 55–67), specificity 79% (95% CI: 75–83) and DOR 10.9 (95% CI: 4.2–28.3). A symmetrical sROC gave an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.84 (SE = 0.06). The heterogeneity of the DOR was 74%.\nConclusions\nCritical Flicker Frequency has a high specificity and moderate sensitivity for diagnosing minimal hepatic encephalopathy. Given the advantages of language independence and being both simple to perform and interpret, we suggest the use of critical flicker frequency as an adjunct (but not replacement) to psychometric testing.\nUnited Kingdom National Institute for Health Research\nAlan Morement Memorial Fund\napt12199-sup-0002-FigS2.tif image/tif, 2464K\nFigure S2.

In particular, the unique subsurface drill will address some of these, such as the possible existence and stability of subsurface organics. PanCam will establish the surface geological and morphological context for the mission, working in collaboration with other context instruments. Here, we describe the PanCam scientific objectives in geology, atmospheric science, and 3-D vision. We discuss the design of PanCam, which includes a stereo pair of Wide Angle Cameras (WACs), each of which has an 11-position filter wheel and a High Resolution Camera (HRC) for high-resolution investigations of rock texture at a distance. The cameras and electronics are housed in an optical bench that provides the mechanical interface to the rover mast and a planetary protection barrier. The electronic interface is via the PanCam Interface Unit (PIU), and power conditioning is via a DC-DC converter. PanCam also includes a calibration target mounted on the rover deck for radiometric calibration, fiducial markers for geometric calibration, and a rover inspection mirror. Key Words: Mars—ExoMars—Instrumentation—Geology—Atmosphere—Exobiology—Context. Astrobiology 17, 511–541.\n1. Introduction\nPanCam is one of the context instruments on the ExoMars rover (Vago et al., 2017 , in this issue) and will provide images in the visible and near infrared (NIR), from which crucial observations of landscape morphology, geology, and atmospheric science may be derived. PanCam will be the prime tool to characterize the morphology and geology of rock outcrops on the martian surface and will be crucial during mission operations for geological target selection and characterization. PanCam data will support the overarching exobiological objective of ExoMars through the characterization of paleoenvironments that involved sustained liquid water at the ExoMars study site. The PanCam spectral range is extended by the Infrared Spectrometer for ExoMars (ISEM) instrument (Korablev et al., 2017 , in this issue), which will add to the mineralogical determination; as shown by Harris et al. ( 2015 ), definitive identification of unique minerals is rarely achievable with the PanCam wavelength range alone. In addition, the Close-UP Imager (CLUPI; Josset et al., 2017 , in this issue) will provide high-resolution images of potential drilling sites and other interesting samples. Subsurface context will be provided by a ground-penetrating radar (Water Ice and Subsurface Deposit Observation On Mars, WISDOM; Ciarletti et al., 2017 , in this issue) and a neutron detector (Autonomous Detector of Radiation Of Neutrons, ADRON; Mitrofanov et al. 2017 , in this issue), as well as a visible-IR spectrometer (Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsurface Studies, Ma_MISS; De Sanctis et al., 2017 , in this issue) in the drill tip to provide in situ mineralogy for the subsurface samples before they are brought to the surface. Sample analysis will be by the Analytical Laboratory Drawer (ALD) instruments, MicrOmega (Bibring et al., 2017 , in this issue), RLS (Raman spectrometer; Rull et al., 2017 , in this issue), and Mars Organic Molecule Analyser (MOMA; Goesmann et al., 2017 , in this issue).\nPanCam will be fundamental in the day-to-day scientific operations of the rover. The images and other data products will be available to the team soon after downlink to assist with scientific decisions on where to drive next, on what targets of interest geological observations should focus on, and where and which rock units ExoMars should drill. The team intends to make images available via ESA in near real time for outreach purposes as appropriate. The central role of PanCam in these activities has been shown to be vital in many field trials already (e.g., Schmitz et al., 2009 ; Steele et al., 2010 ; Gunes-Lasnet et al., 2014 ).\nIn this paper, after presenting the team organization, we discuss the PanCam scientific objectives and instrument design, and the measurement scenario, calibration, and 3-D vision aspects.\n1.1. Team organization\nThe PanCam team organization is illustrated in Fig. 1 . Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL) is the principal investigator (PI) institute with overall responsibility for the instrument, supported by co-PI involvements for major hardware contributions at DLR, Germany (supported by industry, OHB), and Space-X, Switzerland (supported by industry, RUAG). In addition, there are lead-co-I roles in Austria (Joanneum Research—3-D vision team lead) and Wales (Aberystwyth University—Small Items lead). The hardware team is led by a project manager. The international science team is co-chaired by the PI and co-PIs.\nIn addition to the science team, which has association with each of the key components, co-I “swaps” have been initiated with the ISEM, WISDOM, and CLUPI teams, emphasizing and enhancing the collaborative nature of the mission.\n2. Scientific Objectives\n2.1. Contribution to overall rover mission science\nThe overall goals of the ExoMars 2020 rover (Vago et al., 2017 , in this issue) are to search for signs of past and present life on Mars and to characterize the water/geochemical environment as a function of depth in the shallow subsurface. The key new aspect of the mission is the retrieval and analysis of subsurface samples from 0 to 2 m below the oxidized surface of Mars. Rover operations include an integrated set of measurements at multiple scales: beginning with panoramic imaging and analysis of the geological context, progressing to finer-scale investigations of surface rock outcrops, and culminating with the collection of well-selected subsurface (or surface) samples to be studied in the rover's analytical laboratory.\nThe main scientific objectives of PanCam may be summarized as follows:\n(1) Provide 2-D and 3-D geological and mineralogical context information through imaging, including construction of digital terrain models (DTMs) and their visualization;\n(2) Support the selection of rover science and drilling sites by providing geological and mineralogical characterization of target rock outcrops;\n(3) Geologically investigate and map the rover science traverse and drilling sites;\n(4) Locate the landing site, the science sites, and the rover position with respect to local and global references by comparison and data fusion with data from orbiters;\n(5) Support rover traverse planning with geological context of the environment;\n(6) Image and characterize the acquired drill samples;\n(7) Study the properties of the atmosphere and variable phenomena, including water and dust content of the atmosphere.\nPanCam will determine the geological and geomorphological context for the remainder of the rover payload. A pair of Wide Angle Cameras (WACs) and a close-up High Resolution Camera (HRC) located at the top of the mast of the rover, together with geological, atmospheric, and red/green/blue filters, constitute a powerful camera system for planetary science. The WACs and HRC enable complementary imaging at different scales to obtain both wide-angle multispectral stereoscopic panoramic images and high-resolution color images. PanCam can view the lander upper surface and verify mechanism deployments and potentially the interaction of the drill and the rover wheels with the regolith. PanCam is the main ExoMars rover instrument for the remote characterization of the landing site's geological context, to provide detailed 3-D DTMs through stereo imaging and measure the surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF).\nThe two WACs will each generate multispectral stereo images with 38.3° field of view (FOV) (horizontal/vertical), and the HRC will provide monoscopic “zoom” images with 4.88° FOV (horizontal/vertical; see Table 2 ); the combination provides morphological information on the rover surroundings. The WACs use multiple narrow-band filters to constrain the mineral composition of rocks and soils and the concentration of water vapor and the dust optical properties in the atmosphere.\nThe HRC can acquire high-resolution subset images of the wide-angle panoramas, as well as image mosaics, and furthermore enables high-resolution imaging of inaccessible locations, for example, on steep slopes such as crater or valley walls. It also allows observation of retrieved subsurface samples before ingestion into the Sample Preparation and Distribution System (SPDS) of the Pasteur payload. Combined with a Rover Inspection Mirror (RIM), placed at the front end of the rover body, engineering images of the underside of the rover chassis as well as views of the rover wheels for soil mechanics science and wheel wear can be acquired with the HRC. In addition, views of the underside of overhanging rock formations may also be acquired.\nThe wide-angle (WACs) and close-up (HRC) capability thus provides imaging at different scales, from submillimeter resolution (HRC) directly in front of the rover up to millimeter-to-meter resolution to effectively infinite distances. These properties allow the acquisition of information to support rover navigation. PanCam is the only scientific instrument on the rover that can generate detailed 3-D DTMs, slope maps, and similar products. This will be complemented by lower-resolution Navigation Camera (NavCam) data. It should be noted that NavCam has a 65° FOV with a 150 mm stereo baseline and is accommodated on the mast in front of PanCam tilted down by 18° (Silva et al., 2013 ). After a drill site has been selected, using PanCam and other context information, the instrument can also view the drill tailings and thus provide complete geological context for the subsurface samples.\n2.2. Specific scientific goals\nCamera experiments are an indispensable component of the scientific payload of any surface planetary mission, whether it is a stationary lander or a mobile rover (e.g., Bell et al., 2003; Edgett et al., 2012 ; Gunn and Cousins, 2016 ; Maki et al., 2012 ). PanCam will study the geological diversity of individual local areas along the rover traverse and will be a significant contributor to the scientific output of ExoMars, particularly to characterization of surface geology and geomorphology, atmospheric sciences, and cartography/geodesy. Importantly, analysis of PanCam imagery will guide the selection of areas and rock outcrops for more detailed analysis and provide stratigraphic context for these sites. The application of stereo imaging will significantly enhance the ability of the science team to investigate terrain and geology through 3-D vision. DTMs and the corresponding texture maps in a visualization environment will enhance the quantitative analysis of the geomorphology and geology of target areas. In the following sections, we describe in detail the scientific objectives that will be addressed by PanCam.\n2.2.1. Geology and geomorphology\nThe major objective of PanCam imaging with respect to geology and geomorphology is the identification and characterization of rock and unconsolidated surficial units on the basis of their morphology, geometry, distribution, and physical (e.g., cohesion) and spectral properties (the latter will be addressed in the next section on color investigations). Perhaps the single most important contribution of PanCam science to the mission will be to help reconstruct the geological and geomorphological history of the ExoMars study area and in particular to define the stratigraphic context. This is crucial to place sample analysis in a geological spatial and relative temporal framework. The search for biosignatures requires an understanding of the local and regional geological context (e.g., Westall et al., 2015 ), which will be interpreted mainly, but not exclusively, from imaging data. As geological context encompasses the multiscale character of natural systems, context information for planetary rover missions will not only come from in situ data obtained by rover instruments but also from remote sensing data acquired by orbiter instruments. Therefore, it will be essential to link observations at multiple scales by combining rover and orbiter data (e.g., Golombek et al., 2005 , 2008 ; Arvidson et al., 2015 ; Stack et al., 2016 ). An immediate application of such combined data analysis will be the identification of landforms visible in both PanCam and orbiter images, which is key for a precise determination of the landing site location in a global geodetic reference frame (Oberst et al., 1999a , 1999b ; Haase et al., 2012 ). Ideally, such combined analysis will benefit from simultaneous and coordinated observations between PanCam and orbiter instruments enabling cross-calibration for, for example, spectro-photometric investigations (ground truth; e.g., Lichtenberg et al., 2007 ; Hoekzema et al., 2011 ; Fernando et al., 2015 ). Importantly, the need for context information applies to all dimensions and requires 3-D products from PanCam's stereo images (e.g., DTMs) as a spatial reference for other data (e.g., WISDOM, ISEM; Paar et al., 2015 ).\nThe search for biosignatures on Mars is considered to be most promising at sites of ancient geological strata that exhibit morphological, geological, and mineralogical evidence for sustained aqueous activity (e.g., Farmer and Des Marais, 1999 ; Grotzinger et al. 2014 , 2015; Vago et al., 2015 , 2017). The final three candidate landing sites for the ExoMars rover mission (Oxia Planum, Aram Dorsum, Mawrth Vallis) are all characterized by layered deposits suggestive of aqueous activity (depositional and/or alteration) (Bridges et al., 2016a ). Spatially resolved PanCam images and 3-D data products will be essential to study their sedimentary and compositional characteristics. Imaging is necessary to establish the local and regional stratigraphy (e.g., Lewis et al., 2008 ; Edgar et al., 2012 ; Grotzinger et al., 2015 ; Stack et al., 2015 ), for identification of lithologies indicative of aqueous processes (such as the conglomerates in Gale Crater; Williams et al., 2013 ), and for analyzing key sedimentological features such as cross-stratification (Grotzinger et al., 2006 , 2015; Lamb et al., 2012 ) or clinoforms (Grotzinger et al., 2015 ). High-resolution views from the HRC will allow the examination of rock textures (e.g., Herkenhoff et al., 2008 ) and the analysis of particle shape (e.g., Szabó et al., 2015 ; Yingst et al., 2016 ) and grain size distributions (e.g., Grotzinger et al., 2015 ). Smaller grain size measurements, however, require very high image resolution and typically require a microscopic imager (e.g., Jerolmack et al., 2006 ; Edgett et al., 2015 ), and it is likely that PanCam and CLUPI will need to work jointly toward this goal. In theory, PanCam images would also help identify potential morphological biosignatures such as microbially induced sedimentary structures (Noffke, 2009 ). This task, however, will require great care, as distinguishing microbially induced sedimentary structures from abiotic features is challenging (Cady et al., 2003 ; Davies et al., 2016 ) and needs to consider different scales of observation (Ibarra and Corsetti, 2016 ).\nData products derived from PanCam stereo images will permit the quantitative analysis of geological and geomorphic features of interest. A prime example is stratal layer geometry (thickness and attitude, i.e., strike and dip), which can be determined from rover stereo data (e.g., Metz et al., 2009 ; Stack, 2015 ). At larger scales, the geometry of surfaces can be investigated by combining rover images and DTMs derived from orbiter images (e.g., erosional unconformities; Watkins et al., 2016 ). The use of 3-D data is not restricted to sedimentary rock outcrops but will support the study of all surface phenomena. For instance, it also helps to constrain eolian processes (e.g., prevailing paleo-wind directions can be reconstructed from ventifact geometry; Bridges et al., 2014 ) and quantitatively analyze volcanic landforms (Squyres et al., 2007 ; Manga et al., 2012 ). Rock populations have been studied at all previous landing sites (Golombek et al., 2012 ), and PanCam images and 3-D data will be used to characterize their properties and to constrain their provenance (Craddock and Golombek, 2016 ).\nRover images and 3-D data can also support the study of physical properties of rocks (Nahm and Schultz, 2007 ; Okubo, 2007 ) and soils, for example, by viewing the disturbance of the soil by the mechanical interaction with a robotic arm or with rover wheels (e.g., Moore et al., 1987 ; Arvidson et al., 2004 ). Rover telemetry data in combination with rover image data have been used by Arvidson ( 2015 ) and Arvidson et al. ( 2017 ) to analyze the mechanical properties of the soils traversed by the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover, Curiosity.\nIn the case of ExoMars, PanCam will also image the growing accumulation of loose drill material around the borehole to examine its physical properties (e.g., the angle of repose) and mineralogical properties. Indeed, as the MSL rover has shown, the analysis of drill powders provides important information on rock properties below the ubiquitous dust layer and on the weathering profile with depth (e.g., Treiman et al., 2016 ). Importantly, PanCam multi-angle and spectral data (see below) will also enable the study of spectro-photometric properties of the traverse area (Johnson et al., 2008 , 2015 ).\n2.2.2. Rock and soil composition and mineralogy\nOne of the great successes of the Curiosity rover has been the identification of igneous rocks present as clasts from conglomerates of the fluvio-lacustrine system, for example, the Hottah Facies in Gale Crater (Williams et al., 2013 ). For instance, ChemCam compositional analyses together with complementary Mastcam, MAHLI, and ChemCam RMI imagery have shown the presence of feldspar-rich trachybasalts (Sautter et al., 2015 ; Bridges et al., 2016b ), indicating that the Gale catchment contained fractionated igneous rocks in addition to more primitive basalts. PanCam will likewise be able to reveal igneous textures and felsic/mafic mineral proportions, either within clasts in sediments or by imaging of in situ lava flows that have been hypothesized for parts of Oxia Planum (Quantin et al., 2015 ).\nA first-order assessment of the composition of surface materials, including level of oxidation, hydration, and extent of chemical alteration, will be provided by PanCam WAC and HRC color images and selected WAC multispectral data. Analysis of narrowband multispectral images using the “geology” filters ( Table 3 ) will be used to determine spectrally distinct units that can be correlated with structural features identified with WAC DTM data products (e.g., Fig. 2C ), building up a picture of sedimentary or volcanic structure, local stratigraphy, and geochemical evolution. This approach has been used previously to great effect using image data sets from the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Pancams (e.g., Farrand et al., 2006 , 2014 ; Rice et al., 2010 ). Since the deployment of 12-band “geology” multispectral imaging on NASA Pathfinder (Smith et al., 1997 ), subsequent missions have gradually modified the distribution of their geology filters across the 440–1000 nm wavelength range (Gunn and Cousins, 2016 ). Due to the exobiology focus of the ExoMars mission, the PanCam 12-band geology filter set was redesigned for the specific purpose of detecting minerals that had formed in the presence of liquid water (e.g., clays), while maintaining the ability of PanCam to also detect Fe2+- and Fe3+-bearing mineral phases common to Mars (Cousins et al., 2010 , 2012), for which this wavelength range is most sensitive. While these modified filters cover different center wavelengths, many are within 3–9 nm of those flown on previous missions, including the 432, 535, 601, 673, 904, and 1009 nm filters on board the MSL Mastcam and MER Pancams (Anderson and Bell, 2013 ). This enables spectral observations from previous missions to be correlated with those acquired with ExoMars. Analysis of these spectral bands ( Table 1 ), together with the other data sets produced by PanCam (and IR reflectance spectra from ISEM—see Korablev et al., 2017 , in this issue), will enable the identification of evidence of the paleoenvironment's habitability (see Harris et al., 2015 ), forming a major step in deciding where to drill. The ability of PanCam multispectral data products to characterize and distinguish between different mineralogical units produced by argillic alteration of basalt was demonstrated during a field deployment of a PanCam emulator on Mars analog terrains in Iceland (Harris et al., 2015 ).\nView larger version                                     (97K)\nFIG. 2.\nPanCam data products.

Spectral Parameters for ExoMars PanCam\nContext information is essential for the successful interpretation of multispectral data, and other rover missions have used spatially highly resolved imaging data as context for multispectral spot observations. For example, the main camera on the MERs, Pancam (Bell et al., 2003), provided such context for observations made by the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES; e.g., Christensen et al., 2004 ). More recently, the ChemCam instrument on the MSL rover Curiosity was equipped with a Remote Microscopic Imager (RMI) to provide geological context for the Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectrometer (LIBS) measurements (Maurice et al., 2012 ; Le Mouélic et al., 2015 ). In the same way, PanCam's HRC will not only provide context for PanCam's WAC color images but also for the ISEM spectrometer (Korablev et al., 2017 , in this issue). To ensure a common imaging direction and accurate positioning, the optical axes of the HRC and ISEM are coaligned.\n2.2.3. Landing site investigations\nFor the 2020 ExoMars launch, the landing site will be selected from Oxia Planum and one of either Aram Dorsum or Mawrth Vallis (Bridges et al., 2016a ). There are a number of hypotheses for each of the landing sites that will be investigated with PanCam and the other instruments. The final landing ellipse dimensions and azimuths have not been firmly determined for a 2021 landing, but current planning uses a semimajor axis of 50–60 km (Bridges et al., 2016a ).\n2.2.3.1. Oxia Planum (18.14°N, 335.76°E)\nOxia Planum is thought to be a layered, clay-rich Noachian terrain at the southeastern margin of the Chryse region. A long-lived aqueous system is suggested to have existed in Oxia Planum, including the distal deposits of an early Hesperian sedimentary fan that may represent an ancient deltaic sedimentary body (Quantin et al., 2015 ). Several valley systems converge at Oxia Planum, with the proposed delta being at the outlet of Coogoon Valles (Quantin et al., 2016 ).\nIn addition, Oxia Planum has an ancient, finely layered clay-bearing unit with surfaces that have been exposed as recently as 100 Ma (Quantin et al., 2015 ). That region, in the middle and western part of the ellipse, is thought to be part of a 200 m thick phyllosilicate unit, providing primary scientific targets throughout the landing ellipse (Quantin et al., 2014 ). These deposits have similarities with other phyllosilicate deposits, such as those at Mawrth Vallis, that occur throughout the wider western Arabia Terra and Meridiani region (Noe Dobrea et al., 2010 ), suggesting that alteration processes could have been intense over this entire region (Poulet et al., 2005 ).\nThe region also includes a 20 m thick Amazonian capping unit of uncertain, but possible volcanic, origin (Quantin et al., 2014 ). The regions of the phyllosilicate unit that are closest to the capping unit have the strongest CRISM (Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars) signatures for Fe/Mg phyllosilicates (Quantin et al., 2014 , 2015).\n2.2.3.2. Aram Dorsum (7.869°N, 348.8°E)\nAram Dorsum is part of an exhumed inverted fluvial channel system in a regional ancient alluvial landscape (Di Achille and Hynek, 2010 ; Balme et al., 2015 ; Sefton-Nash et al., 2015 ). There are Noachian-aged sedimentary rocks throughout the ellipse, providing scientific imaging targets for PanCam. The system has been exhumed from beneath mid/late Noachian-aged “etched terrains” (e.g., Hynek and Phillips, 2008 ), so the region has been protected from the martian environment for what could have been several billion years.\nAram Dorsum comprises a central inverted “trunk” fluvial channel system with smaller subsidiary channels feeding into it. Traces of buried channels can be seen at various stratigraphic levels, suggestive of a long duration of sediment aggradation (Balme et al., 2015 ; Sefton-Nash et al., 2015 ). The main trunk channel is surrounded by what are interpreted to be floodplain sedimentary deposits (Balme et al., 2014 ). The exposed region of the system is of the order of 10 km wide and 100 km long (Balme et al., 2014 ). The working hypothesis for this site is that it represents a relict aggradational alluvial system that was long-lived and involved migrating fluvial channels (Balme et al., 2014 ). Thus, it hosted a variety of alluvial depositional environments and likely comprised sedimentary rocks displaying a variety of grain sizes. The predicted long-duration nature of the system, and the potential for fine-grained alluvial sediments, makes Aram Dorsum a potentially good location for preserved biosignatures.\nAt the time of writing, there are very few CRISM images available for Aram Dorsum, with dust coverage obscuring the images that are available. However, at nearby Miyamoto Crater, Fe/Mg phyllosilicates were found on both sides of the channel (Marzo et al., 2009 ; Balme et al., 2015 ). The similarity in setting has been taken as an indication that Aram Dorsum could also contain similar phyllosilicates (Balme et al., 2015 )—again adding to the potential for biosignature preservation.\n2.2.3.3. Mawrth Vallis (22.16°N, 342.05°E)\nMawrth Vallis has abundant Fe/Mg phyllosilicates and associated layered terrains (Loizeau et al., 2010 , 2015 ). It is a well studied, mineralogically diverse site (Bishop et al., 2008 ), which together with its stratigraphy has been taken to suggest aqueous systems and a rich aqueous history (e.g., Michalski et al., 2010 ). It is predicted that biosignatures could be retained in the phyllosilicate and hydrated silica deposits, especially as there is no evidence for mixed-layer clays that would degrade the biosignatures (Poulet et al., 2014 ). In addition, the high clay content in Mawrth Vallis might allow organic preservation in paleosol paleoenvironments (Poulet et al., 2015 ). Reduced paleosols are thought to be excellent scientific targets, as reducing soils cause immediate preservation and therefore can concentrate organics (Poulet et al., 2014 ; Gross et al., 2016 ). There are clay transitions within the landing ellipse, transitioning from Fe-smectite to overlying Al-clays (kaolinite), as can be seen in CRISM images (Poulet et al., 2015 ).\nThe landing site at Mawrth Vallis is part of a large area with widespread layered deposits and evidence for draping relationships between some of them (Poulet et al., 2014 ). Erosional landforms superposed on the clay-rich succession are also present, such as channels and small capped buttes and mesas. Furthermore, as there are few “boulder-forming” units and the thermal inertia is low, it is assumed that the region is formed at least in part from fine-grained sedimentary rocks (Poulet et al., 2014 ). There is also a capping unit in Mawrth Vallis, which is thought to have buried the exobiology regions of interest. Like Aram Dorsum, these have been exhumed in geologically recent times (Poulet et al., 2015 ), which improves the biosignature preservation potential.\nGiven the three potential landing sites, the identification and measurement of sedimentary structures and determination of the sedimentary facies and stratigraphy will be an essential part of the ExoMars rover mission. Working hypotheses for the geological context will be developed—and here, PanCam's capabilities will be central—and used to interpret the paleoenvironments that the sedimentary rocks formed in. From here, the ExoMars science team will choose which locales to target and sample using the other instruments.\nThe key hypotheses and questions that PanCam will be deployed to help test and address at whichever of the landing sites is chosen are as follows:\n(I) If Oxia Planum is the site, (i) What is the nature and depositional environment of the clay-bearing units? (ii) Are the Oxia clays truly the lower members of the more varied clay sequence observed at Mawrth? Is this a major regional alteration landscape? (iii) If the rover can reach the geographically constrained fan-shaped landform, is it a delta? (iv) Is the capping unit in Oxia Planum volcanic?\n(II) (i) Is Aram Dorsum an exhumed, alluvial depositional system? (ii) If so, are fine-grained floodplain and local lacustrine deposits present? (iii) Are phyllosilicates present in the Aram Dorsum region?\n(III) (i) What are the depositional or diagenetic environments for the various clay mineral–hosting strata documented at Mawrth Vallis? (ii) Does Mawrth Vallis contain evidence for paleosols? (iii) What is the significance and nature of the transition from Fe-smectite to Al-clays?\n2.2.4. Support of exobiology\nPanCam data will support the overarching exobiological objective of ExoMars through the characterization of paleoenvironments that involved sustained liquid water at the ExoMars study site. While water alone does not ensure habitability (e.g., Knoll and Grotzinger, 2006 ; Grotzinger et al. 2014 ; Fox-Powell et al., 2016 ), it provides the basis for current exobiological exploration of Mars (Rummel et al., 2014 ). Since 2012, MSL Curiosity MastCam data have revealed evidence of fluvio-lacustrine sedimentary deposits (Grotzinger et al., 2014 , 2015) and diagenetic veins and related mineralogy (McLennan et al., 2014 ; Nachon et al., 2014 ; Bridges et al., 2015 ; Schwenzer et al., 2016 ). Critical information for construction of the stratigraphic framework of sedimentary rocks along the rover traverse and their sedimentological and paleoenvironmental interpretation has been provided by MastCam, including images of fluvial conglomerates (Williams et al., 2013 ), a variety of cross-stratification structures, fine-scale lamination indicative of lacustrine sedimentation, and sulfate and Mg-rich veins cutting though the sediments (Grotzinger et al., 2014 , 2015).\nMastCam observations have also demonstrated how large-scale stratigraphic relationships between geological units along the rover traverse can be understood within the context of CRISM mineralogical data (Seelos et al., 2014 ; Grotzinger et al., 2015 ). The role of PanCam on ExoMars will be much the same, and its combination of wide-angle, high-resolution, 3-D, and multispectral visualization ( Fig. 2 ) will enable a thorough evaluation of the geological context for both drill-site selection and subsequent interpretation of sample analyses. Specific to ExoMars is the necessity to identify those lithologies most likely to harbor evidence for organic biosignatures (Farmer and Des Marais, 1999 ; Parnell et al., 2007 ), and the degree and type of post-depositional processes that have affected them. To this end, identification of reduced, phyllosilicate-bearing sediments will be a particular priority due to the hypothesis of preferential preservation of organic matter by clay minerals (Ehlmann et al., 2008 ). PanCam (HRC and WAC) will be an important tool in this, but this will be augmented by the use of a relevant suite of spectrometers (e.g., ISEM and the Raman spectrometer). The three potential landing sites satisfy this criterion, having either spectral evidence for abundant clays (Oxia Planum, Mawrth Vallis) or geological features that suggest environments where fine-grained sediment is likely to have accumulated (Aram Dorsum).\nDetermination of the subsurface stratigraphic extent of candidate sampling strata through combining PanCam DTMs of rock outcrops with WISDOM data (Ciarletti et al., 2017 , in this issue) will also be a key input into deciding where to drill. The three landing sites are all hypothesized to contain fine-grained sedimentary rocks. Burial of such deposits is likely to have been associated with diagenesis, for example, the formation of clay and iron oxide through the dissolution of olivine, and the creation of secondary mineral veins (Léveillé et al., 2014 ; Bridges et al., 2015 ). The role of post-emplacement diagenetic processes is of particular importance given the ability of diagenetic processes either to mineralize (preserve) or destroy/displace organic biosignatures, in addition to UV and oxidative degradation of organic material (ten Kate, 2010 ). A key finding from the MSL Curiosity mission has been the prevalence of diagenetic hydrated calcium sulfate fracture-fill veins, which formed from circumneutral fluids at relatively low temperatures (<50°C) and pressures (Nachon et al., 2014 ; Schwenzer et al., 2016 ). Remote detection of deposits such as these with PanCam will be achieved through a combination of WAC multispectral (color, hydration band identification) and HRC (mineral vein morphology and crystal habits) data. Likewise, combined HRC and WAC multispectral data will also be used to detect other low-temperature secondary mineralization features that have the potential to trap organic matter during precipitation, including evaporitic salt phases, zeolite mineralization, and carbonates, which can then be corroborated with ISEM spectral data to identify and spatially extrapolate their mineralogy across a PanCam scene.\n2.2.5. Atmospheric science\nThe major changes on the martian surface that can be detected by PanCam are caused by eolian processes and condensation of volatiles, which directly reflect variations in the prevailing near-surface wind regime, and the diurnal and seasonal volatile and dust cycles. Atmospheric studies will concentrate on the detection of clouds, measurements of the aerosol contents, and the water vapor absorption at 936 nm (Titov et al., 1999 ). Although currently present at only ∼30 ppm near the surface, the atmospheric water vapor distribution is vital to understanding the water exchange with the regolith and its loss to space. It may also be affected at high altitudes by any nearby crustal magnetic fields. The abundance of water vapor in the instrument line of sight will be inferred by measuring the 936 nm absorption feature, utilizing the 925 nm (continuum) and 935 nm solar filters ( Table 3 ). By direct imaging of the setting Sun, this feature will be measured as a function of zenith angle, to probe vertical distribution in the near-surface layers. These properties of abundance and vertical profile will be retrieved with the radiative transfer and retrieval tool NEMESIS (Non-linear optimal Estimator for MultivariatE Spectral analysIS) (Irwin et al., 2008 ). NEMESIS is a versatile tool designed for application to any planet and has retrieved vertical water vapor distributions at Mars (Lolachi et al., 2007 ) as well as atmospheric properties of Titan (Teanby et al., 2007 ), Saturn (Fletcher et al., 2007 ), Jupiter (Irwin et al., 2004 ), and Venus (De Kok et al., 2011 ), for a range of viewing geometries.\nScattering by dust particles (aerosols) controls the quantity of light in the sky and its spectral distribution (Thomas et al., 1999 ). Dust particles stripped from dust layers on the ground and ice, nucleated together, are important components of the aerosol load in the atmosphere. The vertical optical depth of aerosols in the atmosphere of Mars varies strongly, depending on meteorological conditions such as temperature and atmospheric pressure. The results obtained at the MER and MSL landing sites concerning atmospheric conditions were discussed by Smith et al. ( 2006 ), Moores et al. ( 2013 ), and Webster et al. ( 2013 ). PanCam will use images of the sky observed near sunset to determine scattering properties of the dust particles via simulation with NEMESIS (Kleinböhl et al., 2011 ), in conjunction with observations from meteorology packages on the ExoMars landing platform. The coordination of multiple instrument observations of optical depth has been successful in constraining aerosol properties over previous missions (Lemmon et al., 2004 ; Wolff et al., 2006 ). The variation of scattering properties with altitude may be inferred by observing the sky after sunset, when increasingly higher levels in the atmosphere are illuminated by sunlight (Markiewicz et al., 1999 ).\nIn addition to studies of dust particles and other aerosols, lander- and rover-based cameras have been used successfully to study and monitor cloud activity on Mars (e.g., Moores et al., 2010 , 2015 ), and PanCam will continue this endeavor, including using automated techniques (e.g., Francis et al., 2014 ).\nThe observations of these atmospheric properties across the mission duration will provide temporal data, contributing to the optical depth record accumulated and reviewed by Lemmon et al. ( 2015 ). The collected observations made by the ExoMars rover, landing platform instruments, and Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) will provide further insights into the characteristics and evolution of the martian atmosphere.\n2.3. Operational planning\nThe planning of all rover operations relies heavily on visual information provided by various camera systems (e.g., Bell et al., 2003). The ExoMars rover will have a nominal lifetime of 218 sols (approximately 7 Earth months). During this period, a total drive distance of several kilometers is expected (Vago et al., 2017 , in this issue). To plan drives and analytical campaigns, a daily process of localization and navigation planning will be necessary. This will make use of the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in particular, and to some extent imagery from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on Mars Express and the Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS) on the ExoMars 2016 TGO, together with the ExoMars rover navigation and localization cameras. Complementary to the onboard guidance navigation and control (GNC, Winter et al., 2015 ), which performs relative localization in reaction to a predefined local path, absolute localization [both for strategic (daily) and tactical (longer-term) planning] will be performed in the Rover Operations and Control Center (ROCC) at the ALTEC premises in Turin. The PanCam 3-D vision workflow PRoViP (Paar et al., 2009 ; see also Section 5.3 in this paper) will be able to interpret PanCam, NavCam, and Localization Camera (LocCam) data and generate 3-D vision products (panoramas and DTMs). These data are expected to be available on a daily basis to be used for scientific planning for that sol.\nFor absolute localization, given that high-resolution satellite DTMs/ortho images in the range of 0.5 m resolution or better are available, rover DTMs are projected into an orthorectified mosaic, which uses the XYZ location of each pixel to create a true overhead view. These mosaics are then compared with orbital (e.g., HiRISE) views of the terrain to pinpoint exactly where the rover is in terms of latitude and longitude on the martian surface (Tao et al., 2016 ). A Path Planning module based on the local DTM will facilitate the long-term route planning. A traverse-monitoring map will show areas within which the rover is allowed to enter or not.\nPanCam single images, mosaics, and stereo products will provide essential higher-resolution views of potential scientific targets, sometimes with geology filters. It is envisaged that some PanCam imagery and stereo DTMs will be available in the daily cycle of downloads, with the number of PanCam products varying according to scientific priorities and data downlink rates. A key strength of ExoMars science is expected to be the rapid integration of PanCam stereo imagery with additional 3-D information into the science and drive planning process.\n2.4. Synergies with other instruments\nAn important scientific property of the Pasteur payload instruments is their ability to contribute to the successive chain of observations aiming to collect the best possible samples for analysis. PanCam is the first link in this chain.\nThe PanCam WACs will obtain panoramic scale information needed to characterize the rover's surroundings. Without the need to move the rover, PanCam HRC, in combination with the IR spectrometer ISEM, can secure detailed, high-resolution visual and spectral data on faraway candidate targets. Armed with these results, the science team can make an informed decision regarding which geological targets to inspect at close range.\nOnce the rover has reached a scientifically interesting objective, for example, a sedimentary rock outcrop that could have been deposited in an aqueous environment, PanCam WAC, PanCam HRC, and ISEM can work in a concerted manner to study the target. This characterization can be used to determine which portion of the outcrop to investigate at very high resolution with CLUPI, the close-up imager accommodated on the ExoMars drill.\nPanCam can also support rover operations when performing subsurface scanning maneuvers. These are predefined trajectories executed by the rover in order to construct 2-D and 3-D models using the WISDOM Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and the ADRON neutron detector. They allow the determination of, respectively, the subsurface stratigraphy under the rover (including the existence of potential obstacles) and the subsoil's level of hydration—both important for deciding where to drill.\nPanCam and CLUPI can work in tandem to visually examine outcrops and rocks at progressively higher resolution, that is, overall views with the WACs, imaging at millimeter scale with the HRC, and detailed textural studies at tens-of-microns scale with CLUPI.\nPanCam and CLUPI can also monitor drilling operations. As the drill penetrates into the ground, a mound of fines will be collected at its base. CLUPI can obtain very detailed images of these fines at 39 and 13 (drill lowered) μm/pixel (Josset et al., 2017, in this issue). However, via the RIM, or once the rover has backed away, it is the PanCam HRC that can inspect the entire collection of fines, revealing any heterogeneity in the grains. This information can be compared with the borehole wall data obtained by the Ma_MISS IR spectrometer integrated in the drill tip.\nFinally, the PanCam HRC and CLUPI are tasked with imaging the sample deposited by the drill on the Core Sample Transport Mechanism (CSTM)—a small drawer emerging through a port on the front of the rover to receive the sample. Once again, CLUPI can obtain high-resolution images (∼20 μm/pixel) of portions of the sample, but the PanCam HRC will achieve a top view of the complete sample prior to its delivery to the analytical laboratory for further processing and analysis.\nIn summary, the use of PanCam in synergy with all the rover's external instruments constitutes a major requirement for achieving the mission's scientific objectives.\nAlthough not strictly an instrument, the rover locomotion system itself (Poulakis et al., 2015 ) will provide PanCam with numerous scientific opportunities, for example, wheel-soil interaction studies based on mechanical properties of the terrain material that the rover will traverse, which can be assessed with PanCam and CLUPI. The results of these investigations will help improve predictions for tractive performance of flexible wheels on different terrains and slopes (the rover includes wheel slip sensors and is able to assess effective traverse progress optically). The wheels of the rover can also be used to conduct trenching observations (planned or otherwise) where PanCam and CLUPI can directly inspect (shallow) excavated material deemed interesting.\n3. Instrument Design\n3.1. Instrument overview\nThe PanCam design (total mass 2.13 kg with margin) includes the following major items:\n(a) Wide Angle Camera (WAC) pair, for multispectral stereoscopic panoramic imaging, using a miniaturized filter wheel. The WAC units themselves are provided by RUAG and Space-X, Switzerland, and the filter wheels and drives are produced by Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL), University College London (UCL).\n(b) High Resolution Camera (HRC) for high-resolution color images. The HRC hardware is produced by OHB, Oberfaffenhofen, and DLR Institute for Planetary Research, Berlin, Germany.\n(c) PanCam Interface Unit and DC-DC converter (PIU and DCDC) to provide a single electronic interface. The PIU and DCDC are provided by MSSL-UCL.\n(d) PanCam Optical Bench (OB) to house PanCam and provide planetary and dust protection. The OB is provided by MSSL-UCL.\nThe PanCam mechanical design is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The OB is located on a rover-supplied pan-tilt mechanism at the top of the rover mast, at a height of ∼2 m above the surface (Silva et al., 2013 ).\nA summary of the main characteristics of PanCam is shown in Table 2 .\nTable 2. Main PanCam Characteristics and Resources\nEach of the WACs includes 11 filters comprising R, G, and B color bands, a geological filter set [optimized for use on Mars by Cousins et al. ( 2010 , 2012 )], and atmospheric filters to analyze the water and dust content in the martian atmosphere. The filter wheel and WAC system are illustrated in Fig. 4 .\nView larger version                                     (51K)\nFIG. 4.\nFront and rear CAD views of the right WAC assembly, showing the filter wheel and stepper motor. The left WAC and right WAC filter sets are not identical; they include RGB, narrow-band geology, and solar.\nInformation about Downloading\nThe HRC includes R, G, and B filters bonded to the detector chips to provide color information. The optical path is housed within the OB structure and comprises a baffle and mirror arrangement, a focus mechanism, and a detector with associated readout electronics (see Fig. 5 ).\nInformation about Downloading\nThe PIU is the main interface between the ExoMars rover and the PanCam subsystems, and uses an FPGA implementation. The final system component is the OB, which provides a planetary protection barrier to the external environment (including HEPA filters), as well as mechanical positioning of the PanCam components. A view of the structural-thermal model (STM) OB is shown in Fig. 6 .\nInformation about Downloading\nIn addition to the four major PanCam OB-mounted components outlined above, three additional “Small Items” hardware components are part of the PanCam design to improve the scientific return and provide useful engineering data. These are the calibration target (shared with ISEM), fiducial markers, and a rover inspection mirror (see Section 3.5). We note that data formatting and compression are performed within the rover electronics system.\n3.2. Wide angle cameras (WACs) and filter wheel\nEach WAC contains a STAR1000 APS-based camera with wide-angle optics and a filter wheel containing 11 filters ( Figs. 4 and 7 ).\nView larger version                                     (27K)\nFIG. 7.\nWAC block diagram showing the STAR1000 CMOS sensor with temperature sensor, the FPGA and image memory, connector, and LVDS drivers.\nInformation about Downloading\nThe 1 megapixel (1024 × 1024) STAR1000 detector is digitized to 10 bits with the onboard ADC. This CMOS active pixel sensor (APS) detector was selected to reduce the number of voltage lines required and the complexity of the support circuitry (compared to a traditional CCD sensor), thus allowing lighter, more compact camera heads to be designed. The STAR1000 was developed to be extremely radiation resistant (∼100 Krad, Cos et al., 2006 ) for long-duration geostationary missions and has flown previously as a star tracker detector (Schmidt et al., 2015 ). It was selected at a phase in the ExoMars mission evolution when a 1.5–2 year interplanetary cruise phase near solar maximum was foreseen. The sensor is currently in flight on the Mascot lander aboard the Hyabusa 2 spacecraft (Jaumann et al., 2016 ) and will be further qualified, for the demanding ∼200 thermal cycles it will see on the surface of Mars, as part of a life test model as part of the PanCam Assembly, Integration, and Test (AIT) phase. The product of quantum efficiency and fill factor of the STAR1000 is above 20% for most of the visible (i.e., 470–710 nm) but falls monotonically to 7% at 400 nm and only 3% at 1000 nm. To compensate for these quantum efficiency limitations, the WAC filter band passes systematically increase at both long and short wavelengths ( Table 3 ), maintaining relatively constant integration times by increasing the light energy reaching the sensor [as described in the filter selection paper by Cousins et al. ( 2012 )].\nTable 3. WAC Filter Properties for the Left Filter Wheel (Top Half) and the Right Filter Wheel (Bottom Half)\nThe fixed-focus, f = 21.85 mm optics provide in-focus images from approximately 0.85 m to infinity (optimized for 1.9 m). PSF modeling indicates >80% of a point source's energy is contained within the central 15-micron square pixel. This figure is a worst-case value for the edge of the field with performance improving toward the optical axis. The data from the detector are digitized to 10 bits. Stereo images are acquired with a 500 mm baseline and 2.8° toe-in (per “eye”), optimized for stereo vision at 5 m from the rover. The broadband red color filters in both WACs are used for stereo imaging, while in the same sequence images are taken through the green and blue broadband filters from one WAC (known as “RRGB”) to produce an RGB color texture to “drape” over the 3-D terrain model recovered from the stereo data. PanCam is mounted on top of the rover deployable mast array (DMA) some 2 m above the martian surface. From this position it can be panned (around the vertical axis) ±180° and tilted (around the horizontal axis) ±90°, from the straight-ahead position. This allows the WACs to image the PanCam Calibration Target (PCT) and Fiducial Markers (FidMs) on the rover deck and science targets on the (unobscured) martian surface and in the sky above the rover.\nEach WAC is composed of a gold-colored cube containing the power, memory, and sensor PCBs embedded in a protective epoxy attached to the 53° (diagonal) FOV lens. Unlike the HRC, the WAC design [incorporating over 20 years of development heritage—e.g., Beauvivre et al. ( 1999 ), Josset et al. ( 2006 ), Griffiths et al. ( 2005 )] calls for standalone modules containing 512 Mbits of memory storage for up to 50 images. The WAC is mounted to the OB just behind an 11-position filter wheel, turned by a stepper motor via a 64:1 gearbox (0.28° of filter wheel rotation per motor step). A Hall effect sensor detects magnets located along the periphery of the wheel (and also at the home position) to allow the PIU to determine the current filter location.\nThe 22 (total) filters are divided into three functional groups: 2 × R, G & B broadband color imaging filters (6), narrow-band geology filters in the 400–1000 nm wavelength range (12), and ultra-narrow-band solar filters (4) for dust optical density and water vapor absorption studies. The solar filters include a factor of ∼10−5 band pass attenuation to allow solar imaging without the detector saturating at even the minimum integration time. The filter center wavelength, pass band, and other properties are shown in Table 3 . Since data bandwidth limits will rarely allow the use of all 12 geology filters on extended targets, ratios of certain filters (shown with bold IDs in Table 3 )—for example, G03 and G05; G02, G06, and G01; and G07, G10, G11, and G12—will be used to identify diagnostic slopes, knees, or bands expected from hydrated clays, salts, or other minerals of exobiological interest (Harris et al., 2015 ).\n3.3. High Resolution Camera (HRC)\nThe PanCam HRC will be one of the few landscape-viewing cameras on Mars to be equipped with active focus capability, enabling it to reveal details near or far with about 8-fold better resolution than the WACs (and comparable to the 100 mm focal length, MastCam100 on the Curiosity rover).\nIn particular, HRC images will allow for high-resolution views of “Regions of Interest” within WAC wide-angle panoramas, as well as high-resolution imaging of rover-inaccessible locations on, for example, crater walls or in valleys. Combined with the RIM, placed at the front end of the rover body, high-resolution engineering images of the rover underside as well as views of the rover wheels for soil mechanics science or views of the underside of overhanging rock formations can be acquired.\nThe HRC is physically located inside the PanCam OB. The position of the viewing port next to the right WAC has been optimized to provide a top view of retrieved subsurface samples deposited by the drill on the CSTM.\nThe optical design is centered on a STAR1000 1024 × 1024 pixel CMOS detector, with 15 μm pixel size. Illuminated by a 180 mm EFL, f/16 lens (Cooke triplet), the detector enables detailed images of near and distant objects: the 4.88° square FOV takes images with a scale of ∼0.17 mm per pixel at 2 m distance and 8.5 cm per pixel at 1 km distance. PSF modeling indicates >70% of a point source's energy is contained within the central 15-micron square pixel. This figure is a worst-case value for the edge of the field with performance improving toward the optical axis. Physically, the HRC consists of the focal plane and control electronics PCBs, the focus drive stage with the lens barrel on top, the folding mirror assembly, and the entrance window (see Figs. 8 and 9 ). A major difference from the WAC is that the HRC lacks local image storage memory; instead, to simplify the design, the image data are transmitted directly to the PIU and buffered there. From the entrance window, the light is directed through an external and internal stray light baffle onto a 45° folding mirror. Inside the OB, an internal short wall carries a second internal baffle that directs the light onto the Cooke-triplet lens.\nView larger version                                     (32K)\nFIG. 9.\nHRC block diagram showing the STAR1000 CMOS sensor with temperature sensor, the FPGA (center), connectors, power conditioning, and LVDS drivers (right) and finally the focus motor control circuitry (left).\nInformation about Downloading\nTo enable active focusing, the lens group sits on a focus drive stage, which is mechanically actuated by a stepper motor for obtaining well-focused images between ∼1 m (distance to the sample on the CSTM) and infinity. Through a second short wall and third internal baffle, the light finally reaches the focal plane with the image sensor.\nThe HRC uses the same monochrome APS as the two WACs. However, instead of a filter wheel, an affixed red-green-blue filter strip over the CMOS detector is used. 1 Covering the spectral range from 440 to 654 nm (at FWHM), the three filter bands (covering, respectively, 342, 341, and 341 pixels horizontally) are blue (475 ± 35 nm), green (542.5 ± 22.5 nm), and red (635 ± 19 nm)—see Fig. 10 . For color image acquisition, using the three stripe filters on the detector, the camera head has to be panned over the full FOV to mosaic each color swath across the detector FOV. We note that optical testing of the HRC elegant breadboard revealed stray light issues relating to the filter; these have been mitigated by adding a black coating to the filter edges.\nView larger version                                     (32K)\nFIG. 10.\n(Left) RGB strip filter, directly glued onto the active area of the STAR1000 detector. (Right) Filter transmission curve of the RGB filter strips.\nInformation about Downloading\nConnected to the focal plane via a flex layer is the control electronics PCB, which houses all HRC electronics, including camera control, autofocus and autofocus motor control, and interface control.\nTo satisfy the stringent alignment requirements, the focal plane is placed on an isostatically mounted bracket. Shims between the focal plane bracket and the OB, as well as shims between the folding mirror bracket and OB, can be used to further adjust height and angular alignment during integration.\nThe autofocus algorithm is newly developed by the HRC team. An adapted global search strategy is used to search for the sharpest image within the focus range. The sharpness of an image is determined within a 32 × 32, 64 × 64, 128 × 128, or 256 × 256 window by Sobel filtering and calculation of the mean of the root-squared image gradients in x and y direction. The sharpness at the initial motor position is calculated by moving the motor either forward or backward depending on the current focus position, with a step length of 3 mm. Again, the image sharpness is calculated, and the motor movement direction is changed if the sharpness is lower than the initial sharpness. Then, steps of 1 mm are executed, and the image sharpness is calculated iteratively until a coarse global maximum sharpness is found. At the final stage, the step size is reduced to find the global maximum image sharpness. Although range estimation is not required for the HRC autofocus, the drive stage can be set by command at a position calculated based on range-to-target information from the WAC stereo products.\n3.4. Optical bench (OB)\nPanCam's internal components are contained in an OB. An OB was selected to provide the instrument with protection from the martian environment (e.g., dust) and to provide the martian environment protection from any contaminants brought from Earth by the instrument. The OB is vented with a HEPA filter to equalize pressure but maintain cleanliness. In addition, the rigidity of the OB helps maintain a stable structure from which to acquire stereo imaging.\nThe OB is of aluminum construction with dimensions of 562 × 70 × 113 mm (L × H × D). The walls are machined from a single aluminum block, and afterward the interior is cut out by using electrical discharge machining wire cutting. Wire cutting allows the OB to have thinner walls than could be machined from a solid block, resulting in a lightweight rigid structure.\nThe base is electron-beam welded to the wall structure, and the lid is secured to the top of the bench by a series of fasteners once the internal components are mounted. In this configuration, the box makes a very stiff, extremely light monocoque structure. The mass of the OB itself, including 12% margin, is just under 780 g.\nThe interior of the OB is painted with a black paint (Z306) to cut down on stray light. Aeroglaze Z-306 has a reflectance of ∼8% BoL in the visible (Gilmore, 2002 ) and a few percent in the NIR (Ames, 1990 ). The exterior of the OB is coated with A276, a space-qualified white paint that aids PanCam thermal control. Equally importantly, A276 is compatible with ExoMars planetary protection guidelines; it is glossy and smooth, so it is less likely to harbor spores and other bioburden. It can also withstand dry heat microbial reduction sterilization.\n3.5. Supporting electronics—PanCam Interface Unit (PIU) + DC-DC converter (DCDC)\nThe function of the PIU is to provide a single interface for all three cameras to the rover and this is achieved by using the SpaceWire RMAP interface protocol. The PIU receives the SpaceWire RMAP packets and executes them as required and forwarding the command to the cameras. Due to power constraints, only a single camera can be powered at any one time. The active camera is selected by the PIU using power switches.\nSingle alternating WAC operation (e.g., during stereo image acquisition) is not expected to present problems maintaining operating temperature. This is because thermal modeling indicates that the low thermal conductance to the OB means that one camera is unlikely to cool significantly in the few minutes it is switched off (while the other is acquiring the matching image in the stereo pair). Alternating camera use during a sequence of stereo pairs allows heat loss from each camera to be minimized.\nThe PIU is responsible for control of the filter wheels. The PIU maintains locally the Rover Elapsed Time (RET) in order to allow time-stamping of HK packets and image data. In addition to time stamps, images can be identified by a unique image ID that is embedded in the image metadata and contains parameters such as the sol date and task ID. Owing to PanCam's position on the end of the mast and again to power limitations, the instrument does not have any survival heaters and follows the martian surface temperature.\nTherefore, the cameras will generally be operated during the day when surface temperatures are above −40°C (to reduce power required for heating). An exception may be the solar observations just prior to sunset (sunrise observations likely being precluded by power and thermal restrictions). However, since the rover is solar powered, it is similarly limited to daytime operations when the dust opacity is low enough to enable (and any seasonal constraints allow) a suitable operating power margin to be maintained (Vago, 2012 ).\nGiven this, the PIU provides autonomous camera unit temperature control and monitoring with secondary power for the heaters. Moreover, the PIU is responsible for the control of the filter wheels. The performance and state of PanCam is monitored though the Housekeeping packets generated by the PIU. These Housekeeping packets are also used by the rover to detect any off-nominal behavior and take the appropriate actions.\nA single DC-DC converter, which is housed in a dedicated compartment of the OB, provides the galvanically isolated secondary rails as required by the rest of the instrument. The DC-DC converter converts the 28 V primary power bus to three different voltages:\n• 12 V, used to drive the filter wheels and the HRC focus actuator;\n• 6 V, which powers the various digital components (switched to power the cameras as needed);\n• 1.5 V, used by the PanCam FPGA.\nThe DC-DC converter incorporates a number of features such as current limiting designed to safeguard the rest of the instrument in the event of a component failure or upset.\n3.6. Small Items\nThe PanCam “Small Items” consist of additional passive hardware to aid the surface operations of PanCam and allow in situ calibration. These items include the PCT, the FidMs, and the RIM. The PCT and FidMs are mounted on the rover deck and the RIM on the left-hand suspension bogie bracket as shown in Fig. 11 .\nInformation about Downloading\n3.6.1. PanCam Calibration Target (PCT)\nThe PCT provides an in situ calibration target for the radiometric calibration of PanCam on the martian surface. The PCT has a mass of 36.2 g excluding mounting screws and consists of an aluminum structure with a surface area of 67 × 76 mm, which mechanically retains eight colored glass and ceramic calibration patches. Six of the calibration patches (red, yellow, green/blue, blue, and two gray) have an exposed diameter of 18 mm and will be used only for PanCam calibration. Colored glass was selected for the calibration patches, as the color has excellent resistance to UV-induced fading and damage from the moderate doses of ionizing radiation it will encounter during the mission. The surfaces of the calibration patches are processed to obtain a diffuse reflection, and the back surface is aluminized to increase the total reflectance. The glass for the six small calibration patches is standard Schott colored and neutral-density filter glass.\nThe white and multiband calibration patches have an exposed diameter of 30 mm and will be used for the radiometric and spectral calibration of ISEM (Korablev et al., 2017 , in this issue) in addition to PanCam. WCT-2065 (a rare earth doped glass developed by NIST and manufactured by Schott) is used to provide well-defined bands for spectral calibration applications in the visible and NIR. The white calibration patch is Pyroceram manufactured by the Vavilov State Optical Institute in St. Petersburg.\nThe calibration patches will be calibrated for absolute reflectance in total hemispherical/8° geometry and BRDF so that the angle of incident solar illumination can be compensated for. The PCT includes two shadow posts to allow the level of indirect (scattered) skylight to be assessed and aid in the determination of the illumination direction and angle.\nThe PCT is mounted on the front of the rover deck in a region as clear as possible from sources of shadowing and stray light and will be viewed by PanCam from an angle of ∼23° from the vertical. Measurements of the light scattered by the PCT will allow the level of incident illumination to be determined over the PanCam and ISEM spectral range. In combination with preflight calibration data, these measurements will allow PanCam images to be processed to obtain calibrated data products such as spectral parameter images and relative reflectance spectra of objects in the FOV.\nDust deposition on the PCT during the ExoMars mission will be accounted for in the data processing by developing a radiative transfer model of the PCT/dust system, building on the results of previous missions (Johnson et al., 2002 ; Bell et al., 2006; Kinch et al., 2007 , 2015 ). This will use laboratory measurements of Mars analog dust (JSC Mars-1; Allen et al., 1997 ) on the PCT prototype as with the MER calibration target (Johnson et al., 2006 ) and measurements of settling rates derived from the rover solar array power output (Stella et al., 2005 ).\n3.6.2. Fiducial Markers (FidMs)\nTogether with the PCT, the three FidMs form two right-angle triangles on the rover deck to allow in situ geometric calibration of the PTU/PanCam system. Each FidM consists of a single piece of aluminum, anodized black and with the center section ground back to aluminum to provide high contrast. The center hole in each FidM provides a mounting point for geometric reference targets for preflight calibration activities. The FidMs have dimensions of 32 × 16 × 6.5 mm and a mass of 1.2 g excluding mounting screws.\n3.6.3. Rover Inspection Mirror (RIM)\nThe RIM is a 50 mm diameter convex spherical mirror machined and polished from aluminum, with a radius of curvature of 30 mm mounted on an aluminum bracket. The RIM assembly has a mass of 21.8 g excluding mounting screws. The RIM will be imaged by the HRC and will allow the drill spoil heap to be observed while drilling is taking place. It will also allow the underside of the rover to be observed for diagnosis in the event of problems with uneven surfaces, the drivetrain, and so on. The RIM will also allow the PanCam instrument to take “selfies” of the rover for publicity and outreach purposes.\n4. Measurement Scenario\n4.1. Usage of PanCam\nThe ExoMars mission plan is to explore the martian terrain near the landing site using a series of six experiment cycles and two vertical surveys (Vago et al., 2015 , 2017). The rover will target outcrops as indicators of buried rock masses that may extend below the radiation-altered and oxidized layers to depths of >1.5 m where molecular fossils may have survived for billions of years.\nA “reference surface mission,” involving experiment cycles, has been designed to provide the necessary requirements for sizing the rover. The discussion in this section is based on that existing plan, which also provides a rough template for achieving the main scientific goals during the nominal surface mission. We fully appreciate that the detailed planning for Mars operations will vary significantly from this scenario. Inputs from the science and engineering teams for PanCam and other instruments will be generated on a daily basis as the mission progresses, in reaction to the martian terrain and environment and to the state of the rover.\nIn an experiment cycle (EC), the rover uses the Pasteur payload (over a period of 14 sols, with another 4 sols reserved for traveling between EC sites) to home in on a suitable outcrop from which to acquire samples (Vago, 2012 ). For particularly promising EC sites, a vertical survey can be conducted where samples are returned every 50 cm from the surface to the maximum drilling depth of 2 m.\nThe EC can be divided into an approach phase (3–4 sols) and a sampling phase (10–11 sols). At the beginning of the approach phase, the rover can be up to 20 m distant from a possible drill target, so a PanCam WAC panorama of up to 10 RRGB color/stereo images of the area ahead of the rover is acquired on the first sol. At the same time, HRC RGB color images and co-registered ISEM spectra (Korablev et al., 2017 , in this issue) of promising rocks (seen during the ∼100 m drive from the previous EC location) are acquired. From these data, an outcrop target will be chosen for the rover to approach to ∼3 m on the second sol. ADRON (Mitrofanov et al., 2017 , in this issue) and WISDOM (Ciarletti et al., 2017 , in this issue) surveys are conducted during the approach phase. A WAC image using either all 12 geology filters or selected groups (as discussed in Section 3.1) is taken of the outcrop along with a mosaic of eight HRC color images (and again eight co-registered ISEM spectra). Then on the third sol, a HRC color context image is taken of the potential drill target area to be imaged in greater detail by CLUPI. Subsequently, CLUPI will acquire up to six images (with depth from focus position information) to characterize rock microtexture and select a location to drill. Finally, on the forth sol of the approach phase, a surface sample is acquired and imaged by the HRC and CLUPI before ingestion into the ALD by the HRC and CLUPI. In this way, PanCam forms part of the “remote sensing” part of the Pasteur payload (along with WISDOM, ADRON, ISEM, and CLUPI) used to determine where to drill and acquire a sample.\nDuring the EC sampling phase, the “remote sensing” instruments are used less frequently, with the ALD instruments taking center stage. However, assuming the surface sample results are promising, on the sixth sol a 6-position WAC RRGB mosaic is acquired to help plan a WISDOM pattern search for a location to drill deeper for unaltered samples. The WAC is used again on the seventh sol to acquire 12 RRGB images to increase the accuracy of the knowledge of rover positioning at the corners of the WISDOM pattern.\nNext, on the eighth sol while drilling to at least 1.5 m depth is proceeding, the WAC is used to acquire a further 10 RRGB images for strategic planning (e.g., to help determine the drive direction for the following EC). The final use of PanCam during the sampling phase is on the 10th sol to image the retrieved subsurface sample with the HRC (along with CLUPI) before ingestion into the ALD.\nBetween the 11th and 13th sols, PanCam rests while the ALD instruments analyze the subsurface sample. Then, from the 14th to 18th sol, the rover drives to the next EC location, while conducting WISDOM and ADRON soundings. The only PanCam activity on these sols is the possible acquisition of WAC broadband red filter stereo pairs (or mosaics of stereo pairs) to provide higher-resolution views (than available with the NavCams) to help plan the rovers' course to the next EC location.\nDuring the mission's two vertical surveys, the PanCam is mostly inactive while the rover drills at a single location. HRC images of the samples prior to ingestion can again be envisaged.\n4.2. Instrument performance examples\nThe instrument performance will be determined from the integrated PanCam instrument and from calibration when the instrument has been assembled (see Section 5.1–5.2). At present, representative examples have been produced by using PanCam emulators such as the AUPE-2 Aberystwyth University PanCam Emulator 2 (e.g., Pugh et al., 2012 ; Harris et al., 2015 ) and breadboard models, but the actual instrument performance examples are not available as yet.\nA number of ExoMars-related field trials and tests have been performed in the last few years (see Fig. 12 ), including participation in recent Arctic Mars Analogue Svalbard Expeditions (AMASE) 2008–2015 (see Schmitz et al., 2009 ; Steele et al., 2010 ), the SAFER campaign in the Atacama Desert in 2013 (Gunes-Lasnet et al., 2014 ), and field trials in Iceland in 2013 (Harris et al., 2015 ). For these tests, a representative PanCam simulator was used, which was provided by Aberystwyth University. This simulator includes representative (though not the final) filter wavelengths from which spectral information may be used to study mineralogy. These campaigns have been used, in combination with teams from other ExoMars instruments, to develop working procedures representative of a mission to Mars, as well as to test instrument performance, develop calibration techniques, and pursue scientific investigations of particular areas. These included, for example, the Bockfjord Volcanic Complex and the Nordaustlandet/Palander Icecap. Scientific data from these trials are discussed elsewhere (Schmitz et al., unpublished data).\nView larger version                                     (74K)\nFIG. 12.\nViews of AUPE PanCam simulator at tests in a Hertfordshire, UK, quarry (bottom left) and at the AMASE campaign, Svalbard.\nInformation about Downloading\nOther PanCam ground tests have included “blind” geological identifications performed in the AU Mars analog facility, tests in a quarry in Hertfordshire with the Astrium UK “Bridget” prototype rover, a field trial in Shropshire in 2015, and deployment in Boulby mine (Payler et al., 2017 ).\n5. Calibration and 3-D Vision\n5.1. Radiometric calibration plan\nRaw PanCam images will be processed to remove image artifacts caused by the camera system and convert digital numbers into calibrated radiometric values. These processing activities will be implemented in the PanCam data processing pipeline at the ROCC. To correct camera-induced image artifacts and obtain a true representation of the scene viewed by PanCam, radiometric calibration measurements to fully characterize the camera properties will be necessary.\nThe radiometric calibration of the PanCam instrument will comprise a combination of component- and system-level measurements to characterize the properties of various parts of the instrument. Component-level calibrations will measure camera properties including the following: detector dark current and bias, detector linearity, detector hot/cold pixels, filter absolute transmission, PCT reflectance, and so on. System level calibrations will characterize properties of the complete system and include the following: flat-field measurements to determine the non-uniformity in the response of the optical system, measurements of system radiometric response, measurements of system spectral response and the response of the system to stray light. Dark current and flat fields will also be acquired periodically in flight to determine the effects of thermal cycling and radiation exposure on the detector response.\nMany of the camera properties will be temperature-dependent, so calibration will be carried out as a function of temperature. The PanCam instrument together with calibration hardware, including an integrating sphere, will be mounted in a thermal vacuum chamber (TVC) at MSSL (see Fig. 13b ) so that measurements can be carried out over the full operating temperature range of the system: −50°C to 35°C. These measurements will be interpolated to the sensor temperature recorded for the in-flight images to allow the modeled sensor response to be subtracted and estimates of remaining errors to be derived (following the methods of Bell et al., 2006).\nView larger version                                     (56K)\nFIG. 13.\n(a) PanCam embedded in the Geometric transformations chain of the ExoMars rover. The main element is the rover frame with various elements attached such as Drill or WISDOM (bottom). The cascade relevant for PanCam is the transform between rover and PTU, followed by the transform between PTU and WACL—depending on the pan-tilt values. WACL, HRC, and WACR are described in the PanCam coordinate system. In addition, for fusion purposes PanCam (WACL) will be cross-calibrated with NavCam and ISEM. (b) MSSL TVC to be used for WACs/HRC calibration in open state. (c) PanCam geometric calibration target design with random dot pattern for WACs (large dots) and HRC (small dots).\nInformation about Downloading\nThe integrating sphere will be mounted on a linear translation stage so that it can be placed in front of each of the PanCam cameras without breaking vacuum. Light sources for the integrating sphere will include white light for flat-field and linearity measurements and a tunable light source incorporating a monochromator for spectral calibrations. The light sources and a calibrated monitor spectrometer will be located outside the TVC and coupled via optical fibers. PanCam calibration measurements will be traceable to national standards laboratories (NIST) via appropriate calibration standards. These will include a calibrated light source to achieve absolute radiometric calibration and reflectance standards to determine the absolute reflectance of the PCT.\n5.2. Geometric calibration plan\nThe geometric calibration of the PanCam involves all the steps required to define its components in a common coordinate system. This coordinate system will allow local reconstruction of the information collected by the PanCam components at each rover position on Mars.\nTo perform calibration, first each PanCam camera must be calibrated individually, second relative to each other, and then to the rest of the PanCam components. This last step is called cross-calibration.\nThe individual calibration of the WACs and HRC will compute the coordinates of the principal point, the focal length, and the lens distortion coefficients for each camera that is called intrinsic orientation (IO)—various representations are available. PanCam will use a derivative of the TSAI model (Tsai, 1987 ) with the option to convert to other well-known schemes such as CAHVOR (Di and Li, 2004 ). The IO of the WACs will be obtained by using one representative filter (e.g., the red RGB component); distortion of other filters is measured in comparison to it by measuring the relative distortion. For HRC IO, the calibration using two different focal lengths is needed. The cross-calibration determines the geometric relationship between all PanCam components, which are mathematically expressed as 3-D-Helmert transformations, as displayed in Fig. 13a .\nChanges in the IOs of the WACs and HRC will be observed by executing several temperature transitions in vacuum. Further exhaustive tests will be conducted in ambient conditions outside the TVC to assess the dependency of the filter wavelengths on the WAC IOs and the stability of the WAC and HRC IO and relative orientation after rotating the cameras around the Pan and Tilt Unit (PTU).\nThe original plan to bring a full setup of 3-D target points, measured by an optical coordinate metrology system (e.g., Vicon), into the calibration clean room was abandoned due to planetary protection and laboratory space reasons. Instead, a flat calibration target that fulfils the planetary protection requirements, that is, appropriate for dry heat microbial reduction, will be used. It consists of an aluminum target containing a set of randomly distributed points in different scales to fit the WAC and HRC needs simultaneously, as displayed in Fig. 13c . Furthermore, in contrast to up-to-date approaches of targets with regular patterns (Bell et al., 2003; Edgett et al., 2015 ), the target can cover the full image, and the points can still be automatically detected and correctly assigned to perform a fully automatic calibration using hundreds of images.\nThe final AIT task requires measurements of the relative calibration between the rover and OB, PTU, FidMs, and Mast. The current plan is to accomplish this by cross-calibration with NavCam and additional adjustment of the WACs versus the PTU axes by multiple overlapping image observations under varying PTU angles and overlapping observations of the rover deck and fiducial markers under varying PTU angles.\nCross-calibration with ISEM and CLUPI will be obtained by multiple simultaneous viewing of the same target (e.g., the PCT), followed by an adjustment procedure. Cross-calibration to WISDOM will be done only indirectly based on the PanCam and WISDOM individual alignment in the rover coordinate system.\nVerification and possible correction of the calibration on Mars will be obtained by bundle adjustment of single stereo pairs and overlapping patches of stereo panoramas.\n5.3. 3-D vision\nThree-dimensional scene reconstruction from PanCam stereo imagery is established by the processing framework PRoViP (Planetary Robotics Vision Processing). Starting with images from the instrument available via the ESA Planetary Science Archive or NASA Planetary Data System (during the mission the data will be directly from downlink sources in the ROCC), stereo matching is performed, followed by 3-D reconstruction into DTMs in various geometries, generation of an intermediate data set (“GPC”: Generic Point Cloud), combination of the DTMs into unique consistent mosaicked products, and finally the export into products to be exploited by scientists and operations personnel.\nExamples of processing products and capabilities are as follows:\n(a) Digital Elevation Models in spherical, cylindrical, and Cartesian coordinate space;\n(b) Ortho images;\n(c) 3-D meshes;\n(d) Derived thematic maps of the surroundings, describing reconstruction accuracy, occlusions, solar illumination, slopes, roughness, hazards, and so on;\n(e) Fusion of rover- and orbiter-based images;\n(f) Fusion between WAC and HRC 3-D vision data products (e.g., overlay of WAC DTM/ortho images with HRC texture).\nPRoViP has been extensively tested with various Mars mission data sets from sensors similar to PanCam, including MSL Mastcam (Barnes et al., 2015a , Paar et al., 2016a , 2016b ) (see Fig. 14 ).\nView larger version                                     (55K)\nFIG. 14.\n(Left) Result of MSL Mastcam processing of Garden City outcrop area taken at MSL Sol 926 and 929 (DTM, rendered by PRo3D) making use of ExoMars PanCam 3-D vision processing workflow scheme PRoViP. (Right) 3-D rendered MSL Mastcam stereo processing results at subcentimeter resolution, as appearing in PRo3D Graphical User Interface.\nInformation about Downloading\nFor immersive 3-D presentation of the PanCam 3-D vision products, we will use an interactive 3-D viewing tool called “PRo3D” (Planetary Robotics 3D Viewer, Barnes et al., 2015b ), which allows one to virtually explore reconstructed martian terrain and perform geological analysis ( Fig. 15 ). PRo3D builds upon the ideas of existing rendering tools used for tactical and strategic planning such as combining the rover CAD model with the 3-D reconstructed environment (Poulakis et al., 2008 ; Cooper et al., 2013 ; Proton, 2015 ) or the exploitation of image poses to generate virtual views (Howard, 2015 ). In addition, it goes beyond the approach of transition between panoramas and 3-D environment followed in Google Mars but gives simultaneous real-time access to different resolutions from planetary to microscopic level and therefore allows an interactive fusion of rover image products and orbiter DTMs (Paar et al., 2015 ), closing the loop between 3-D vision processing and immersive 3-D geology. Various measurement and annotation tools are provided to\n(a) Delineate geological boundaries,\n(b) Obtain the true dimension of geological features,\n(c) Obtain linear and projected distances between surface points,\n(d) Calculate dip and strike values of stratigraphic layers.\nView larger version                                     (85K)\nFIG. 15.\nScreenshot of PRo3D showing a geological interpretation session in the Shaler area (Gale Crater, MSL mission), based on PRoViP 3-D reconstruction from a set of 99 MSL Mastcam stereo images. This detailed interpretation of the stratigraphy shows the main stratigraphic boundaries as gray lines, bedset boundaries as thick white lines, and laminations within those bedsets as thin white lines (note that the original image is in color). The dip and strike values are available directly in PRo3D in color coded by dip value and generally dip 15–20° to the southeast (validation forthcoming). The findings are consistent with those in the works of Anderson et al. ( 2015 ) and Edgar et al. ( 2014 ) in that the outcrop represents a changing fluvial environment, with recessive, fine-grained units interlayered with coarse, pebbly units.

Conclusions\nWe have described the scientific objectives of PanCam, its design, and how it will be used, as well as calibration methods and 3-D vision capabilities. PanCam has several powerful novel capabilities in terms of Mars camera deployment:\n• The WAC spacing, 50 cm, gives excellent stereo reconstruction\n• The WAC-HRC combination allows rock texture to be superimposed on the excellent DTMs\n• The WAC filters have been specifically designed to reduce uncertainty in the identification of water-rich minerals\n• WAC will perform atmospheric science measurements, that is, water vapor and dust determination, cloud monitoring\n• The HRC will provide rock texture information and will be able to view drill tailings, samples, and underneath the rover\n• PanCam will perform synergistic work with other context instruments (ISEM CLUPI, WISDOM, ADRON, and Ma_MISS)\nIn summary, PanCam will be a highly capable scientific camera system for the martian surface with an excellent anticipated scientific performance for geology, using filters selected for accurate identification of water-rich minerals and for atmospheric science and exobiology.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the ExoMars project team and Industry for their hard work on the ExoMars rover.

Because user interface specifications are typically embedded within complex systems requirements specifications, they can be intractable to manage. Proprietary requirements specification tools do not support the user interface designer in modelling and specifying the user interface. In this paper, a new way of working with embedded user interface specifications is proposed, exploiting sequence diagrams with a hypertext structure for representing and retrieving use cases. This new tool concept is assessed through an application to the requirements specification for the Airbus A380 air traffic control Datalink system; engineers involved in the development of the Airbus cockpit used a prototype of the tool concept to resolve a set of user interface design anomalies in the requirements specification.

Each agent has a non-increasing marginal valuation function for the resource, and an upper limit on the number of units that can be allocated in any period. We propose two versions on a truthful allocation mechanism. Each modifies the decisions of a greedy online assignment algorithm by sometimes cancelling an allocation of resources. One version makes this modification immediately upon an allocation decision while a second waits until the point at which an agent departs the market. Adopting a prior-free framework, we show that the second approach has better worst-case allocative efficiency and is more scalable. On the other hand, the first approach (with immediate cancellation) may be easier in practice because it does not need to reclaim units previously allocated. We consider an application to recharging plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Using data from a real-world trial of PHEVs in the UK, we demonstrate higher system performance than a fixed price system, performance comparable with a standard, but non-truthful scheduling heuristic, and the ability to support 50% more vehicles at the same fuel cost than a simple randomized policy.\n""","1.0","""http://jair.org/papers/paper4064.html""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

In other high risk domains in which the consequences of systems failure are unacceptable, organisational and operational work systems have been developed to deliver consistent, high-quality, failure-free performance. In this paper we review contributions to a special issue of Cognition, Technology and Work on ‘Enhancing Surgical Systems’. We consider their implications for improving the reliability of care processes in light of theoretical developments in the area of high-reliability organisations and resilience engineering. Health care must move from reactive safety cultures to be more proactively resilient to the continual threats posed by complexity in clinical care processes and the multi-professional hospital environment. Our analysis emphasises the importance of team working for reliable operational performance. A schematic framework to illustrate how safety interventions in surgery might cohere within an organisational strategy for achieving high-reliability is proposed. The implications for continuous quality improvement and effective regulation of system safety over differing time scales and organisational levels are discussed.\nKeywords\nHigh-reliability organisations Reliability Health care systems Continuous quality improvement Safety management Surgery Teams Resilience engineering \nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access\nNotes\nAcknowledgments\nThe Health Foundation, 90 Long Acre, London WC2E 9RA, http://www.health.org.uk/ .

Walking speed, start-up delay measures (average & variability), and spatial planning explained 54.8% of the variance in far-side unsafe crossing errors. Start-up delay was predicted by walking speed only (explained 30.5%).\nConclusion: Walking speed and start-up delay measures were consistent predictors of unsafe crossing behaviours. Cognitive measures, however, differentially predicted near-side errors (processing speed), and far-side errors (spatial planning). These findings offer potential contributions for identifying and rehabilitating at-risk older pedestrians.\nDocuments\nRights statement: © 2016, Elsevier.

Masonry bridges are complex heterogeneous systems, where masonry arches represent the main components. Thus, a realistic modelling of arches is vital for accurate assessment of masonry bridges. The authors have previously proposed and validated a detailed mesoscale description for masonry arches allowing for the actual masonry bond and the specific arch geometry including the case of skew arches. In this paper, the proposed mesoscale modelling strategy is used in a comprehensive numerical study to investigate the effects of various parameters, including masonry bond and defects in the brickwork, abutment stiffness and movements at the supports, which are usually disregarded in practical assessment of masonry arches and bridges. The results achieved show how these parameters affect the ultimate load capacity, failure mechanisms and initial stiffness of square and skew arches, where the use of detailed 3D mesoscale modelling is critical in providing accurate response predictions under a variety of loading conditions for which reduced models might provide incorrect results.\n""","0.531508","""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15732479.2017.1324883""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

Existing work on such mechanisms has typically assumed that participants are fully rational and can report their preferences accurately via some interface to the mechanism or to a software agent participating on their behalf. However, this may not be reasonable in settings with non-expert human end-users.Thus, our overarching aim in this paper is to determine experimentally if a fully expressive market interface that enables accurate preference reports is suitable for the EV charging domain, or, alternatively, if a simpler, restricted interface that reduces the space of possible options is preferable. In doing this, we measure the performance of an interface both in terms of how it helps participants maximise their utility and how it affects deliberation time. Our secondary objective is to contrast two different types of restricted interfaces that vary in how they restrict the space of preferences that can be reported. To enable this analysis, we develop a novel game that replicates key features of an abstract EV charging scenario. In two experiments with over 300 users, we show that restricting the users' preferences significantly reduces the time they spend deliberating (by up to half in some cases). An extensive usability survey confirms that this restriction is furthermore associated with a lower perceived cognitive burden on the users. More surprisingly, at the same time, using restricted interfaces leads to an increase in the users' performance compared to the fully expressive interface (by up to 70%). We also show that some restricted interfaces have the desirable effect of reducing the energy consumption of their users by up to 20% while achieving the same utility as other interfaces. Finally, we find that a reinforcement learning agent displays similar performance trends to human users, enabling a novel methodology for evaluating market interfaces.\n""","1.0","""http://jair.org/papers/paper5387.html""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

To coordinate the regenerative brake and friction brake, improving regeneration efficiency and guaranteeing brake performance and brake safety, development of special brake systems for electrified vehicles is needed.This paper presents a new type of electrically-controlled regenerative braking system (EABS) that has been developed for electrified passenger vehicles, which has the potential to be brought into production in China. By utilizing as much as possible mature components, integrating cooperative regeneration with ABS/TCS functions, EABS can achieve high regeneration efficiency and brake safety while providing system reliability, low development cost and development risk. This article describes the layout of the newly developed regenerative braking system. The operation modes and control methods of the system are introduced. Road test data from a commercialized electric vehicle prove the good performance of this system. The energy consumption of vehicle reduced by EABS developed is over 25% under ECE driving cycle.\nEvent:\n""","0.48886967","""http://papers.sae.org/2013-01-1463/""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

Moreover, the European Network on Noise and Health (ENNAH), which helped to establish collaboration between researchers on noise and researchers on air quality, identified gaps in the evidence of environmental noise related health research and concluded that one of the most important topics to focus on was noise and co-exposures. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to summarize current knowledge on the association between environmental noise and air pollutant exposure and cardiovascular health effects, and to look at whether the evidence suggests that noise and air pollution confound or interact with each other. This review comprises a literature search for the period 2005 to 2012. It also aims to identify gaps which could help to shape future research directions.

The primary composite end point was death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or transient ischemic attack. Secondary end points included other cardiovascular outcomes, health-related quality of life, snoring symptoms, daytime sleepiness, and mood.\nResults\nMost of the participants were men who had moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and minimal sleepiness. In the CPAP group, the mean duration of adherence to CPAP therapy was 3.3 hours per night, and the mean apnea–hypopnea index (the number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour of recording) decreased from 29.0 events per hour at baseline to 3.7 events per hour during follow-up. After a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, a primary end-point event had occurred in 229 participants in the CPAP group (17.0%) and in 207 participants in the usual-care group (15.4%) (hazard ratio with CPAP, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.32; P=0.34). No significant effect on any individual or other composite cardiovascular end point was observed. CPAP significantly reduced snoring and daytime sleepiness and improved health-related quality of life and mood.\nConclusions\nTherapy with CPAP plus usual care, as compared with usual care alone, did not prevent cardiovascular events in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and established cardiovascular disease.

We describe the main results of the Sleep Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints (SAVE) study, a secondary prevention trial that was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of CPAP in reducing the rate of cardiovascular events among patients with obstructive sleep apnea. 24\nMethods\nStudy Design and Oversight\nThe SAVE study was an international, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, open-label trial, with blinded end-point assessment. Details of the design and analysis plan of the trial have been published previously. 24,25 An executive committee (see the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) designed the study and supervised the conduct of the trial and the collection of the data. The Adelaide Institute for Sleep Health of Flinders University of South Australia was responsible for the overall management of the trial and provided the core sleep laboratory analysis and monitoring of the CPAP data and treatment at the sites. Investigators at the George Institute for Global Health coordinated the trial, managed the database, and performed the statistical analyses. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol , available at NEJM.org. An independent data and safety monitoring board monitored unblinded trial results and safety events. The trial protocol was approved by all appropriate regulatory authorities and ethics committees at the participating centers. All participants provided written informed consent.\nThe National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia and Philips Respironics provided the main funding for the trial. In-kind donations were provided by Respironics for the CPAP equipment and by ResMed for the sleep apnea diagnostic devices. None of the funding agencies contributed to the design of the trial, the collection or analysis of the data, the writing of the manuscript, or the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.\nPatients and Procedures\nPatients were recruited at 89 clinical centers in 7 countries; eligibility criteria included an age between 45 and 75 years, a diagnosis of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular disease, and a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea. The diagnosis of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea, which was defined as an oxygen desaturation index (the number of times per hour during the oximetry recording that the blood oxygen saturation level drops by ≥4 percentage points from baseline) of at least 12, was established with the use of a home sleep-study screening device (ApneaLink, ResMed) and was confirmed by review of the data at a central core sleep laboratory. Patients were excluded from the study if they reported severe daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score >15; scores range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating greater severity) or were considered to have an increased risk of an accident from falling asleep, if they had very severe hypoxemia (oxygen saturation <80% for >10% of recording time), or if they had a pattern of Cheyne–Stokes respiration on the ApneaLink nasal pressure recording.\nPotential participants were required to have a minimum level of adherence to CPAP therapy, which was defined as an average of 3 hours per night, during a 1-week run-in period in which sham CPAP was used (i.e., CPAP at subtherapeutic pressure). Further details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria and of the procedures performed at the core sleep laboratory are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\nRandomization and Interventions\nAfter eligibility was confirmed, the patients were randomly assigned, at a central location, to receive either CPAP therapy plus usual care (CPAP group) or usual care alone (usual-care group). Randomization was performed with the use of a minimization procedure to balance the group assignments according to site, type of cardiovascular disease (cardiac, cerebrovascular, or both), and severity of daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score <11 vs. ≥11).\nThe patients who were assigned to receive mask-delivered CPAP treatment were provided with an automated positive airway pressure machine (REMstar Auto, M or PR series, Philips Respironics) that was initially set in automatic mode for 1 week and thereafter fixed to the 90th percentile of pressure that was calculated by the automated positive airway pressure device from the recorded data. The core sleep laboratory monitored trends in adherence to CPAP therapy and provided corrective advice to investigators (further details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix ). Concomitant management of cardiovascular risk factors was performed in accordance with national guidelines. All participants were given advice on healthful sleep habits and lifestyle changes to minimize obstructive sleep apnea. Clinic visits were scheduled for all participants at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and annually thereafter; the participants were contacted by telephone at 6 months between annual clinic visits.\nStudy Measurements\nAt randomization and at each follow-up visit, participants had resting blood pressure and heart rate measured at the clinic, and details of current medication use and health behaviors were documented through a structured interview. Among the participants in the CPAP group, data on adherence to the use of the CPAP device were recorded. At randomization, at 6 months, and at 2 and 4 years, anthropometric measurements were obtained in all participants, and all participants completed several questionnaires: questionnaires that assessed symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (snoring, witnessed episodes of apnea, and degree of sleepiness according to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score), the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36; scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life) for assessment of health-related quality of life, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (on which anxiety and depression scores range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating more symptoms) for assessment of mood. Electrocardiography was performed in all participants at the time of randomization and at 2 years. The European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D; scores range from 1 to 3, with higher scores indicating more problems across five categories of quality of life) was administered only at the end-of-study visit.\nThe end-of-study visits were conducted from September 2015 through January 2016 (except in India, where they were conducted from July through October 2013). In addition to performing a regular central review of data quality, research staff visited the participating sites to monitor and verify the completeness and authenticity of source documents and adverse-event reporting. Additional details on study measurements and monitoring procedures are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\nStudy End Points\nA committee whose members were unaware of the study-group assignments adjudicated the major cardiovascular outcomes specified in the protocol. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cardiovascular cause, myocardial infarction (including silent myocardial infarction), stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure, acute coronary syndrome (including unstable angina), or transient ischemic attack. Prespecified secondary cardiovascular end points included the individual components of the primary composite end point, other composites of cardiovascular events, revascularization procedures, new-onset atrial fibrillation, new-onset diabetes mellitus, and death from any cause. Other secondary end points included symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea, health-related quality of life, and mood.\nPrespecified safety end points were assessed each time the participant was contacted; these end points included all serious adverse events, self-reported accidents causing personal injury that occurred while the participant was driving or while at work, and any accidents or near-miss accidents that occurred as a result of the participant falling asleep. Two safety end points that were not prespecified — the number of self-reported road-traffic accidents from any cause and the number of days off from work because of poor health — were also assessed. Descriptions of the study end points and of the procedures used by the data and safety monitoring board and end-point adjudicators are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\nStatistical Analysis\nOur original plan was to recruit 5000 patients. In 2012, challenges in achieving recruitment targets prompted us to review the accumulated blinded study data and an updated meta-regression of studies of cardiovascular events and severity of obstructive sleep apnea. The meta-regression showed that cardiovascular risk increased by 25 to 32% for every increase of 10 events per hour in the apnea–hypopnea index (the number of occurrences of apnea or hypopnea per hour of sleep), which was a stronger relationship than we had originally assumed. 24 In consideration of this information, together with interim blinded trial data showing an annual event rate of 6.86% and better-than-expected adherence to CPAP therapy, we revised our sample size to 2500 patients; we estimated that with this sample size, the study would have 90% statistical power (at an alpha level of 0.05) to detect a 25% lower incidence with CPAP plus usual care than with usual care alone of the primary composite cardiovascular end point, which was anticipated to occur in 533 patients overall over a mean follow-up of 4.5 years.\nThe primary analysis was an unadjusted survival analysis performed according to the intention-to-treat principle with the use of Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling that was based on positively adjudicated events. We performed a series of sensitivity analyses, including an analysis with adjustment for stratification variables, region, and severity of obstructive sleep apnea; an analysis with Poisson regression to account for participants with multiple events; and an analysis that included all events that were reported by the investigators and not just those that were positively adjudicated. To estimate the effect in patients who were adherent to CPAP therapy, which was defined as an average of 4 hours or more of treatment per night over the first 2 years, we used prespecified propensity-score matching to match adherent patients one-to-one with participants selected from the usual-care (control) group who never used CPAP. The change in clinical variables from baseline to 48 months or to the end-of-study visit (whichever came first) was assessed with the use of analysis of covariance with adjustment for baseline values. All P values are two-sided and were not adjusted for multiple testing. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute). (Additional details regarding the sample-size calculations and other aspects of the statistical analysis are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .)\nResults\nTable 3. Other Outcomes.Table 4.\nTable 4. Serious Adverse Events and Other Conditions of Interest.\nThe reductions from baseline in sleepiness and other symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea were greater in the CPAP group than in the usual-care group (estimated mean between-group difference in the change from baseline in Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, −2.5; 95% CI, −2.8 to −2.2; P<0.001) ( Table 3 ). Greater reductions from baseline in the anxiety and depression subscale scores of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were also observed in the CPAP group than in the usual-care group ( Table 3 ), and the percentage of patients with clinically relevant depression scores was 25 to 30% lower in the CPAP group than in the usual-care group at the end of follow-up. The CPAP group had greater improvement in scores on the physical and mental subscales of the SF-36 than the usual-care group ( Table 3 ), as well as fewer days off from work because of poor health (a nonprespecified end point) than the usual-care group ( Table 4 ). The number of serious adverse events and the rate of road-traffic accidents and accidents causing injury did not differ significantly between the two groups ( Table 4 ). (Further details on the results for the secondary and other end points are provided in Figs. S4 and S5 and Tables S8 and S12 through S16 in the Supplementary Appendix .)\nDiscussion\nThis secondary prevention trial in adults with cardiovascular disease and obstructive sleep apnea showed that the risk of serious cardiovascular events was not lower among patients who received treatment with CPAP in addition to usual care than among those who received usual care alone. Treatment with CPAP was associated with a greater reduction in symptoms of daytime sleepiness and with improved health-related quality of life, mood, and attendance at work. This study was not powered to provide definitive answers regarding the effects of CPAP on secondary cardiovascular end points, but there was no indication of a significant benefit with respect to any cause-specific cardiovascular outcome.\nThree other randomized trials have investigated the effect of CPAP on cardiovascular end points in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. 26-28 Two studies — a multicenter study conducted in Spain that compared CPAP with usual care in 725 patients with obstructive sleep apnea who did not have prior cardiovascular disease 26 and a single-center study involving 224 patients with obstructive sleep apnea and coronary artery disease who had just undergone revascularization 28 — showed no difference in composite cardiovascular end points over several years of follow-up, although in adjusted analyses, both studies reported better outcomes among patients who were adherent to CPAP therapy (≥4 hours per night) than among patients who did not receive CPAP or who used CPAP less than 4 hours per night. The third study involving 140 patients with recent ischemic stroke showed no effect of CPAP on event-free survival over 2 years. 27\nOne important potential limitation of our trial is that, for several of the participating countries, the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea were not well established in clinical practice when the trial began. However, before trial recruitment, we expended substantial time and effort in conducting training workshops for investigators and study coordinators. In addition, extensive site monitoring was conducted throughout the trial to ensure a high standard of study conduct.\nParticipants in the SAVE study who were assigned to CPAP adhered to the treatment for a mean of 3.3 hours per night over several years, which is similar to the mean adherence in other reports of CPAP use in patients who had no or minimal daytime sleepiness 29,30 and which is consistent with CPAP use in clinical practice. 31 However, although this overall level of adherence to CPAP therapy exceeded the estimates in our power calculations, it may still have been insufficient to provide the level of effect on cardiovascular outcomes that had been hypothesized. For practical reasons and to ensure efficient recruitment and consistency of data across multiple sites, we used a simple screening device (ApneaLink) that was based on oximetry and nasal pressure recordings and used automated algorithms to analyze signals, rather than the conventional standard test for obstructive sleep apnea in which polysomnographic data from an overnight stay in a hospital or clinic are scored manually. The ApneaLink screening device has been shown to be a reliable method for diagnosing moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea. 32,33 To mitigate the risk of recruiting patients with predominantly central apnea rather than obstructive sleep apnea, we excluded patients with overt heart failure and patients in whom the nasal pressure signals showed a predominant pattern of Cheyne–Stokes respiration.\nIn conclusion, in a large group of adults with both cardiovascular disease and moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea, the use of CPAP therapy had no significant effect on the prevention of recurrent serious cardiovascular events, despite significantly reduced sleepiness and other symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea and improved quality-of-life measures.\nFunding and Disclosures\nPresented at the European Society of Cardiology Conference, Rome, August 28, 2016.\nSupported by project grants (1006501 [2011–2015] and 1060078 [2014–2016]) from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia and by Respironics Sleep and Respiratory Research Foundation and Philips Respironics.

Although the evidence is increasing, heterogeneity in size of effect estimates between cohort studies has been identified ( Hoek et al. 2013 ).\nCohort studies specifically designed for investigating individual risk factors are time consuming, labor intensive, often limited in size, and relatively costly. To overcome these disadvantages, recent studies have linked existing national databases of air pollution, nonaccidental mortality, individual characteristics, and residential history to assess the relationships between air pollution and mortality more efficiently ( Carey et al. 2013 ; Cesaroni et al. 2013 ; Chen et al. 2013 ; Crouse et al. 2012 ; Hales et al. 2012 ; Huss et al. 2010 ; Zeger et al. 2008 ). The aim of our study was to use existing national databases to evaluate the associations of long term exposure to air pollution [particulates with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)] with nonaccidental and cause-specific mortality in a cohort of 7.1 million Dutch residents.\nMethods\nThe study cohort. In the Netherlands, population statistics are compiled by Statistics Netherlands ( http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/home/defaul​t.htm ) and are based on digital municipal population registers ( Prins 2000 ). This registration system is known as the GBA (Gemeentelijke Basis Administratie), the municipal basic registration of population data. The GBA was implemented on 1 October 1994.\nStatistics Netherlands combines the data from the GBA into a longitudinal file for each individual registered in the GBA ( de Bruin et al. 2004 ). These records start on 1 January 1995. Changes in demographic attributes (e.g., death, address, marital status, emigration) are updated yearly by adding additional information on the nature and the date of the change. In these files, the individual identification number of the GBA is replaced by a meaningless, but unique, identification number. This identification number is used to enrich the individual files with information from other central data sources maintained by Statistics Netherlands such as the social statistical database, which contains, among others, data from the tax authorities and about employment status ( Arts and Hoogteijling 2002 ).\nFrom the database with the longitudinal files of all Dutch inhabitants, we selected all individuals of ≥ 30 years of age on 1 January 2004, living at the same residential address since 1 January 1999. We used data about sex, age, marital status, and region of origin. The data about origin distinguishes between Dutch, Western origin, and non-Western origin. Individuals of non-Western origin are those born in or with a parent born in Africa, Asia (except Japan and Indonesia, who are categorized as “Western origin”), or Latin America. Given the relatively large size of groups within non-Western origin, a distinction is made among those with Turkey, Morocco, and Suriname origin. Furthermore, we enriched the database with standardized disposable household income. This individual socioeconomic indicator is adjusted for differences in household size and composition.\nWe also used a socioeconomic indicator at four-digit postal code level. These postal code areas comprise on average about 4,000 inhabitants. This social status indicator is derived every 4 years by the Netherlands Institute for Social Research ( http://www.scp.nl/english/ ) ( Knol 1998 ). Each postal code area receives a unique ranking for social status according to the income level, unemployment rate, and education level of its inhabitants. The ranking is transformed to a 0–1 scale, with 1 being the lowest possible ranking on social status within the Netherlands. We took the indicator from 2002 and linked it to the cohort through the postal code of the residential addresses.\nThe follow-up period of the cohort was from 1 January 2004 to 1 January 2011. Subjects were lost to follow-up if their final record in the longitudinal file ended before 1 January 2011 and death was not registered as a reason for termination. Emigration was the main cause of censoring.\nThe Dutch population registers are intended primarily for municipal administrative purposes. However, many national and nongovernmental organizations benefit from them as well. Given the confidential character of the data, there is no free access to the population registers. Each organization interested in receiving data on a regular basis is given the opportunity to use the data upon request to the Ministry for the Interior. The Ministry decides to which data the organization gets access.\nAll our analyses were performed within strict privacy rules; that is, only researchers who received a signed permit were allowed to do analyses within a secured environment at our Institute. Before publication, Statistics Netherlands made sure that none of the analysis results showed potential reducibility to the individual level.\nMortality outcomes. A database with mortality data was available from Statistics Netherlands ( Harteloh et al. 2010 ). We selected nonaccidental mortality [International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes A00-R99], circulatory disease mortality (ICD-10 codes I00-I99), respiratory disease mortality (ICD-10 codes J00-J99), and lung cancer mortality (ICD-10 codes C33–C34). A study of cause-of-death coding showed high reliability for these specific causes (> 90% for major causes of death such as cancers and acute myocardial infarction and about 85% for respiratory disease mortality) ( Harteloh et al. 2010 ).\nAir pollution exposure assessment. We made use of previously published land use regression (LUR) models to produce high-resolution air pollution maps (100 m × 100 m grids) of annual mean concentrations of PM10 and NO2 in 2001. Details of development and validation of the LUR models are presented elsewhere ( Vienneau et al. 2010 ). Briefly, for both pollutants regression models were derived from annual mean concentrations for the year 2001 based on routine measurement data from the Dutch National Air Quality Monitoring Network ( van Elzakker and Buijsman 2014 ). Predictor variables used for the modeling were traffic, land use, and topography integrated in a geographical information system. Addresses at baseline were linked to the estimated PM10 and NO2 concentration in the corresponding grid.\nWe did not assign PM2.5 (PM with diameter ≤ 2.5 μm) concentrations to cohort addresses, because in 2001 PM2.5 was not measured in the national monitoring network. Two monitoring studies ( Cyrys et al. 2003 ; Eeftens et al. 2012 ) showed that the spatial variation of PM10 in the Netherlands is largely driven by PM2.5 (R2 = 0.76 and 0.72) with a median ratio between PM2.5 and PM10 of 0.66 that was stable over time from 2000 to 2009.\nStatistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). We applied age-stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate the associations [hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI)] between (cause-specific) mortality and long-term exposure to PM10 or NO2. We used 1-year age strata. We analyzed the data with a) models adjusting for age and sex (“unadjusted” model); b) models adjusted for age, sex, marital status, region of origin, and household income (individual confounder model); c) the individual confounder models extended with a socioeconomic status indicator of postal code areas (full model). In addition, we d) extended the full model with the second pollutant to analyze the robustness of the one-pollutant estimate when adjusted for the second pollutant. Statistical significance was defined as p-values < 0.05.\nWe explored nonlinearity in the relationships between PM10 and NO2 exposure and mortality with natural splines (2 degrees of freedom). We used the likelihood ratio test (LRT) (p < 0.05) to compare spline models with linear models. We analyzed these models with R version 2.15.1 ( R Core Team 2014 ).\nTo assess the sensitivity of our relative risk estimates to missing individual lifestyle factor data, we assessed the association between our air pollution exposure estimates and lifestyle factors in a separate survey of adults across the Netherlands. We obtained data from health surveys from Community Health Services ( GGD GHOR Nederland 2014 ) conducted in 2003–2005. We included data from 11 Community Health Services with available information on self-reported four-digit postal code, age, sex, marital status, level of education, region of origin, smoking, body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, and exercise. Criteria for alcohol consumption were defined by a national working group of experts for the purpose of the Community Health Services health surveys. We calculated the age- and sex-adjusted mean PM10 and NO2 concentrations at four-digit postal code level for different categories of smoking (current smoker, former smoker, never smoker), BMI (< 18.5, 18.5–25, 25–30, > 30), alcohol consumption (different categories of compliance to three criteria for responsible alcohol use), and exercise (compliance to 30 min of moderate exercise per day on at least 5 days per week). Subsequently, we additionally adjusted for the individual and neighborhood confounders that were also included in the Cox proportional hazard regression models [i.e., marital status, region of origin, individual socioeconomic status (using level of education in place of standardized household income, which was not available), and social status]. In addition to these regression analyses, we calculated the prevalence of the different variables under study for different categories (deciles) of PM10 and NO2 exposure.\nFurthermore, in the full population we additionally adjusted for area-level smoking-related mortality estimated based upon observed lung cancer rates ( Janssen and Spriensma 2012 ).\nIn addition we assessed effect modification by stratifying our analyses by sex, age (30–65 or > 65 years), socioeconomic status (five categories), and degree of urbanization (five categories). Results are graphically presented.\nResults\nOn 1 January 2004 the total population of the Netherlands was 16,260,465, of whom 9,936,994 had not moved residence in the previous 5 years (61%). Of these, 7,218,363 were of ≥ 30 years of age (73%) and entered the cohort. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the cohort members on 1 January 2004. During the follow-up period until 1 January 2011, 668,206 (9.3%) cohort members died from natural causes. Of these, 209,940 (31.4%) died from diseases of the circulatory system, 65,132 (9.7%) died from diseases of the respiratory system, and 53,735 (8.0%) died from lung cancer ( Table 1 ).\nTable 1 – Characteristics of the cohort (n = 7,218,363) at baseline (2004).\nView larger image (TIF File)\nThe correlation (R) between PM10 and NO2 was 0.58.\nThe results of the Cox proportional hazard analyses are presented in Tables 2 (PM10) and 3 (NO2). The highest HRs were found for both pollutants and for each category of cause of death for the “unadjusted” model. Adding individual confounders and area level for socioeconomic status reduced the magnitude of the associations.\nTable 2 – Hazard ratios (95% CIs) per 10-μg/m3 increase in PM10 levels at the home address in 2001 for nonaccidental mortality, mortality from circulatory diseases, mortality from respiratory diseases, and lung cancer mortality.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nWe estimated the following associations for a 10-μg/m3 increase in exposure to PM10 and NO2, respectively, based on the full models: for nonaccidental mortality, HR = 1.08 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.09) and HR = 1.03 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.03); for mortality from respiratory diseases, HR = 1.13 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.17) and HR = 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.03); and for lung cancer mortality, HR = 1.26 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.30) and HR = 1.10 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.11). Only PM10 was associated with circulatory disease mortality (HR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.08 compared with HR = 1.00; 95%: 0.99, 1.01 for NO2). For both pollutants, associations were strongest for lung cancer mortality (PM10 HR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.21, 1.30; NO2 HR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.11).\nIn the two-pollutant models, HRs for PM10 decreased for nonaccidental mortality and lung cancer mortality, and increased for circulatory or respiratory disease mortality, still remaining statistically significant ( Table 2 ). All HRs for NO2 decreased after adjustment for PM10, and the association with respiratory diseases was negative and no longer significant ( Table 3 ).\nTable 3 – Hazard ratios (95% CIs) per 10-μg/m3 increase in NO2 levels at the home address in 2001 for nonaccidental mortality, mortality from circulatory diseases, mortality from respiratory diseases, and lung cancer mortality.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nTo compare results with previous cohort studies, we calculated HRs for PM2.5 assuming that the association with PM10 is driven by the PM2.5 fraction ( Beelen et al. 2014 ; Hoek et al. 2013 ). Based on a PM2.5/PM10 ratio of 0.66 ( Cyrys et al. 2003 ; Eeftens et al. 2012 ) and PM10 HRs from the fully adjusted model, we estimated the following for each 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5: for nonaccidental mortality, HR = 1.13 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.14), for circulatory disease mortality HR = 1.09 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.12), for respiratory disease mortality HR = 1.18 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.27), and for lung cancer mortality HR = 1.41 (95% CI: 1.34, 1.49).\nAssociations between PM10 and nonaccidental, circulatory disease and lung cancer mortality did not deviate significantly (p < 0.01) from linear ( Figure 2 ). The association with respiratory disease mortality increased up to about 40 μg/m3 and then unexpectedly decreased. Associations between NO2 and mortality deviated significantly from linear only for circulatory disease ( Figure 2 ).\nFigure 2 – Estimated concentration–response curves (solid blue lines) and 95% CIs (dashed lines) for nonaccidental mortality, circulatory disease mortality, respiratory disease mortality, and lung cancer mortality for (A) NO2 and (B) PM10. ln, natural logarithm. Model was adjusted for age, sex, marital status, region of origin, and household income.\nView larger image (TIF File)\nIn addition to our main analysis, we conducted a separate analysis of associations of PM10 and NO2 with potential individual- and group-level confounders that were not available for the nationwide study sample, because the presence or absence of associations would help clarify the likelihood of confounding by these characteristics. After excluding data from adults < 30 years of age, information on lifestyle factors from 63,796 subjects was available, from 1,517 of the 3,985 four-digit postal code areas across the Netherlands. Age- and sex-adjusted mean PM10 and NO2 for different categories of selected sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle factors are presented in the Supplemental Material, Tables S1 and S2, respectively. PM10 concentrations differed statistically significantly between the various categories, although these differences were small (< 0.2 μg/m3). After additional adjustment for marital status, region of origin, level of education, and neighborhood social status, these differences decreased to 0.07 μg/m3 for smoking and 0.10 μg/m3 for BMI, and 95% CIs overlapped (see Supplemental Material, Table S3). For NO2, these differences in age- and sex-adjusted mean concentrations were somewhat larger: 0.64 μg/m3 for current smokers compared with never smokers and 0.80 for BMI > 30 compared with 18.5 < BMI < 25. After additional adjustment for marital status, region of origin, level of education, and neighborhood social status, these differences decreased to 0.46 μg/m3 both for smoking and for BMI, but remained statistically significant (see Supplemental Material, Table S3). When we evaluated differences in prevalence of lifestyle and sociodemographic characteristics across different categories (deciles) of PM10 and NO2 exposure, the percentage of current smokers and participants with BMI > 30 are highest in the highest two deciles of PM10 and NO2 exposure. However, the percentage of non-Dutch nationality, low education, and average neighborhood social status score follow a similar pattern, except for non-Dutch nationality in the highest decile of PM10 (see Supplemental Material, Table S4).\nAdditional adjustment for smoking-attributable mortality reduced the HR for PM10 by about 30% for non-accidental mortality (from 1.081 to 1.058) to 40% for the cause-specific mortalities (see Supplemental Material, Table S5). The HRs for NO2 changed marginally for nonaccidental mortality (from 1.027 to 1.022), for deaths from diseases of the circulatory system (nonsignificant), and for lung cancer mortality (from 1.097 to 1.083). The NO2 HR for respiratory mortality changed from 1.015 to a nonsignificant 1.003.\nIn Figure 3 we present the HRs for nonaccidental, circulatory, respiratory, and lung cancer mortality per 10 μg/m3 PM10 and NO2 by sex, age, social economic status and degree of urbanization. We did not find consistent patterns of effect modification across the different outcomes, although, except for circulatory mortality, HRs tended to be closer to unity among those > 65 years of age compared with younger residents. For lung cancer, women were at higher risks for both, PM10 and NO2 exposure.\nFigure 3 – Adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) per 10-μg/m3 increase in PM10 (A) and NO2 (B), by population characteristics and cause of death. Model was adjusted for age, sex, marital status, region of origin, socioeconomic status, and household income, stratified as indicated on x-axis. Socioeconomic status categories are based on the quintiles of the social status rankings; urbanization is based on address density: (low: < 500 addresses/km2; moderate low: 500–1,000 addresses/km2; medium: 1,000–1,500 addresses/km2; moderate high: 1,500–2,500 addresses/km2; high: > 2,500 addresses/km2).\nView larger image (TIF File)\nDiscussion\nIn this large Dutch nationwide population cohort of > 7 million adults we observed positive significant associations between estimated long-term exposure to air pollution (PM10 and NO2) at the home address and nonaccidental, circulatory disease, respiratory disease, and lung cancer mortality. We used large national demographic and geographical databases to assess these associations. Our results suggest that PM10 is more consistently associated with mortality than NO2.\nThe large size of the cohort allowed us to assess the small relative risks of ambient air pollution with more precision than in typical individual cohort studies. Interestingly, we found highly significant associations between PM10 and respiratory mortality. Associations between long-term exposure to fine particles and respiratory mortality have been inconsistent in previous individual cohort studies, partly due to a relatively small number of cases ( Hoek et al. 2013 ). Our findings are in agreement with time-series studies based on registries that have shown consistent associations between day-to-day variation in air pollution and respiratory mortality. Consistent with the time-series studies, our estimates for respiratory mortality are larger than for nonaccidental mortality.\nAnother interesting finding is that although circulatory disease mortality was significantly associated with PM10, hazard ratios were smaller than for nonaccidental mortality. Overall, in previous cohort studies, hazard ratios were larger for circulatory disease mortality, though with considerable variation between studies ( Hoek et al. 2013 ). We speculate that better medication has reduced cardiovascular mortality, complicating assessment of associations with risk factors including air pollution.\nRecently, several studies were published that were based on national demographic databases linked to air pollution data ( Carey et al. 2013 ; Cesaroni et al. 2013 ; Chen et al. 2013 ; Crouse et al. 2012 ; Hales et al. 2012 ; Huss et al. 2010 ; Zeger et al. 2008 ). Three systematic reviews on the health effects of long-term exposure to air pollution ( Brook et al. 2010 ; Chen et al. 2008 ; Hoek et al. 2013 ) give an extensive overview of the published literature on mortality and long-term exposure to air pollution. In Supplemental Material, Table S6, we summarize the results of the national registry studies and recent papers on mortality outcomes from a large European study on air pollution and health. For comparisons, we added our results into the table.\nIn our study we found particulate matter to be associated with all outcome measures that we have analyzed. Our relative risk estimate for PM10 on total mortality is higher than the relative risk estimate from a recent published study based on 19 European cohorts ( Beelen et al. 2014 ). Only two other registry-based studies assessed the associations between mortality and PM10 ( Carey et al. 2013 ; Hales et al. 2012 ). Both studies, like ours, reported higher HRs for respiratory mortality than for cardiovascular mortality (although the Hales study included lungcancer mortality). A Dutch study by Beelen et al. (2008) also estimated higher HRs for respiratory mortality than for cardiovascular mortality (for PM2.5), and Cesaroni et al. (2013) in Rome, Italy, reported higher HR for PM2.5 for cardiovascular mortality than for respiratory mortality. For NO2 we found statistically significant associations with all outcomes except for circulatory disease mortality, which is in line with earlier Dutch cohort study results ( Beelen et al. 2008 ) in which a nonsignificant association for NO2 was reported. Again, our estimate on total mortality is higher than the relative risk estimate from the recent published European study ( Beelen et al. 2014 ). Our results for nonaccidental mortality are comparable with the results from the registry studies by Carey et al. (2013) and Cesaroni et al. (2013) and the Dutch cohort study by Beelen et al. (2008) . Cause-specific results show more heterogeneity between the different studies presented in Supplemental Material, Table S6. In the analyses in which we adjusted associations with NO2 for PM10 concentrations, the association between NO2 and respiratory mortality disappeared while the PM10 effects remained. This suggests that mortality effects of particles are not explained exclusively by traffic, as was suggested in a recent European study as well ( Beelen et al. 2014 ).\nOur estimates for lung cancer mortality for PM10 and NO2 are higher than those published recently in the national cohorts ( Carey et al. 2013 ; Cesaroni et al. 2013 ; Hales et al. 2012 ; Huss et al. 2010 ), but comparable with the PM10 estimate for lung cancer incidence in a recently published study on the relation between long term exposure to air pollution and lung cancer incidence in 14 European cohorts ( Raaschou-Nielsen et al. 2013 ). Adjustment for NO2 levels reduced the estimate (HR = 1.093; 95% CI: 1.044, 1.144), whereas the estimate for NO2 was HR = 1.080 (95% CI: 1.065, 1.096). This suggests that PM10 and NO2 represent different characteristics of the air pollution mixture that act independently, which may be related to the source of the pollution variability. In the European study, no association with NO2 was reported ( Raaschou-Nielsen et al. 2013 ).\nWe found a tendency for lower HRs in the older age category (> 65 years). This is in line with the suggestion of effect modification by age in the Rome cohort ( Cesaroni et al. 2013 ) and consistent with a previous study in Norway ( Naess et al. 2007 ). In contrast with Cesaroni et al. (2013) , we did not estimate stronger associations for men than women; and for lung cancer, associations with both exposures were significantly stronger for women than men. We did not find clear evidence of modification by socioeconomic status, which is in line with the findings in the Rome cohort.\nAlthough, in general, studies of long-term effects of air pollution on mortality qualitatively show similar results, differences in the quantitative outcomes remain.\nOur results contribute to the evidence linking long-term ambient air pollution exposure to increased nonaccidental and cause-specific mortality. Our study has several strengths. The study size is very large and includes all Dutch citizens of ≥ 30 years of age in 2004, living at least for 5 years at the 2004 address, which improves the long-term exposure classification. We used address level for all cohort members, based on the annual mean NO2 and PM10 concentrations at a 100 m × 100 m grid. Further, because of the relatively low correlation between the two air pollutant components (R = 0.58), we were able to disentangle the relative importance of the two components when adjusting for each other. We had individual information about important predictors of mortality at both the individual and ecological levels.\nApart from the strengths, there are also limitations of our study. Exposures were estimated by a LUR model for the year 2001 and assigned to the follow-up period 2004–2011. Although the exposure assignment precedes the follow-up period, we are not sure that the 2001 annual average adequately represents a longer exposure window, which is relevant for long-term exposure. However, there is evidence from the literature that spatial distribution of air pollution is stable over 10-year periods ( Cesaroni et al. 2012 ; Eeftens et al. 2011 ; Gulliver et al. 2011 ). Still, people might have moved since 2004 to unknown addresses and therefore changed their exposure.\nBecause of the limited availability of individual lifestyle factors, we adjusted for individual and area-level SES, as in the American Cancer Society study (ACS) ( Krewski et al. 2009 ) and the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) ( Beelen et al. 2014 ). The two confounders represent different “contextual” environments. Overadjustment is a possibility, but unlikely, because the correlation between the two covariates was low (–0.11).\nNo information on individual risk factors such as smoking, diet, alcohol use, and obesity was available. We evaluated the possibility that uncontrolled confounding from lifestyle factors may have biased our results using data from > 60,000 30- to 65-year-old participants of health surveys conducted in 2003–2005 by 11 Community Health Services. We do not have appropriate references to substantiate the representativeness of this subgroup in comparison to our national cohort, but because the regions were spread over the Netherlands and the goal of the surveys is to select random samples, we think that exposure ranges are well covered in the subgroup and comparable with the exposure range in the national cohort.\nAfter adjustment for age, sex, marital status, region of origin, level of education, and neighborhood social status score, mean PM10 and NO2 exposures were only 0.1 μg/m3 (PM10) and 0.5 μg/m3 (NO2) higher among current smokers compared with never smokers, and among participants with BMI > 30 compared to 18.5 < BMI < 25. When looking at the prevalence of lifestyle and sociodemographic characteristics across different categories (deciles), we found that these differences were likely driven by a higher percentage of current smokers and participants with high (> 30) BMI in the highest two deciles of PM10 and NO2 exposure.\nAs we observe associations for the whole exposure distribution, we think it is unlikely that uncontrolled confounding from smoking or BMI has substantially biased our results ( Figure 2 ; see also Supplemental Material, Tables S1–S4.)\nIn a second sensitivity analysis, we used regional age-standardized smoking attributable mortality fractions, 22–30% for men and 7–14% for women, in 40 NUTS-3 (nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) regions ( Janssen and Spriensma 2012 ). The average population in these regions is about 400,000. We found that additional adjustment in the analyses with an area-level proxy for smoking reduces the HRs but did not materially affect the conclusions of the study (see Supplemental Material, Table S5). Several cohort studies have been published with missing data on, presumably, important individual confounders (see Supplemental Material, Table S6), but most of them showed that relative risk estimates did not materially change when some additional adjustment was made by using proxies for individual risk factors on an aggregated level ( Cesaroni et al. 2013 ; Chen et al. 2013 ; Villeneuve et al. 2011 ; Zeger et al. 2008 ). In general, this suggests evidence that the lack of individual data on smoking and BMI did not bias the results in such a way that conclusions drawn on data with missing information for some individual potential confounders are materially wrong. Krewski et al. (2005a , 2005b ) showed that adjusting for self-reported smoking had little effects on the relative risk estimates in two different U.S. cohorts. In the National English Cohort ( Carey et al. 2013 ) the effect estimates were robust to adjustment for individual smoking and BMI (collected from individual patient cohorts). This was also acknowledged by Hoek et al. (2013) , who concluded that effect estimates from the three large population cohorts without individual smoking data ( Cesaroni et al. 2013 ; Crouse et al. 2012 ; Zeger et al. 2008 ) were not higher than those from the individual cohort studies.\nConclusions\nLong-term exposure to particulate air pollution (PM10) and NO2 was associated with nonaccidental mortality, mortality from respiratory diseases, and lung cancer mortality in our study population of 7 million adults. Furthermore, PM10 was associated with cardiovascular mortality. Associations with PM10 were robust to adjustment for NO2, and associations of NO2 with nonaccidental and lung cancer mortality remained after adjustment for PM10.\nReferences\nAbbey DE, Nishino N, McDonnell WF, Burchette RJ, Knutsen SF, Lawrence Beeson W, et al. 1999.
