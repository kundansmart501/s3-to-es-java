"""Aston_University""","""Making motes intelligent - Research Explorer : Aston University""","""Adaptive Communications Networks Research Group\nAbstract\nIn-Motes is a mobile agent middleware that generates an intelligent framework for deploying applications in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In-Motes is based on the injection of mobile agents into the network that can migrate or clone following specific rules and performing application specific tasks. By doing so, each mote is given a certain degree of perception, cognition and control, forming the basis for its intelligence. Our middleware incorporates technologies such as Linda-like tuplespaces and federated system architecture in order to obtain a high degree of collaboration and coordination for the agent society. A set of behavioral rules inspired by a community of bacterial strains is also generated as the means for robustness of the WSN. In this paper, we present In-Motes and provide a detailed evaluation of its implementation for MICA2 motes.\n""","1.0","""https://research.aston.ac.uk/portal/en/researchoutput/making-motes-intelligent(8335e874-d732-4a9e-a22c-001a5f291088).html""","[-1.888803,52.487018]"

To address this requirement, a new multiple-input multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple access (MIMO-NOMA) scheme is designed in this paper, where one user is served with its quality of service requirement strictly met, and the other user is served opportunistically by using the NOMA concept. The novelty of this new scheme is that it confronts the challenge that the existing MIMO-NOMA schemes rely on the assumption that users' channel conditions are different, a strong assumption which may not be valid in practice. The developed precoding and detection strategies can effectively create a significant difference between the users' effective channel gains, and therefore, the potential of NOMA can be realized even if the users' original channel conditions are similar. Analytical and numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed MIMO-NOMA scheme.\nLancaster University Bailrigg Lancaster United Kingdom LA1 4YW\n+44 (0)1524 65201\n""","2.5400085","""http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/mimonoma-design-for-small-packet-transmission-in-the-internet-of-things(60141433-e238-44be-9c6d-b6b921cb41f6).html""","[-2.787729,54.010394]"

In this paper, we consider the application of monitoring power usage in an office environment at the resolution of individual users. A key challenge in this context is how to extract meaningful profiles of user behaviour in the large volume of monitoring data collected by the WSN. To manage the complexity of learning such profiles in this context, we propose a query based model for profiling. This query based model provides the ability to characterize the spatial and temporal occurrences of the power usage patterns of interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our query-based profiling model for finding relevant electricity usage patterns in a real life data set of power measurements collected by a WSN deployment in an office environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a case study has been made on analysing the power usage of users at such a fine scale in an office environment.\nItem Type:\n""","1.0","""http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/136578/""","[-4.28836,55.871751]"

Network congestion caused by heavy M2M traffic is tackled using load balancing solutions to maintain high levels of network performance. Firstly, a Multilevel Clustering Multiple Sinks (MLCMS) with IPv6 protocol over Low Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) is promoted to prolong network lifetime. Secondly, enhanced network performance is achieved through linear integer-based optimisation. A Self-Organising Cluster Head to Sink Algorithm (SOCHSA) is proposed, hosting Discrete Particle Swarm Optimisation (DPSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) as Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to solve the network performance optimisation problem. Network Performance is measured based on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for load fairness and average residual network energy. The SOCHSA algorithm is tested by two benchmark problems with two and three sinks. DPSO and GA are compared with the Exhaustive Search (ES) algorithm to analyse their performances for each benchmark problem. Both algorithms achieve optimum network performance evaluation values of 108.059 and 108.1686 in the benchmark problems P1 and P2, respectively. Using three sinks under the same simulation settings, the average residual energy is improved by 2% when compared to two sinks. Computational results prove that DPSO outperforms GA regarding complexity and convergence, thus being best suited for a proactive Internet of Things (IoT) network. The proposed mechanism satisfies different network performance requirements of M2M traffic by instant identification and dynamic rerouting.\nURI: \n""","1.0","""http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/14580""","[-0.472855,51.532848]"

This raises pertinent questions such as: how these technologies shape children’s activity; how the data from their activity is used, and to what extent children, and their parents, are cognisant of the technology. This paper examines these questions in light of an emerging technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), by drawing upon three investigations (deskbased, home context, school context) into two commercially successful IoT designs (Skylanders and Disney Infinity). Whilst these particular games are limited in what activity they capture, the research illustrates how the digitalisation of everyday objects (toys) can influence both attitudes and behaviour, and generate potentially revealing data about children’s everyday activity; yet with little reflection from parents or children. Encouragingly, the research also showed children’s potential, with support, not just to understand, but design with this technology.\n""","2.5400085","""http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/three-questions-about-the-internet-of-things-and-children(86a0ba29-04dd-447e-8a16-b88063f84a7b).html""","[-3.187347,55.947691]"

The scheme is validated through simulation, which indicates the proposed traffic flow management policy outperforms the current traffic management policy. Specifically, simulation results show that the proposed model achieves an enhancement in QoS performance for the MTC traffic flows, including a decrease of 99.45% in Packet Loss Ratio (PLR), a decrease of 99.89% in packet End To End (E2E) delay, a decrease of 99.21% in Packet Delay Variation (PDV). Furthermore, it retains the perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) of the real time application users within high satisfaction levels, such as the VoLTE service possessing a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 4.349 and enhancing the QoS of a video conference service within the standardised values of a 3GPP body, with a decrease of 85.28% in PLR, a decrease of 85% in packet E2E delay and a decrease of 88.5% in PDV.\nURI: \n""","1.0","""http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/15432""","[-0.472855,51.532848]"

QoI essentially estimates the probability that the information available from the network is correct. Knowledge of the QoI would clearly be of great use to decision makers using a network. An important class of sensors, that provide inputs to networks in real-life, are concerned with target tracking. Assessing the tracking performance of these sensors is an essential component in estimating the QoI of the whole network. We have investigated three potential QoI metrics for estimating the dynamic target tracking performance of systems based on some state estimation algorithms. We have tested them on different scenarios with varying degrees of tracking difficulty. We performed experiments on simulated data so that we have a ground truth against which to assess the performance of each metric. Our measure of ground truth is the Euclidean distance between the estimated position and the true position. Recently researchers have suggested using the entropy of the covariance matrix as a metric of QoI [1][2]. Two of our metrics were based on this approach, the first being the entropy of the co-variance matrix relative to an ideal distribution, and the second is the information gain at each update of the covariance matrix. The third metric was calculated by smoothing the residual likelihood value at each new measurement point, similar to the model update likelihood function in an IMM filter. Our experiment results show that reliable QoI metrics cannot be formulated by using solely the covariance matrices. In other words it is possible that a covariance matrix can have high information content, while the position estimate is wrong. On the other hand the smoothed residual likelihood does correlate well with tracking performance, and can be measured without knowledge of the true target position.\n© (2009) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Routine maintenance, fault detection and correction is dicult, infrequent and expensive. Further-more, for long-term deployments in excess of a year, a node's limited power supply tightly constrains the amount of processing power and long-range communication available. In order to support the long-term autonomous behaviour of a WSN system, a self-diagnostic algorithm implemented on the sensor nodes is needed for sensor fault detection. This algorithm has to be robust, so that sensors are not misdiagnosed as faulty to ensure that data loss is kept to a minimum, and it has to be light-weight, so that it can run continuously on a low power microprocessor for the full deployment period. Addition-ally, it has to be self-adapative so that any long-term degradation ofsensors is monitored and the self-diagnostic algorithm can continuously revise its own rules to accomodate for this degradation. This paper de-scribes the development, testing and implementation of a heuristically determined, robust, self-diagnostic algorithm that achieves these goals.\nLancaster University Bailrigg Lancaster United Kingdom LA1 4YW\n+44 (0)1524 65201\n""","1.0","""http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-development-of-a-wireless-sensor-network-sensing-node-utilising-adaptive-selfdiagnostics(d8a14e0a-3d95-4fe0-8518-1675f3ba3ae6).html""","[-2.787729,54.010394]"

These smart devices and sensors will be found in our homes, our cars, our workplaces, etc., and have the potential to revolutionise how we interact with the world today. The slew of data generated by such a volume of devices necessitates the use of smart, autonomous machine-to-machine (M2M) communications; however, this necessarily poses serious security and privacy issues as we will no longer have direct control over with whom and what our devices communicate. This could potentially open up new attack vectors for criminal hackers to exploit through the use of malicious or tampered IoT devices. Compounding the problem is that to enable the ubiquitous nature of the IoT, the embedded devices themselves are often low-cost, low-power, throwaway units which are restricted both in memory and computing power. Generally, low-cost devices targeted at the IoT space, such as the ARM Cortex-M® or the Atmel tinyAVR® families of microcontroller units (MCUs), contain little if any embedded security features. Their lightweight nature is such that even highly optimised cryptographic implementations targeted at specific MCU still require a significant timing, and corresponding energy, overhead [9]. Hence, it is clear we need a new approach to securing the IoT. In this chapter, we outline the proposed use of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for the provision of IoT device security.\nDOI\nResearch output: Chapter in Book/Report/Conference proceeding › Conference contribution\nFingerprint\nT: +44 (0)28 9024 5133\nEmergency T: +44 (0)28 9097 2222\n© Queen's University Belfast 2017,\n""","2.2379003","""http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/lightweight-cryptographic-identity-solutions-for-the-internet-of-things(2b0cefcc-c4c2-411c-9b2a-b7cf1e161eed).html""","[-5.934759,54.583863]"

Results of a series of real experimental tests regarding connectivity, sensing and network performance are then discussed. The analysis of link characteristics in the car-park scenario shows unexpected reliability patterns which have a strong influence on MAC and routing protocol design. Two unexpected link reliability patterns are identified and documented. First, the presence of the objects (cars) being sensed can cause significant interference and degradation in communication performance. Second, link quality has a high temporal correlation but a low spatial correlation. From these observations we conclude that a) the construction and maintenance of a fixed topology is not useful and b) spatial rather than temporal message replicates can improve transport reliability.\nLancaster University Bailrigg Lancaster United Kingdom LA1 4YW\n+44 (0)1524 65201\n""","1.0","""http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/carpark-management-using-wireless-sensor-networks(a3dda169-2631-451c-929f-b8d1311fbb64).html""","[-2.787729,54.010394]"

To maximize the detection probability of intruders with a limited number of sensors, we propose an integer non-linear program optimization model which considers multiple types of sensors and targets, probabilistic detection functions and sensor-reliability issues. An agent-based simulation (ABS) model is used to validate the analytic results and evaluate the performance of the WSN under more realistic conditions, such as intruders moving along random paths. Our experiment shows that the results from the optimization model are consistent with the results from the ABS model. This increases our confidence in the ABS model and allows us to conduct a further experiment using moving intruders, which is more realistic, but it is challenging to find an analytic solution. This experiment shows the complementary benefits of using optimization and ABS models.\nLancaster University Bailrigg Lancaster United Kingdom LA1 4YW\n+44 (0)1524 65201\n""","1.0","""http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/validating-an-integer-nonlinear-program-optimization-model-of-a-wireless-sensor-network-using-agentbased-simulation(85ef1a77-f69a-4bed-a603-2247fb429098).html""","[-2.787729,54.010394]"

However, the growing scale of networks has made such a scheduling problem more and more challenging, as existing set cover and evolutionary algorithms become unable to provide satisfactory efficiency due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, a Kuhn-Munkres parallel genetic algorithm is developed to solve the set cover problem and is applied to lifetime maximization of large-scale wireless sensor networks. The proposed algorithm schedules the sensors into a number of disjoint complete cover sets and activates them in batch for energy conservation. It uses a divide-and-conquer strategy of dimensionality reduction, and the polynomial Kuhn-Munkres algorithm are hence adopted to splice the feasible solutions obtained in each subarea to enhance the search efficiency substantially. To further improve global efficiency, a redundant-trend sensor schedule strategy is developed. Additionally, we meliorate the evaluation function through penalizing incomplete cover sets, which speeds up convergence. Eight types of experiments are conducted on a distributed platform to test and inform the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results show that it offers promising performance in terms of the convergence rate, solution quality, and success rate.\nItem Type:\n""","1.0","""http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/118977/""","[-4.28836,55.871751]"

Signals from multiple sensors are commonly fused to maximize fidelity of detection through for example synergy between different modes of detection, or simple confirmation. We have previously demonstrated the ability to calculate the meaning of a location report as a probability distribution over potential ground truths by using a stochastic process algebraic model compiled to a discrete-state, continuous-time Markov chain, and performing a transient analysis which resembles the process of parameterizing a Bayesian network. We introduce an approach to representing temporal fusion of multiple heterogeneous sensor detections with different modalities and timing characteristics using a stochastic process algebra. This facilitates analysis of probabilistic properties of the system, and inclusion of those properties into larger models. The formal models are translated into continuous time Markov chains, which provide an important trade-off between the approximation of timing information against complexity of analysis. This is vital to the investigation of analytic computation in real world problems. We illustrate this with an example detection-oriented sensing service model emphasizing the impact of timing. Detection probability and confidence is an essential aspect of the quality of information delivered by a sensing service. The present work is part of an effort to develop a formal event detection calculus that captures the essence of sensor information relating to events, such that features and dependencies can be exploited in re-usable, extendible compositional models.\n© (2009) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Nodes can be either sleeping, where no transmission or reception can occur, or awake where traffic is processed. Increasing the proportion of time spent in the sleeping state will decrease throughput and increase packet loss and delivery delay. However there is a complex relationship between sleeping time and energy consumption. Increasing the sleeping time does not always lead to an increase in the energy saved. We identify the energy consumption profile for various levels of sensor network activity and derive an optimum energy saving curve that provides a basis for the design of extended-life ad hoc wireless sensor networks.\nBibliographic note\nThis modeling work demonstrated multi-criterion optimization of the efficiency of sensor network communications protocols, and showed that the conventional approach of using hop by hop LAN protocols would not be optimal in low traffic, intermittent networks.

Constraints on cost and power consumption make it infeasible to equip each sensor node in the network with a Global Position System (GPS) unit, especially for large-scale WSNs. A promising method to localize unknown nodes is to use mobile anchor nodes (MANs), which are equipped with GPS units moving among unknown nodes and periodically broadcasting their current locations to help nearby unknown nodes with localization. A considerable body of research has addressed the Mobile Anchor Node Assisted Localization (MANAL) problem. However to the best of our knowledge, no updated surveys on MAAL reflecting recent advances in the field have been presented in the past few years. This survey presents a review of the most successful MANAL algorithms, focusing on the achievements made in the past decade, and aims to become a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in MANAL research field. In addition, we seek to present a comprehensive review of the recent breakthroughs in the field, providing links to the most interesting and successful advances in this research field.\nDOI\n""","1.0","""http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/a-survey-on-mobile-anchor-node-assisted-localization-in-wireless-sensor-networks(e5bd4e22-635f-4d27-a0da-cdda809ceba0).html""","[-5.934759,54.583863]"

We present the design of a comprehensive and lightweight semantic description model for knowledge representation in the IoT domain. The design follows the widely recognised best practices in knowledge engineering and ontology modelling. Users are allowed to extend the model by linking to external ontologies, knowledge bases or existing linked data. Scalable access to IoT services and resources is achieved through a distributed, semantic storage design. The usefulness of the model is also illustrated through an IoT service discovery method.\nReferences\n""","1.9050064","""https://automatika.korema.hr/index.php/automatika/article/view/414""","[-0.589514,51.242722]"

The joint problem of subcarrier assignment, subcarrier pairing and power allocations is formulated under scenarios of using and not using cooperative jamming to maximize the secrecy sum rate subject to limited power budget at the relay station and orthogonal subcarrier allocation policies. The optimization problems are shown to be mixed integer programming and non-convex. For the scenario without cooperative jamming, we propose an asymptotically optimal algorithm based on the dual decomposition method, and a suboptimal algorithm with lower complexity. For the scenario with cooperative jamming, the resulting optimization problem is non-convex, and we propose a heuristic algorithm based on alternating optimization. Finally, the proposed schemes are evaluated by simulations and compared to the existing schemes.\nDownload statistics\n""","1.0","""https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/secure-resource-allocation-for-ofdma-twoway-relay-wireless-sensor-networks-without-and-with-cooperative-jamming(d8ad1325-0cd2-4310-a900-8e4b0e0a1f11).html""","[-0.116938,51.510732]"

Communication will be affected by local conditions, platform characteristics and power consumption constraints, and sensors may be lost during an engagement. It is clearly of great importance to decision makers to know what quality of information they can expect from a network in battlefield situations.

Two sensor nodes can establish a secure link with some probability based on the information stored in their memories though it is not always possible that two sensor nodes may set up a secure link. In this paper, we propose a new approach that elects trusted common nodes called ”Proxies” which reside on an existing secure path linking two sensor nodes. These sensor nodes are used to send the generated key which will be divided into parts (nuggets) according to the number of elected proxies. Our approach has been assessed against previously developed algorithms and the results show that our algorithm discovers proxies more quickly which are closer to both end nodes, thus producing shorter path lengths. We have also assessed the impact of our algorithm on the average time to establish a secure link when the transmitter and receiver of the sensor nodes are ”ON”. The results show the superiority of our algorithm in this regard. Overall, the proposed algorithm is well suited for Wireless Sensor Networks.\nDOI\nResearch output: Contribution to journal › Article\nFingerprint\nT: +44 (0)28 9024 5133\nEmergency T: +44 (0)28 9097 2222\n© Queen's University Belfast 2017,\n""","1.0","""http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/efficient-path-key-establishment-for-wireless-sensor-networks(b4fe063f-081a-4ed9-9489-387882810ab0).html""","[-5.934759,54.583863]"

However, these processes and applications depend on reliable collection, distribution and delivery of information that, typically, travels over multiple interconnecting nodes to reach processing centres, and are susceptible to various disruptions such as the ones caused caused by message drops, packet loss and loss of connectivity due to high traffic volumes and noise on the wireless medium. In this paper, we investigate and present approaches to pro-actively adapt routing over such networks by forecasting potential faulty regions of the network based on previous trends and reorganising routing paths. We have prototyped this approach in the ITA Sensor Fabric, an evolving middleware infrastructure for sensor networks. We, further, provide some preliminary results based on simulations.\n© (2011) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Since missions might compete for the exclusive usage of the same sensing resource we need to assign individual sensors to missions. Missions are usually characterized by an uncertain demand for sensing resource capabilities. In this paper we model this assignment problem by introducing the Sensor Utility Maximization (SUM) model, where each sensor-mission pair is associated with a utility offer. Moreover each mission is associated with a priority and with an uncertain utility demand. We also define the benefit or profit that a sensor can bring to a mission as the fraction of mission's demand that the sensor is able to satisfy, scaled by the priority of the mission. The goal is to find a sensor assignment that maximizes the total profit, while ensuring that the total utility cumulated by each mission does not exceed its uncertain demand. SUM is NP-Complete and is a special case of the well known Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP), which groups many knapsack-style problems. We compare four algorithms: two previous algorithms for problems related to SUM, an improved implementation of a state-of-the-art pre-existing approximation algorithm for GAP, and a new greedy algorithm. Simulation results show that our greedy algorithm appears to offer the best trade-off between quality of solution and computation cost.\n© (2008) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

The technological underpinnings of the IoT are discussed in the context of a rapidly developing new field of technology and with an acknowledgement that there is some way to go before commonly accepted standards are agreed upon and that the commercial case, particularly in the domestic sphere, for the IoT is yet to be made. Examples of current IoT deployments across a range of sectors are presented. This paper also explores some of the social issues surrounding the IoT where security and privacy concerns are inhibiting the diffusion of IoT products and services and where much work needs to be done if end-users are to accept this new technology. Driving the development of IoT technologies is the demand for data and the potential for a revolution in how we understand our environments through the embedding of sensors and computational intelligence in everyday objects. The collection and analysis of this data will create new types of companies and change the business models of many existing ones. It is uncertain what the IoT landscape will look like in 2020 but the opportunities for data experts are considerable.\nItem Type:\n""","2.5576005","""http://eprints.brighton.ac.uk/17339/""","[-0.11917,50.842454]"

A variety of key predistribution schemes have been proposed which allocate symmetric keys to the sensor nodes before deployment. In this paper we examine the role of expander graphs in key predistribution schemes for wireless sensor networks. Roughly speaking, a graph has good expansion if every ‘small’ subset of vertices has a ‘large’ neighbourhood, and intuitively, expansion is a desirable property for graphs of networks. It has been claimed that good expansion in the product graph is necessary for ‘optimal’ networks. We demonstrate flaws in this claim, argue instead that good expansion is desirable in the intersection graph, and discuss how this can be achieved. We then consider key predistribution schemes based on expander graph constructions and compare them to other schemes in the literature. Finally, we propose the use of expansion and other graph-theoretical techniques as metrics for assessing key predistribution schemes and their resulting wireless sensor networks.\nKeywords\nWireless Sensor Networks Key Predistribution Expander Graphs \nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access\nPreview\nUnable to display preview.  Download preview PDF.\nReferences\nAnalyzing Graphs, http://docs.yworks.com/yfiles/doc/developers-guide/analysis.html\n2.\nBlackburn, S.R., Martin, K.M., Paterson, M.B., Stinson, D.R.: Key Refreshing in Wireless Sensor Networks.

However, the harsh environment of the gas turbine engine provides a number of challenges to deployment of wireless sensors. A definitive study of the impact of harsh environments on WSNs is currently lacking, which represents an obstacle to WSN's deployment in safety-critical industrial instrumentation and automation. In this study, the authors report the test results of applying WSNs to data acquisition in gas turbine engine testing and the development of a realistic software simulator with the purpose of de-risking the wireless data transmission technology in a project called WIDAGATE (wireless data acquisition in gas turbine engine testing). This study provides an overview of the simulation platform developed and investigates how small-scale tests of a WSN deployed on a real engine were used to validate and improve the simulator platform. This work proposes realistic modelling of the physical layer (radio channel) when subject to interference in harsh industry environment during aero-engine testing. Based on the validated, realistic physical layer model, different medium access control protocols are simulated to demonstrate how this improved simulator can be used to select an appropriate protocol.\nPublication data is maintained in RPS.

Data aggregation is a common method used in sensor networks to reduce the amount of messages transported. By aggregating, the data contained in several messages is fused into one single message. Therefore, data aggregation significantly influences the overall data transport reliability observed at the sink.

Although some methods exist to address the problem in homogeneous WSNs, research on this problem in heterogeneous WSNs have progressed at a slow pace. Inspired by the promising performance of ant colony optimization (ACO) to solve combinatorial problems, this paper proposes an ACO-based approach that can maximize the lifetime of heterogeneous WSNs. The methodology is based on finding the maximum number of disjoint connected covers that satisfy both sensing coverage and network connectivity. A construction graph is designed with each vertex denoting the assignment of a device in a subset. Based on pheromone and heuristic information, the ants seek an optimal path on the construction graph to maximize the number of connected covers. The pheromone serves as a metaphor for the search experiences in building connected covers. The heuristic information is used to reflect the desirability of device assignments. A local search procedure is designed to further improve the search efficiency. The proposed approach has been applied to a variety of heterogeneous WSNs. The results show that the approach is effective and efficient in finding high-quality solutions for maximizing the lifetime of heterogeneous WSNs.\nItem Type:\n""","1.0","""http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/51335/""","[-4.28836,55.871751]"

One such property is source location privacy (SLP). The original SLP problem is to protect the location of a source node in a WSN from a single distributed eavesdropper attacker. Several techniques have been proposed to address the SLP problem, and most of them use some form of traffic analysis and engineering to provide enhanced SLP. The use of fake sources is considered to be promising for providing SLP, and several works have investigated the effectiveness of the fake sources approach under various attacker models. However, very little work has been done to understand the theoretical underpinnings of the fake source technique. In this paper, we (i) provide a novel formalisation of the fake sources selection problem; (ii) prove the fake sources selection problem to be NP-complete; (iii) provide parametric heuristics for three different network configurations; and (iv) show that these heuristics provide (near) optimal levels of SLP under appropriate parameterisation. Our results show that fake sources can provide a high level of SLP. Our work is the first to investigate the theoretical underpinnings of the fake source technique.

Alternative designs following a classical multi-threaded approach are also available. A popular implementation of such a multi-threaded sensor network operating system is MANTIS. The event-based TinyOS is more energy efficient than the multi-threaded MANTIS system. However, MANTIS is more capable than TinyOS of supporting time critical tasks as task preemption is supported. Thus, timeliness can be traded for energy efficiency by choosing the appropriate operating system. In this paper we present a MANTIS kernel modification that enables MANTIS to be as power efficient as TinyOS. Results from an experimental analysis demonstrate that the modified MANTIS can be used to fit both sensor network design goals of energy efficiency and timeliness.\nLancaster University Bailrigg Lancaster United Kingdom LA1 4YW\n+44 (0)1524 65201\n""","1.0","""http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/improving-the-energy-efficiency-of-the-mantis-kernel(a5df52ed-eb2f-42f5-914e-a0dc78d1b233).html""","[-2.787729,54.010394]"

The convergence of the Internet, telecommunications, and novel information technologies with techniques for miniaturisation now provides vast opportunities for the development and application of low-cost monitoring solutions which could drastically increase the spatial and temporal resolution of environmental data. The paper describes the development of a prototype monitoring system which bridges advances in wireless sensor networks with advances in hydraulic and water quality modeling. The prototype monitoring system was deployed at Boston Water and Sewer Commission (BWSC) in December 2004, and it has been successfully collecting and charting near-real time hydraulic and water quality data as well as data from combined sewer outflows (CSO). The remote monitoring system has unique functionalities in terms of sampling rates (up to 1000 S/s), time synchronization (up to 1 ms) and in-network processing. These features create novel opportunities for wirelessly collecting data for applications such as hydraulic pressure transients, remote acoustic leak detection together with low-duty cycle applications such as monitoring water quality parameters and water levels in CSOs. The trial with BWSC has been tremendously useful to prototype hardware and software tools, and to identify deployment and operational challenges in using sensor networks for monitoring and management of large scale water supply systems. This paper was presented at the 8th Annual Water Distribution Systems Analysis Symposium which was held with the generous support of Awwa Research Foundation (AwwaRF).\n""","1.0","""https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/40941%28247%29100""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"
