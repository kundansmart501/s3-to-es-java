PhD thesis, University of Liverpool.\nText\nDownload (6MB)\nAbstract\nFast diminishing fossil fuel resources, deterioration in air quality and concerns for environmental protection, continuously promote the interest in the research and development of Alternative Energy Vehicles (AEVs). Traction motor drive is an integral part and common electric propulsion system in all kinds of AEVs. It plays an utmost significant role in the development of electrified transport industry. Application of Induction Motor (IM) drive is not only limited to the domestic and industrial applications but also has an ubiquitous influence in the modern electrified transport sector. IM is characterized by a simple and rugged structure, operational reliability, low maintenance, low cost, ability to operate in a hostile environment and high dynamic performance. However, IM is one of the widely accepted choices by Electric Vehicles (EVs) manufacturer. At present, Variable speed IM drive is almost replacing the traditional DC motor drive in a wide range of applications including EVs where a fast dynamic response is required. It became possible after the technological advancement and development in the field of power switching devices, digital signal processing and recently intelligent control systems have led to great improvements in the dynamic performance of traction drives. Speed Sensorless control strategies offer better system’s reliability and robustness and reduce the drive cost, size and maintenance requirements. Sensorless IM drives have been applied on medium and high speed applications successfully. However, instability at low speed and under different load disturbance conditions are still a critical problem in this research field and has not been robustly achieved. Some application such as traction drives and cranes are required to maintain the desired level of torque down to low speed levels with uncertain load torque disturbance conditions. Speed and torque control is more important particularly in motor-in-wheel traction drive train configuration EVs where vehicle wheel rim is directly connected to the motor shaft to control the speed and torque. The main purpose of this research is to improve the dynamic performance of conventional proportional-integral controller based model reference adaptive system (PI-MRAS) speed observer by using several speed profiles under different load torque disturbance conditions, which is uncertain during the whole vehicle operation apart from the vehicle own load. Since, vehicle has to face different road conditions and aerodynamic effects which continuously change the net load torque effect on the traction drive. This thesis proposes different novel methods based on the fuzzy logic control (FLC) and sliding mode control (SMC) with rotor flux MRAS. Numerous simulations and experimental tests designed with respect to the EV operation are carried out to investigate the speed estimation performance of the proposed schemes and compared with the PI-MRAS speed observer. For simulation and experimental purpose, Matlab-Simulink environment and dSPACE DS-1104 controller board are used respectively. The results presented in this thesis show great performance improvements of the proposed schemes in speed estimation & load disturbance rejection capability and provide a suitable choice of speed sensoless IM drive control for EVs with cost effectiveness.\nItem Type:\n""","1.0","""https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3008062/""","[-2.96826,53.408471]"

The main objective of this research paper is to assess the advances in the competitiveness of the pan-European rail freight services operated by a new-entrant (private) operator. Its main focus is to assess and contribute to the understanding of the advances towards competitiveness and the future prospects in the open European rail freight market, including dealing with challenges (e.g. dormant and departure of partners, suspension of the project, indistinct roles and responsibilities of operating partners) at different phases of the research, development and service offerings, that will be an important contribution to the Research and Development (R&D) policy and management arena in the Europe rail freight transport sector. The current research applies a case study research approach. The assessment of the rail freight service is performed by conducting two phases: first, a comparison of the progress between first and second year of the REorganisation of Transport networks by advanced RAil freight Concepts (RETRACK) rail freight service, operated by a new entrant and conducted on the corridor between two hubs – Cologne, Germany, and Györ, Hungary, and secondly a comparison of the opinions of customers on the RETRACK service and its competitors. From the comparative study between the first and second years, the study finds that the new-entrant operator was able to offer an increased number of services by consolidating cargo from satellite connections at both ends of the operational corridor by adopting a pragmatic and flexible approach. The customer satisfaction survey suggests that the new-entrant operator offered better service in terms of price, transit time, reliability and information flow/management compared to its competitors' services (offered by incumbent rail operators) on the corridor. However, their service was inferior to that of its competitors, in terms of frequency and availability of service. These less-well performed service factors have improved gradually over time. The study suggests that intra-rail competition has improved, but that inter-modal completion is yet to be achieved. The ups and downs of the project provide important lessons for R&D management, academia and policy makers. The study suggests that a pan-European rail freight service can be efficiently and effectively run by new-entrant operators, and this will lead to more intra-modal competition. However, they have yet to achieve competitiveness that will result in a shift of cargo from road to rail by offering an improved service that at least matches the major attributes of road freight service, e.g. price, transit time, door-to-door service and working in a collaborative way with other actors.\n""","2.2972329","""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/radm.12135/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+usage+report+download+page+will+be+unavailable+on+Friday+24th+November+2017+at+21%3A00+EST+%2F+02.00+GMT+%2F+10%3A00+SGT+%28Saturday+25th+Nov+for+SGT+""","[-1.615713,54.98032]"

Wages and electricity prices and consumption were found to have statistically significant elasticities and evidence of potential substitution effects between factors. Other factors, such as driver productivity, network length, percentage of rolling stock with air conditioning, and rolling stock age, also showed statistically significant elasticities.

For this reason it has been considered as a parameter that could be used to reduce the carbon emissions of the existing and future global fleet of ships. Operational speed is an economic function of market conditions (freight rate) and the costs of operation (e.g., bunker fuel costs, cost of additional ships to meet the equivalent output) because along with the ship size, speed determines the industry’s supply. Therefore speed can also be a cost-effective increase in energy efficiency for the ship owner and operator, although the level to which this is attractive will vary over time according to the agent’s tradeoffs between revenue and cost. This paper reviews existing literature in order to highlight some of the common assumptions and ideas in the pertinent subject areas: energy efficiency, engineering, economics, environmental impact. Models are developed and their initial results presented, in order to interrogate the sensitivities of some of these assumptions. There is also discussion of the subject of speed in the evolving policy and regulatory discussion at IMO.\nPublication data is maintained in RPS.

Human operators can confirm if each is truly empty by physical inspection or by examination of an X-ray image. However, the huge number transported means that confirmation is far from complete. Thus, empty containers offer an opportunity for criminals to smuggle contraband. We report an algorithm for automatically detecting loads in cargo containers from transmission X-ray images. Detection without generation of excessive false positives is complicated by the fabric of the container, container variation, damage, and detritus. The algorithm detects 99.3% of loads in stream-of-commerce date while raising false alarms on 0.7% of actually empty containers. On challenging data, created by image synthesis, we are able to achieve 90% detection of loads with the same size and attenuation as a 1.5 kg cube of cocaine or 1 L of water, while triggering fewer than 1-in-605 or 1-in-197 false alarms respectively, on truly empty containers. The algorithm analyses each small window of the image separately, and detects loads within the window by random forest classification of texture features together with the window coordinates.\nPublication data is maintained in RPS.

These and a few other constraints allow a new model for projecting regional and world travel, which we use to develop a scenario for carbon emissions from passenger transport. Globally, carbon emissions rise from 0.8 GtC in 1990 to 2.7 GtC in 2050. In every industrialized region aircraft and high-speed trains become the dominant mode; unable to satisfy the rising demand for mobility within a fixed travel time budget, automobile travel declines by 2050. Passenger transport carbon emissions stabilize by 2020 without any further policy intervention. But in developing countries automobile travel is still rising and becomes the dominant source of carbon dioxide from passenger transport. Fear of global warming may require stabilization of these emissions by mid-century. We show that without some action to accelerate an improvement in energy efficiency starting in the next decade, the goal of stabilization is a technically impossible task, unless zero-carbon technologies become available.\nPublication data is maintained in RPS.

This paper presents a split converter-fed four-phase switched reluctance motor (SRM) drive to realize flexible integrated charging functions (dc and ac sources). The machine is featured with a central-tapped winding node, eight stator slots, and six rotor poles (8/6). In the driving mode, the developed topology has the same characteristics as the traditional asymmetric bridge topology but better fault tolerance. The proposed system supports battery energy balance and on-board dc and ac charging. When connecting with an ac power grid, the proposed topology has a merit of the multilevel converter; the charging current control can be achieved by the improved hysteresis control. The energy flow between the two batteries is balanced by the hysteresis control based on their state-of-charge conditions. Simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink and experiments on a 150-W prototype SRM validate the effectiveness of the proposed technologies, which may provide a solution to EV charging issues associated with significant infrastructure requirements.\nDocuments\nSplit converter-fed SRM drive for flexible charging in EVHEV applications\nRights statement: © 2015 IEEE.

Different components in a vehicle have to constantly exchange available information with other vehicles on the road and cooperate for the purpose of ensuring safety and comfort using a Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET). Critical information like navigation, cooperative collision avoidance, lane-changing, speed limit, accident, obstacle or road condition warnings, etc. play a significant role for safety-related applications in VANET. Such kind of critical information gathering and dissemination is challenging, because of their delay-sensitive nature. This paper proposes an agent based model that consists of heavy-weight static cognitive (based on Belief Desire Intention : BDI) and light-weight mobile agents. Proposed model executes push (gather/store and disseminate) and pull (gather/store) operations on information gathered based on information relevance, criticalness and importance. The simulation results show that BDI based information gathering and dissemination scheme performs better than the reliable broadcast scheme in terms of bandwidth utilization, packet delivery ratio, push latency (information saturation time) and push/pull decision latency.\nKeywords\nVehicular ad hoc networks Cognitive agents BDI architecture \nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access\nPreview\nUnable to display preview.  Download preview PDF.\nReferences\n1.\nCaliskan, M., Mauve, M., Rech, B., & Luebke, A.

Planning and scheduling activities relevant to the rail industry.\nThe think tank group was made up of senior representatives of Network Rail and other corporate partners of the wider AUTONOM project. Of particular interest to this group was the area of planning and scheduling in relation to autonomous systems and the potential advantages such systems can bring. The four areas shown in Figure 1 demonstrate the potential for automation and have been highlighted as priority areas by Network Rail and the authors. The following subject areas are investigated in more detail in relation to the elements outlined in Figure 1 .\nAutonomous systems\nSuch systems may range from semi-automated to totally autonomous (without human intervention) operation. Semi-automated operation includes European train control system (ETCS) in-cab signalling and automated train braking systems. Fully automated operation examples include the automated operation of trains.\nData mining\nThe practice of data mining is the identification of structural patterns in data and links between data points that are not readily discoverable. Rail industry data collected from train-based and wayside sensors provide a vast potential repository for data mining.\nKnowledge engineering frameworks\nKnowledge engineering is similar to the discipline of software engineering; it turns the process of constructing knowledge-based systems from an art into an engineering discipline. Such practice is required in the design of new information management systems for rail.\nExpert and decision support systems\nAn expert system is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert; they can also provide decision-making support. A decision support system aids a user in their decision-making by providing possible solutions for a problem area. Decision support can be seen in the use of more sophisticated rail scheduling software.\nSemantic technologies\nOntologies can be thought of as maps between vocabularies that allow document creators to know how to describe their documents. The wide variety of protocols for the transfer of data in rail applications provides the opportunity for semantic description of such data to aid interoperability.\nPlanning and scheduling: Approaches that can be applied\nSection:\nPlanning and scheduling is a wide subject area relating to both manufacturing and service industries (Pinedo 1 ). In manufacturing one of the most common uses of scheduling is in the flow shop. Cheng et al. 2 describe such a case where the scheduling of jobs through batch processing machines is considered. Within the rail industry scheduling can apply to a variety of topics as evidenced in Figure 1 . The work of Cao et al. 3 examines the problem of mixed-speed train scheduling on a high-speed line; where the flow of trains, travelling at different rates along a rail line, must be continuous. Rail maintenance scheduling has been addressed by Lautala and Pouryousef 4 who describe a preventive maintenance scheduling problem modelling approach for preventative maintenance. In this approach parameters related to specific line specifications, drawn from three high-speed line case studies, are defined as a series of descriptive analytical tables. One of the more recent areas for investigation in relation to rail industry scheduling problems has been the use of soft computing techniques. Hu et al. 5 propose a scheduling approach utilising a particle swarm algorithm to optimise the scheduling within an urban rail network, based on data hosted in a cloud repository.\nAutonomous systems\nAutonomous systems can contain complex control logic often incorporating computational intelligence techniques such as fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms. Such systems are linked to physical objects to provide sensing capabilities, to control the motion of mobile hardware assets and activities of both fixed and mobile assets. Agents are one avenue of research for the autonomous control of assets. Agents are said to embody two principles: an ability to act autonomously and the capability to interact with other agents (Wooldridge 6 ). Multi-agent systems are then, by definition, interacting collections of agents (Wooldridge 6 ).\nFisher 7 has investigated the design and evaluation of agents providing a framework for the temporal execution of agent designs. This work was motivated by the lack of such a framework and methods to assess the actual behaviour of agents once designed.\nLearning algorithms have also been employed in the control of autonomous systems. Reinforcement learning is likened by Sutton 8 to a mapping between situations and actions in response to a reward. Reinforcement learning is prominent in autonomous control research and agent theory. Policy search is a technique from the area of reinforcement learning in which a probability distribution is assigned to a set of possible actions. Deisenroth and Rasmussen 9 put forward an approach for data-efficient policy search and apply it to control tasks such as the cart-pole learning task.\nThe subject of autonomous real-time planning has been investigated by Cresswell et al. 10 in their work on the learning object-centred models system. Automated planning has also been investigated by Fernandez et al. 11 who propose an architecture for the automation of data mining tasks. Again the Planning Domain Definition language features heavily in this approach. The papers included in this section so far, while not currently applied to rail uses, do hold some potential for further investigation with regards to autonomous rail research. There are only limited investigations into full autonomous operation within the railway industry, usually concentrating on automatic operation of metro/light rail systems as in Dominguez et al. 12 and Wackrow and Slamen. 13 Opportunities exist to review maintenance planning and scheduling, among other activities, with a view to autonomous or semi-autonomous operation.\nData mining\nThe area of data mining has increased in importance in-line with the increasing ability for information systems to capture and preserve data. In tandem with this is the maturing of computational intelligence techniques used for the identification of patterns in the collected data (Witten and Frank 14 ). The rail industry is both a producer of data and a user of the knowledge extracted from such data sets.\nThe work of Goverde and Meng 15 utilises train describer records (describer records contain operational information about the track and train movements) to improve the performance of infrastructure and train services. This paper outlines tools for the mining of train describer data, and its analysis, for the purpose of increasing capacity, punctuality and reliability while improving safety. Of interest in this area is the mining of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data. SCADA systems are employed in a range of industrial scenarios including rail (Hadžiosmanovic et al. 16 ). The work of Hadžiosmanovic et al. 16 mines SCADA data in a workflow-centric manner with regard to the identification of anomalous log traces that could indicate incorrect use of the system or a potential security breach.\nThe mining of rail data in the form of business processes is explored by Kecman and Goverde. 17 Train describer event data is mined by a process mining tool to provide a more informed analysis of potential train path conflicts (to minimise disruptions to trains in the network and improve safety). Business process mining aims to rediscover a process from event log data (recorded executions of business processes) typically drawn from enterprise software systems. The practice of business process mining is further described in Van der Aalst and Weijters 18 and a range of techniques are referenced in Tiwari et al. 19\nKnowledge engineering frameworks and ontology\nKnowledge engineering concerns the practice of designing and building knowledge-based systems. In the opinion of Studer et al. 20 the practice of knowledge engineering (KE) should adopt formal structured approaches inherent in a discipline such as software engineering. In essence KE has, since the work of Studer et al., 20 become a discipline that has its own set of frameworks and methodological approach. Studer et al. 20 mentions three frameworks for knowledge engineering: CommonKADS, MIKE and PROTEGE-II.\nA critical component of KE is the use of semantic technologies utilising XML meta-descriptions of objects and ontologies, enabling an enhanced level of contextual meaning to be expressed through knowledge systems. Ontologies, in particular, have had a significant role to play in semantic web technologies and in the use of computational intelligence techniques in KE. Ontologies can be thought of as a type of dictionary that links together corresponding words in different vocabularies, allowing document creators to know how best to describe their documents. As Antoniou and van Harmelen 21 put it ‘an ontology consists of a finite list of terms and the relationships between these terms’. This can make such documents, at least partially, machine understandable with the application of artificial intelligence algorithms.\nThe case for the use of ontologies in rail industry applications is made by Easton et al.; 22 in that the proliferation of legacy systems in the industry together with the range of alternative terms used by different parties to refer to the same entity make ontology use highly desirable. An example use of ontologies in the rail industry is given by Briola et al. 23 These authors utilise ontologies, along with natural language processing, to manage traffic control within a railway network (using representative test data sets). Work by Zarri et al. 24 examines the generation of business rules from a semantic knowledge system for use in the checking of hazardous materials being transported by rail. In this work the ontological approach aids the development and structuring of If/Then rules concerning the checking of hazardous materials transported in rail wagons.\nSemantic technologies\nSemantic technologies rely on ontologies for their definition and context. Semantic languages often employ XML as a framework due to its ability to provide a structured meta-description for combination with or attachment to another digital object. Bousse et al. 25 extend one such semantic language, SysML (systems modeling language), for use with rail safety systems. The case study described by Bousse et al. 25 concerns a railway crossing controller made up of a set of sensors fitted to a level crossing. The SysML specification is modified with suitable additions to describe the correct monitoring and functioning of the crossing. The modelling of such safety control systems in the rail industry may be carried out in a language such as UML. Berkenkötter and Hannemann 26 outline an approach utilising UML 2.0 for such a task, utilising semantic descriptions. The use of such a modelling paradigm with a semantic XML description could provide a powerful tool for the exploration, verification and enforcement of a control system. Network Rail have also been investigating the use of the IEC 61850 standard used by the electrical supply industry in their use of XML coding as a communication interface between power supply systems and controllers (Burnham 27 ) with the aim of being able to remotely monitor the condition of suitably equipped power supply systems within the network.\nSemantic process mining is another recent extension of an existing technique with ontological and semantic capabilities. Jareevongpiboon and Janecek 28 concentrate on the direct addition of semantics to business processes. With this technique business process event logs are annotated with ontologically defined concept descriptions. A number of ontological resources are utilised for the annotation: a domain ontology (for the domain concerning the business processes); company ontology (containing company-specific definitions) and definitions from relevant databases (Jareevongpiboon and Janecek). 28\nSemantic technologies provide a new method of data description for potential use in the rail industry. Many data interchange standards still exist in the rail networks of Europe and semantics provide the potential for providing a harmonised way of exchanging information between different systems; a useful requirement, considering the range of technologies being introduced in both rail vehicles and trackside, when considering their intelligent control.\nExpert and decision support systems\nExpert systems within the rail industry can take many forms and may be used to address a number of areas. Saa et al. 29 outline an ontology-driven expert decision support system for the design of railway electrification systems. This approach is based on the development of a knowledge database composed of expert views and used to inform the design process. The intended automation of the collection and use of expert views will be facilitated though the further development and use of a rules engine. Such systems may also be autonomous in their operation, and are often employed in the task of monitoring assets. Palte 30 makes the point that remote vehicle monitoring systems, for rail vehicles, must be capable of communicating their collected data and analysis in an informative and appropriate way to interested parties; Palte 30 presents a commentary of a number of salient factors for designers of such monitoring systems to take into account. Zhang 31 puts forward a framework for the monitoring of maintenance, repair and operation (MRO) activities regarding high-speed trains. This approach, based on the use of radio frequency identification sensors, utilises complex event processing and semantics to evaluate the efficiency of MRO activities. Condition monitoring of rail vehicles is also the subject of the work of Firlik et al. 32 who examine light rail systems from this perspective. This paper examines the dynamic adjustment of maintenance needs and track speed limits based on sensor readings from axle boxes. Such autonomous functionality is still new in the rail industry, with only the most recent papers giving serious attention to it.\nIntelligent decision support systems are now becoming a reality in the rail industry. Ngigi et al. 33 detail the progress in predictive control methods and their relevance to condition monitoring activities related to rail. Such systems can be used to support decisions on when to perform maintenance and renewals tasks. In particular a class of algorithms known as model predictive control (MPC) attempt to optimise future behaviour of assets by computing a sequence of modified actions. One such control method is the Kalman filter, which has been utilised in the assessment of the dynamic performance of rail vehicle components while in motion. In addition wheelset condition monitoring (WCM) systems are now used to assess a range of wheel-related degradation instances and include systems such as: wheel impact detectors, hot axle bearing detection, brake pad inspection systems and automatic vehicle identification systems. The authors acknowledge that the combination of WCM and simulation techniques is required for high-performance real-time condition monitoring of rail vehicles and the support of maintenance decisions.\nOne interesting development, with possible application to safety uses in the rail industry, is the introduction of the European GALILEO satellite navigation system. This system will potentially be a rival for the global positioning system (GPS) and, unlike standard GPS, will in time be certified for use in railway safety applications (Beugin et al. 34 ). The work of Beugin et al. 34 envisages a time when all trains will be fitted with intelligent communication systems capable of transmitting their real-time position and health to control centres. Safety-critical situations, such as velocity of a train in speed-restricted sections of lines and location of a train within signalling blocks, are potential application areas for real-time location technology (Beugin et al. 34 ).\nPlanning and scheduling applied to rail research subject areas\nSection:\nTimetable planning\nTimetable planning is an active area of research for the rail industry. The work of Yang et al. 35 investigates the development of incomplete cyclic timetables for trains. Real-time re-scheduling of trains is the subject of Wegele et al., 36 where genetic algorithms are used to perform a heuristic re-ordering of trains when delays are encountered in the rail network. The mark-up language RailML is also mentioned in this work. RailML is a metadata language, utilising XML, which defines a set of common rail-specific terminology as meta descriptions. RailML is only mentioned in a few papers at present (RailML is detailed in Nash et al. 37 ). The practice behind train dispatching is outlined by Kuckelberg and Wendler 38 who aim to address the conflicts that arise when trains block each other due to delays. These authors provide an algorithmic software tool incorporating a strategy building approach to conflict resolution and a system framework.\nThe timetabling problem is framed by Ho et al., 39 as one of multi-objective optimisation in that a feasible solution must be identified within a limited time constraint that satisfies a number of objectives. Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is used to design a timetable for a railway network that operates as an open market (an open market network usually consists of an infrastructure provider and a number of competing train operating companies). In PSO optimisation each particle in a swarm represents a potential solution to an optimisation problem through its location within the swarm (Ho et al. 39 ). The optimisation of timetables has also been addressed by Forsgren et al. 40 who provide an optimisation tool that is also capable of conflict resolution. In this approach, existing timetables are fed in and then optimised while still allowing timetable planners to make their own adjustments. Albrecht et al. 41 take an approach to timetable revision that involves the use of a problem space search heuristic to generate alternative solutions. This approach is particularly relevant to re-scheduling situations due to track and infrastructure maintenance needs. The simulation of rail systems to aid planning and timetable design has been investigated by Besinovic et al. 42 who aim to determine real train running time and speed profiles. In the work of Pellegrini et al., 43 who propose a simulation model utilising mixed-integer linear programming, the area of train routing and scheduling for complex rail junctions is explored. This research aims to achieve optimised routing for trains in the event of unexpected disruptions to track availability. Different levels of granularity (locking of routes and of just track sections) were considered. The locking of track sections involved in the finer granularity gave higher-quality solutions (shorter delays). In future work the authors aim to use the model in a rolling-horizon framework. The mixed integer linear programing construct is also deployed in a simulation by Rudan et al. 44 who investigate the area of dynamic railway scheduling. A number of constraints are considered in this work describing the normal scheduled operation of trains, including time taken at junctions, dwell time at stations and timetabled journey commencement. On average a 30% reduction in delays can be achieved using this approach. Another advantage of this approach is its ability to highlight the most delay-prone trains in the network. Additional work in this area includes Ruan et al. 45 who utilise a genetic algorithm approach to determine the parameters that should be examined by a rail system simulation, in terms of safety-critical operation.\nA salient point is made by Crevier et al. 46 in that the financially viable operation of rail networks normally involves the inclusion of freight services and that such services can present scheduling challenges. The combination of network scheduling and pricing is considered in this work with a mixed-integer approach presented and the consideration of two pricing policies, disjoint (separate prices are given for each itinerary) and common (where a common tariff is used for all itineraries). From this research, it was found that a disjoint pricing policy provided more revenue, with future work concentrating on the ability of the customer to select a tariff. This research is one of the few works to consider profitable freight pricing with scheduling.\nThe area of rail yards is in part the subject of Marinov et al. 47 who examine the use of simulation software to model rail timetable and network management decisions. This paper describes common yard types and approaches to modelling common factors such as wagon speeds, section lengths and train manoeuvring parameters. The further work of Marinov and Viegas 48 examines the simulation of rail freight by examining the rail network as a set of entities (such as yards, stations, lines) and looks at the queuing situations at each entity.\nScheduling of trains in terms of energy-efficiency goals is another active area of interest and one such approach is described in the work of Hu et al. 5 This approach utilises a combination of a standard multi-objective optimisation algorithm and a fuzzy multi-objective optimisation approach to find train allocations and movements that balance fuel efficiency with passenger travel time. Timetable and planning robustness related to the movement of long-haul trains is the subject of the work of Pudney et al. 49 who utilise a Monte Carlo approach to locomotive movements in the Australian rail network.\nTrain control systems\nOne of the major developments in train control systems in recent years has been the European rail traffic management system (ERTMS). The ERTMS system is composed of two main entities, the European train control system (ETCS) and global system for mobile communications-railway (GSM-R) (Abed 50 ). ETCS is comprised of two main components, the automatic train protection system (automated emergency braking at red signals) and signalling system (in-cab signalling). GSM-R is an international standard for mobile voice and data communication transmission in a railway environment and primarily used for train to control centre communication. The different levels of ERTMS are detailed in Abed. 50\nAn interesting paper in the area of certification of ERTMS systems for installation in European rail networks has been produced by Jabri et al. 51 This paper puts forward a method based on a combination of UML (Unified Modelling Language) and Petri nets for this purpose.\nAlternative train control systems are being developed outside of Europe. In Baba et al. 52 the advanced train administration and communications system is outlined. This system, developed by Hitachi and the East Japan Railway Company, operates in a similar way to ERTMS and corresponds to level 3 of the European system (Baba et al. 52 ).\nEnergy conservation is another recent topic for research within the field of train control systems. According to Xun et al. 53 there are four types of energy saving actions that can take place within train operation.\nEnergy efficient train driving style.\nCoordination of trains in real-time.\nTimetabling for energy efficiency.\nInclusion of energy efficiency goals in planning activities.\nXun et al. 53 point to the use of re-generative breaking to contribute to energy savings and define two types of control for this mode; train dwell time and train running time (these two types are discussed in more detail in Wong and Ho 54 ). Xun et al. 53 stress the importance of fully automated operation of trains running within such an energy-efficient system. Further work by Park et al. 55 examines the prediction of energy consumption related to the driving of electric trains in the Korean rail network through the utilisation of simulation techniques. An optimal train driving strategy is also put forward by Bocharnikov et al. 56 who examine this area in relation to electrically powered suburban railways. This technique utilises a genetic algorithm to identify optimal train trajectories from a set of simulations. In addition energy-efficient driving of trains is the subject of the work of Ke et al. 57 who look at this subject in relation to rapid transit systems with the aim of optimising speed of service with the need for reduced energy consumption.\nThe modelling and verification of control systems for high-speed trains is a necessary step in the assurance of the safe operation of modern rail lines. Lv et al. 58 put forward such a model capable of describing hybrid systems that compose most modern high-speed train control systems. Train protection systems and the problem of train over-speed has been the subject of research by Guo et al. 59 In this work the authors describe the simulation of a train protection system with the aim of reducing the development time of a working real life system.\nAlthough this area is dominated by ERTMS and ETCS, it should be noted that additional systems are also relevant in the delivery of safe and efficient train control, such as those involved in efficient driving strategies for rail vehicles.\nRailway infrastructure\nIncreasingly the rail industry is looking to autonomous and intelligent systems to address the maintenance needs of its infrastructure. According to Dadashi et al. 59 this introduction of intelligent infrastructure has been brought about by the need to move from reactive to diagnostic and prognostic modes of railway maintenance where faults are predicted and potentially designed out of the system (Dadashi et al. 60 ). Three main uses of intelligent infrastructure have been highlighted by Dadashi et al.: 60\ndata acquisition: to obtain data from fixed assets such as signals, bridges and points;\nhealth assessment: to ascertain the health status of the aforementioned fixed assets;\nadvisory notification: to deliver diagnostic and prognostic information to operators and add to a decision support knowledge base.\nFurther to these definitions Dadashi et al. 60 provides an outline data processing framework for intelligent railway infrastructure. Rail inspection is a substantive topic for research; Popović et al. 61 gives a comprehensive overview of the subject with regard to common rail defects. Rail maintenance is also the subject of Bouillaut et al. 62 who provide an approach and a decision support tool for the reliability maintenance of underground rail tracks. The approach taken in this work is to utilise a Bayesian network for the modelling of maintenance strategies to detect and prevent broken rails. In addition the work of Guler 63 describes a decision support system for railway track maintenance and renewal programmes, which is comprised of rules developed from interviews with track experts and secondary research sources. Nystrom and Soderholm 64 present a method for the prioritisation of railway maintenance actions. Zhao et al. 65 also examine scheduling activities in the form of synchronised rail track component renewal. In this work they utilise a genetic algorithm approach to optimise track renewal activities; thus, minimising the cost incurred and track possession time.\nThe automated inspection of rail track is the subject of the work of Li et al. 66 who present a method to detect track components using a computer-vision-based system. In addition GPS data along with a distance measurement instrument are used to improve the accuracy of track components detection. Rail ties and anchors are vital components in the attachment of rails to track. These components must be in a good maintenance condition and have the correct spacing to make the track safe. The system can achieve up to 99% accuracy in the identification of rail ties. Future work includes the use of a modified imaging system and improved track illumination in order to reduce the number of false-positive readings recorded. Another example of automated track inspection is given by Resendiz et al. 67 who have developed an algorithm that can identify periodically occurring track components. Signal processing and a spectral estimation technique are used in the development of the technique. The MUSIC (multiple signal classification) technique was selected in this research due to its ability to detect multiple repeating instances in data streams containing noise. Future work aims to develop the system to a level of accuracy where it can operate autonomously.\nA major safety concern for rail networks is the stability of the track. In the work of Ahmad et al. 68 a track stability management tool is developed for the assessment of temperature and amount of track deformation. A margin of safety, along with a range of allowable temperature tolerances for tracks, has been calculated in this work that allows for decisions to be made on when maintenance teams are to be sent out on inspections and when the setting of speed limits in hot weather is appropriate.\nTrack geometry inspection technology is the subject of the work of Li et al. 69 who propose a neural network technique to recognise complex patterns between track geometry and vehicle response. Their performance-based track geometry inspection system relates track geometry and vehicle speed to actual vehicle performance in real-time. This system has been tested against historical data of past derailments and vehicle performance issues related to track geometry.\nOne novel development for rail maintenance is the use of handheld computers to display rail-specific special information such as track layouts (Dadashi et al. 70 ). Such a system could be used to highlight danger areas and prominent landmarks to line workers who do not have local knowledge of a particular work site. Dadashi et al. 70 put forward the point that electronic layouts are more practical than paper-based ones for night working and working in bad weather conditions.\nSignalling systems\nBeyond the area of train control systems, such as ETCS, considerable research has been carried out in the area of signalling and its analysis for safety-related purposes. The work of Filip et al. 71 examines the use of global navigation satellite systems (GNNS) in relation to railway safety applications. In this study the authors examine the applicability of existing GNSS technologies and their modes for use in the railway industry, highlighting their current limitations. As Filip et al. 72 mentions satellite technology will have a significant impact on the railways, in that the trackside sensor equipment (such as Balaises and hot box sensors) will be superseded by asset-located sensors that determine the actual real-time position via satellite. Filip et al. 72 go on to mention the European Galileo satellite system currently under development and its applicability to railway signalling.\nAs mentioned already railway signalling research has been conducted involving areas such as satellite technology 71 , 72 though there has also been an investigation into the use of Internet protocol for the control of signals reducing the need for the installation of traditional copper wiring (Endo et al. 73 ). The general trend in signalling research is that the real-time location and monitoring of rail asset condition as data inputs to signalling systems is now on the near horizon; though knowledge of the impact on planning and scheduling activities brought about by this new paradigm is not as well-developed. One of the more relevant works in this direction is that of Lai and Wang 74 who address capacity planning from the perspective of new signalling systems and track layout designs. A paper of particular interest as a primer for further planning and scheduling research is that of Dicembre and Ricci 75 who investigate the effect of factors such as signalling and capacity on high-density urban rail corridors. In summary, in the European rail sector, although ETCS (in-train cab signal system) is seen as the future for many main lines it is likely that for cost, and in some cases logistical reasons, traditional track side signalling equipment will remain in branch lines for many decades. This necessitates the need for ongoing maintenance and renewal of such track side assets.\nMaintenance\nAs mentioned by Dadashi et al. 60 there has been a move from reactive to diagnostic and prognostic modes of railway maintenance; where fault diagnosis and prediction are key. As part of this movement work has been conducted into the area of fault states and the interdependencies between the states in Schöbel and Maly. 76 This paper makes clear the need for active monitoring of rail vehicles so logical connections between fault states can be made and acted upon in a timely manner.\nAs in the work of Dadashi et al. 70 (discussed in the infrastructure section) data from assets deployed in the field can increasingly be made available to mobile devices. Bye 77 details the use of mobile devices and the design of application interfaces with case studies drawn from the UK infrastructure provider Network Rail.\nThe subject of risk-centred maintenance is investigated by Selvik and Aven. 78 These authors make the point that reliability-centred maintenance for preventative maintenance practice is well understood in industry, though it does present limitations when used to quantify risk and uncertainty in projects. In order to address this limitation the authors introduce the reliability and risk-centred maintenance framework that provides a methodology for the communication and quantification of risk in maintenance practice. In general a good review of scheduling techniques for preventative maintenance is provided by Soh et al. 79\nThe importance of organisational design in railway maintenance operations is highlighted by Jiang et al. 80 Maintenance operations may be performed by a collection of co-operating organisations, having a model of how such organisations operate together is, in the opinion of Jiang et al. 80 essential. Jiang et al. 80 put forward the OperA + framework, which is an agent-based framework allowing for the creation of dynamic representations of organisational interaction. Such an agent-based approach is said, by Jiang et al. 80 to provide a more accurate model of both real life and future organisation interaction scenarios.\nThe scheduling of rail maintenance teams is the subject of the work of Peng et al. 81 where a time–space network is proposed to optimise the assignment of workers. A number of constraints, drawn from industry practice, are proposed in this work, such as: time windows, travel costs, and parallel execution of projects. Local search algorithms are utilised to solve sub-divisions of the problem space. The work has been applied to a railroad network and has outperformed industry standard manual practices. In future work the authors propose the inclusion of further constraints reflecting latest practice in the rail industry.\nIn Peng et al. 82 the optimal routing and scheduling of periodic inspections in a rail network are explored in the context of long-term planning. A heuristic algorithm is put forward as part of this research that utilises a local search method, thereby allowing for the scheduling problem to be divided into sub sets, as in similar work by Peng and Ouyang. 83 Improved results are found over existing manual techniques, although this approach is only able to add new tasks at the end of the schedule rather than within the schedule.\nSchlake et al. 84 makes the point that wayside monitoring of railcars is essential for the enablement of predictive maintenance practice. This research looked at the economic impact of train delays and the effect of introducing lean production methods on mainline railway operations to improve railcar inspection processes facilitated by monitoring equipment. The cost savings provided by improved maintenance practices were estimated by this study at over $15,000,000 a year.\nThe work of Hajibabai et al. 85 focuses on the mining of data collected from rail carriages utilising wheel impact load detectors and wheel profile detectors. A regression analysis was performed to predict with 90% efficiency high impact wheel train stops within a 30 day period.\nIncreasingly industry is looking towards the provision of support service packages to complement the products that they sell. This product service system approach (which is expanded on in Baines et al. 86 ) involves manufacturers having to calculate the cost of maintaining products over set periods of time. Dersin and Valenzuela 87 describe the use of Petri nets to model the maintenance costs inherent in a rail system. The Petri net models are used in conjunction with a policy planning tool to simulate the processes required for different maintenance policies.\nThe area of semantics and their use in maintenance practice is the research subject of Matsokis et al. 88 A great deal of maintenance-related data held on assets is not described and recorded in any uniform way at present; the work of Matsokis et al. 88 aims to address this issue by providing an ontology model for maintenance practice. Although the authors have not expressly based their work in the rail industry, the applicability of their methodology is implied.\nOpportunities with semantic technology\nSection:\nAs mentioned earlier, the value of knowledge-based systems in the rail industry is rapidly increasing. The use of ontologies and semantic technology increases the potential usefulness of data stores and legacy data repositories. The ability to draw meaning from data in a context-relevant fashion is becoming a new research focus in the industry and is of direct relevance for the development of autonomous systems for rail.\nThe mining of text resources for knowledge has received considerable attention in recent years. In particular, the area of web mining has become popular with organisations using data mining techniques to identify solutions to problems from web-based materials. One such approach is put forward by Thorleuchter and van den Poel 89 who investigate the use of web mining to discover new technological developments based on optimised parameter values. Such a technique could be valuable in the rail industry for the identification of potential solutions from proprietary data sources. Due to the array of potential data sources in the rail industry a web mining approach may allow for unified access to these sources.\nWeb mining is of great relevance to the rail industry as both web and rail industry sources of information may possess varying degrees of structure. Web mining largely involves the mining of unstructured context-rich information from a variety of text-based sources (Cambria et al. 90 ). The mining of personal opinions is one such target of web mining techniques. Cambria et al. 90 explore the subject of sentiment analysis, in which the meaning of personal opinions on social blogs and other sources are sought, using a combination of data mining and other computational techniques.\nIn similar work Mostafa 91 uses text mining coupled with a Lexicon (dictionary) containing words with known sentiment descriptions to mine consumer sentiments about brands recorded in social blogs. Cruz et al. 92 also explore the area of opinion mining using a domain-oriented approach. In their approach Cruz et al. 92 opinions are extracted from user-generated product reviews. The authors find that domain-oriented approaches produce more accurate opinion extraction systems; their approach also utilises a method to determine the polarity and strength of the polarity of reviews. The work of Robaldo and Di Caro 93 is notable here as they provide an XML mark-up language for use in opinion mining called OpinionMining-ML.\nA final example of the use of ontologies in the management of rail systems is provided by Briola et al. 23 who present a semantic architecture for the centralised control of railway traffic. One of the main advantages of this system is the ability for a user to make natural language queries on the data being collected. Two key objectives of this approach are to reduce the overall cost of managing the rail system through autonomous or semi-autonomous operation and the ability to make real-time changes to train movements and their scheduling when encountering problems that may lead to service disruption such as faulty trains and damage within the infrastructure (Briola et al. 23 ).\nAn Analysis of Planning and Scheduling Papers\nSection:\nAlthough the papers reviewed in this paper have been assigned to particular headings based on their central concept many benefit from more than one approach. Table 1 shows a number of opportunities for the use of different technologies within rail industry planning and scheduling activities. From Table 1 it was possible to construct a pie chart of the literature review papers relating to planning and scheduling activities within the rail industry based on the technologies that they utilised. Figure 2 demonstrates that 58% of the papers feature expert and decision support systems, with 14% utilising semantic technologies. From this analysis it can also be seen that more recent papers are now referring to autonomous applications, though they are mainly restricted to applications such as the automatic or semi-automatic operation of metro systems.\n""","1.0","""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0954409714565654""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

Road vehicles account for almost half of the energy used in all transport modes globally. Reducing energy use in vehicles is key to meeting the forecast increase in demand for transport, while improving energy security and mitigating climate change. Non-powertrain vehicle options may reduce fuel consumption by at least 15%. Electric motors are the significant powertrain option to reduce energy use in vehicles because they are more efficient than the internal combustion engine and can recover a portion of the vehicle kinetic energy during braking. Conventionally, batteries are used to meet both the power and energy demands of electric vehicles and their variants. However, batteries are well-suited to store energy, while ultra-capacitors and high-speed flywheels are better placed to meet the bidirectional, high power requirements of real-world driving. Combining technologies with complementary strengths can yield a lower cost and more efficient energy storage system. While pure and hybrid electric vehicles use less energy than internal combustion engine vehicles, their ability to mitigate climate change is a function of the emissions intensity of the processes used to generate their electricity.\nItem Type:\n""","0.023545956","""http://publications.eng.cam.ac.uk/681604/""",

However, the model based on the electrochemical reactions within the batteries is highly complex and difficult to compute using conventional approaches. Radial basis function (RBF) neural networks have been widely used to model complex systems for estimation and control purpose, while the optimization of both the linear and non-linear parameters in the RBF model remains a key issue.

It is located roughly equidistant between the three Midlands' cities of Derby, Leicester and Nottingham and currently supports a range of full-service scheduled, charter and low-cost passenger operations to short- and medium-haul destinations in Europe as well as a significant number of long-haul intra and intercontinental freight services. In 2012, EMA was the thirteenth busiest passenger airport in the UK, handling just over four million customers a year, and the country's largest pure freight facility, processing almost 300 000 t of cargo and mail. By examining the historical development and commercial evolution of EMA from its opening as a commercial airport in 1965 to the present day, the paper details how a combination of far-sighted planning decisions and strategic management interventions have enabled EMA to diversify its operations and develop a unique operating niche that serves passenger flights during the day and cargo operations at night. The paper concludes by identifying elements of best practice and examining the extent to which the development of successful cargo operations at EMA could serve as a model for other regional airports worldwide that are seeking to develop complementary passenger and freight services.\nKeywords:\n""","1.0","""https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/10.1680/tran.13.00075""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

We outline a paradigm designed for comparison of different models, which we refer to as spike train prediction. A key ingredient of this paradigm is a prediction quality valuation that estimates how close a predicted conditional intensity function is to an actual observed spike train. Although a valuation based on log likelihood (L) is most natural, it has various complications in this context. We propose that a quadratic valuation (Q) can be used as an alternative to L. Q shares some important theoretical properties with L, including consistency, and the two valuations perform similarly on simulated and experimental data. Moreover, Q is more robust than L, and optimization with Q can dramatically improve computational efficiency. We illustrate the utility of Q for comparing models of peer prediction, where it can be computed directly from cross-correlograms. Although Q does not have a straightforward probabilistic interpretation, Q is essentially given by Euclidean distance. © 2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nPublication data is maintained in RPS.

It is located roughly equidistant between the three Midlands' cities of Derby, Leicester and Nottingham and currently supports a range of full-service scheduled, charter and low-cost passenger operations to short- and medium-haul destinations in Europe as well as a significant number of long-haul intra and intercontinental freight services. In 2012, EMA was the thirteenth busiest passenger airport in the UK, handling just over four million customers a year, and the country's largest pure freight facility, processing almost 300 000 t of cargo and mail. By examining the historical development and commercial evolution of EMA from its opening as a commercial airport in 1965 to the present day, the paper details how a combination of far-sighted planning decisions and strategic management interventions have enabled EMA to diversify its operations and develop a unique operating niche that serves passenger flights during the day and cargo operations at night. The paper concludes by identifying elements of best practice and examining the extent to which the development of successful cargo operations at EMA could serve as a model for other regional airports worldwide that are seeking to develop complementary passenger and freight services.\nKeywords:\n""","0.028544813","""https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/10.1680/tran.13.00075""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

Such disturbances always occur, but their amplitudes are usually small. For the particular case of high-speed trains, they can reach levels that would cause annoyance in the absence of suitable countermeasures. This risk is especially large in the case of long tunnels. The general behaviour of wave reflection/transmission/radiation at a perforated exit region has been explored in previous papers that have (a) quantified the dependence on the characteristics of the incident wavefront reaching the exit region from further upstream in the tunnel and (b) validated the numerical methodology in a searching manner. Some notable differences have been found in comparison with the criteria that have long been known for unperforated exit regions. In particular, the resulting MPW amplitudes depend on the amplitudes of incident wavefronts as well as on their steepnesses. This paper summarises these outcomes and uses the methodology to explore important practical design issues, namely the dependence of the effectiveness of perforated exit regions on their length and cross-sectional area. Once again, differences are found from the behaviour of unperforated regions.\nKeywords:\n""","1.0","""http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/10.1680/jencm.15.00026""","[-2.099122,57.165019]"
"""UCL""","""Iris Publication""","""http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1557223/\nAbstract\nThis paper proposes that there has been an evolving pattern of urban transport policy and planning in many Western cities, which has been associated with changes in mobility patterns and attitudes to different transport modes and to city living in general. Looking over the past 50 year period, a three-stage transport policy development cycle is proposed, starting with Stage 1 – a rapid increase in car ownership and use in Western cities from the 1950s, often associated with the growth of a domestic car industry. This led to a policy response that involved catering for vehicle use by building urban motorways and large car parks, reducing investment in public transport and with more negative attitudes towards cycling and walking. After some time the negative aggregate consequences of increasing car use and provision become widely apparent, through increasing congestion, air pollution, traffic accidents, etc. Now the policy priority switches in Stage 2 - from accommodating motor vehicles to providing for people movement, particularly through improvements to public transport. Beijing has recently made this transition, with a 5 year programme to build 550 km of new metro lines, instead of further increasing road capacity. Several cities (e.g. London and Copenhagen) have moved beyond this to a Stage 3 in which the priority is to provide a liveable city with a focus on activity and interaction, in which car traffic is reduced, some elevated roads are demolished and roadspace is reallocated to sustainable modes of transport and to provide enhanced public space. Finally, the paper considers whether developing cities that are in Stage 1 and experiencing rapid motorisation could learn from this evolutionary model: 1. By ensuring that they do not promote land use polices which may lead to a ‘lock-in’ that prevents evolution beyond a car-based city, and 2. By compressing the development cycle – speeding up the implementation of more sustainable transport policies and avoiding wasted investment in roads-based infrastructure.\nPublication data is maintained in RPS.

In this paper we attempt to estimate the flow rate capacity of an overturned rail carriage end exit. This was achieved through two full-scale evacuation experiments, in one of which the participants were subjected to non-toxic smoke. The experiments were conducted as part of a pilot study into evacuation from rail carriages. In reviewing the experimental results, it should be noted that only a single run of each trial was undertaken with a limited — though varied — population. As a result it is not possible to test the statistical significance of the evacuation times quoted and so the results should be treated as indicative rather than definitive. The carriage used in the experiments was a standard class Mark IID which, while an old carriage design, shares many features with those carriages commonly found on the British rail network. In the evacuation involving smoke, the carriage end exit was found to achieve an average flow rate capacity of approximately 5.0 persons/min. The average flow rate capacity of the exit without smoke was found to be approximately 9.2 persons/min. It was noted that the presence of smoke tended to reduce significantly the exit flow rate. Due to the nature of the experimental conditions, these flow rates are considered optimistic. Finally, the authors make several recommendations for improving survivability in rail accidents.

A consideration of the issues associated with the introduction of emission control areas\nPDF\nAbstract\nThis paper draws upon original research undertaken in the United Kingdom and Sweden. It considers the enforcement of regulations associated with the limitation of air emissions from shipping. Specifically, it considers the enforcement of regulations pertaining to the Baltic and North Sea emission control areas (ECAs). The paper outlines the steps that have been taken to ensure vessel compliance in these ECAs. It describes the effectiveness of such enforcement as well as current limitations and gives specific emphasis to the views of vessel operators. The paper ends with a series of recommendations that have been arrived at following discussion of the research findings with a select group of industry experts.\nKeywords: regulation ,  globalisation ,  ports ,  pollution ,  environment ,  emissions\nBackground\nThe latter half of the twentieth century saw increased interest amongst academics in the problem of the environment, not least how to reconcile economic, social and environmental interests (Dobson 1996 Dobson, A. 1996. “The Green Scene: Academics on the Environment.” Sociology 30 (2): 395–403. doi:10.1177/0038038596030002013. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] , 395). Within the maritime field concern with pollution, and the potential for shipping business to negatively impact on the marine environment and related biodiversity, has also grown. Marine pollution in the form of oil and chemical spills has attracted much media attention in the last 30 years as high profile incidents taking place in European waters (e.g. oil spills from the Sea Empress, Braer, Erika and Prestige) or particularly sensitive environments (e.g. Exxon Valdez) have hit the headlines. It has also attracted the attention of academics concerned to offer insight into risk mitigation and the role of regulation and of good governance in mitigating such impacts. For example, Radović et al. ( 2012 Radović, J., D. Rial, B. Lyons, C. Harman, L. Viñas, R. Beiras, J. Readman, K. Thomas, and J. Bayona. 2012. “Post-Incident Monitoring to Evaluate Environmental Damage from Shipping Incidents: Chemical and Biological Assessments.” Journal of Environmental Management 109 (Oct): 136–153. doi:10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.04.042. [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) offer an analysis of the best strategies for the detection and assessment of oil and chemical spills arising from shipping incidents in support of more effective damage limitation, whereas Xu ( 2009 Xu, J. 2009. “‘The Law and Economics of Pollution Damage Arising from Carriage of Oil by Sea.” Maritime Policy & Management 36 (4): 309–323. doi:10.1080/03088830903056942. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) offers an analysis of liability in the event of pollution damage at sea. In the face of increased public and policy concerns, the shipping industry has sought actively to curtail the negative environmental externalities arising within the shipping sector, in particular that of marine pollution. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has dedicated annex VI of the MARPOL convention to regulations concerned with the limitation of air pollution including, but not exclusively, CO2 emissions. Regulation 14 is specifically concerned with the regulation of sulphur dioxide (SOx) and particulate matter, and in 2006, 2007, and 2012, emission control areas (ECAs) restricting the emission of SOx were established in the Baltic, North Sea, and North American zones, respectively. While the pollution restrictions that were initially established by MARPOL were originally considered to be ineffective with regard to environmental impact by some commentators (Ringbom 1999 Ringbom, H. 1999. “Preventing Pollution from Ships – Reflections on the ‘Adequacy’ of Existing Rules.” Reciel 8 (1): 21–28.  [Google Scholar] ) plans to restrict sulphur levels to 0.1% by 2015 in ECAs are thought by some to represent a ‘step change’ in practice.\nThese developments have been followed with some interest in the trade and wider press and they have continued to remain central to the news agenda (see for recent examples Green 2011 Green, R. 2011. “In the Greening of Our Seas Speed Is of the Essence.” Asian Conversations. Accessed February 18. http://www.asianconversations.com/GreenShipping.php   [Google Scholar] ; Eilperin 2012 Eilperin, J.

They have also provided the focus for research in the academic community of a largely business oriented/technical nature. For example, Eide et al. have considered the cost-effectiveness of different measures which act to reduce CO2 emissions. They conclude that according to the criteria they establish, ‘several measures are cost effective’ (Eide et al. 2009 Eide, M., Ø. Endresen, R. Skjong, T. Longva, and S. Alvik. 2009. “Cost-Effectiveness Assessment of CO2 Reducing Measures in Shipping.” Maritime Policy & Management 36 (4): 367–384. doi:10.1080/03088830903057031. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 381), depending on the price of fuel, but that at the time of publication these excluded the use of solar panels, fuel cells and waste heat recovery due to the initial high investment costs associated with such technologies. In a similar vein, Longva and colleagues have considered energy efficiency design indexes (EEDI) and the establishment of associated targets (Longva, Eide, and Skjong 2010 Longva, T., M. Eide, and R. Skjong. 2010. “Determining a Required Energy Efficiency Design Index Level for New Ships Based on a Cost-Effectiveness Criterion.” Maritime Policy & Management 37 (2): 129–143. doi:10.1080/03088830903533759. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ); Notteboom ( 2011 Notteboom, T. 2011. “The Impact of Low Sulphur Fuel Requirements in Shipping on the Competitiveness of Roro Shipping in Northern Europe.” WMU Journal of Maritime Affairs 10: 63–95. doi:10.1007/s13437-010-0001-7. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ) has considered the relationship between the use of low-sulphur fuel and competitiveness in the ro-ro sector; and Schinas and Stefanakos ( 2012 Schinas, O., and C. Stefanakos. 2012. “Cost Assessment of Environmental Regulation and Options for Marine Operators.” Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies 25: 81–99. doi:10.1016/j.trc.2012.05.002. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) consider the economic and business implications of sulphur regulations.\nThis paper is written from a rather different perspective. In relation to any maritime regulatory regime, one of the concerns for ship operators is that regulations serve to create a ‘level playing field’ whereby socially responsible operators are not penalised for voluntary compliance with regulation whilst less scrupulous operators establish competitive advantage via regulatory avoidance. It is therefore essential that new regulations relating to the requirement for vessels to use expensive low sulphur fuel in specific ocean zones are effectively enforced. With its strong emphasis on the enforcement of emissions regulation, this paper therefore considers some of the issues that have arisen in conjunction with efforts to control air emissions in the North Sea and Baltic ECAs. It outlines the steps that have been taken to enforce compliance with the requirements of the ECAs and describes the limitations on the effectiveness of such enforcement. The paper further considers the responses of the industry to the introduction of ECAs and highlights the problems that some companies have had in ensuring compliance. It ends with some policy recommendations which have been arrived at following discussion of the research findings with a select group of industry experts (termed a Delphi group).\nThe regulation of deep-sea shipping\nIn the twentieth century, the international shipping industry became increasingly regulated such that by 2013 two main bodies—the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the International Labour Organisation (ILO)—were responsible for formulating the bulk of international regulation pertaining to shipping. Such international regulations were developed in addition to those introduced by specific nation states and regional bodies such as the European Union.\nThe same period witnessed the increased ascendance of the transnational corporation and the phenomenon that is termed globalisation. Globalising processes are described as those that free capital from the confines of national boundaries (Held et al. 1999 Held, D., A. McGrew, D. Goldblatt, and J. Perraton. 1999. Global Transformations: Politics, Economics, and Culture. Cambridge: Polity Press.  [Google Scholar] ) producing ‘footloose’ capital that is free to ‘scour the world’ for cheap sources of labour (Hirst and Thompson 1999 Hirst, P., and G. Thompson. 1999. Glabalisation in Question. 2nd ed. Cambridge: Polity Press.  [Google Scholar] ). In shipping, globalisation can be seen to have taken place with the flagging-out of national fleets to open registers (Sampson 2013 Sampson, H. 2013. International Seafarers and Transnationalism in the Twenty-First Century. Manchester: Manchester University Press.  [Google Scholar] ). As such, by 2012, 57% of the world fleet was registered with the 10 largest open registers (UNCTAD 2012 UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). 2012. Review of Maritime Transport 2012. New York: United Nations Publication. ISBN 978-92-1-112860-4, ISSN 0566-7682.  [Google Scholar] ). Such flagging-out was undertaken in pursuit of competitive advantage (Bergantino and Marlow 1997 Bergantino, A., and P. Marlow. 1997. An Econometric Analysis of the Decision to Flag Out. Cardiff: SIRC.  [Google Scholar] ) achieved as a result of freedom to recruit cheap labour from developing countries and regulatory avoidance (Alderton et al. 2004 Alderton, T., M. Bloor, E. Kahveci, T. Lane, H. Sampson, M. Thomas, N. Winchester, B. Wu, and M. Zhao. 2004. The Global Seafarer: Living and Working Conditions in a Globalised Industry. Geneva: ILO.  [Google Scholar] ).\nAs a result of globalisation, and in spite of the expansion of the regulatory scope of the IMO in particular, the enforcement of international regulations pertaining to shipping has presented considerable challenges to those seeking to retain control over the industry. As ships flagged-out, the traditional means for enforcing regulations relating to shipping, via flag states, was eroded. New open registers were seen to exercise little regulatory control over their fleets (Donaldson 2007 Donaldson, L. (2007) “Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas: Report of Lord Donaldson’s Inquiry into the Prevention of Pollution from Merchant Shipping.” House of Commons Parliamentary Papers Online.  [Google Scholar] ) and a series of shipping disasters with a considerable financial impact on tourism and aquaculture increased political concerns about marine governance and in particular standards pertaining to international vessels. The response by the IMO was to agree mechanisms by which nation states (also termed for this purpose port states) ratifying international regulations were free to enforce related standards in relation to all vessels calling at their ports rather than simply their own fleet of registered vessels. Port state control, as this was termed, came into its own in the latter part of the twentieth century as regional groups of port states began to collaborate with regard to inspection and the targeting of vessels for inspection. For example, the Paris Memorandum of Understanding was established amongst 14 participating states in 1982. It has subsequently grown to include 27 states and has been regarded as particularly effective in establishing higher standards for shipping and something akin to a ‘culture of compliance’ amongst operators whose vessels visit European ports (Bloor et al. 2013c). The website for the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on port state control describes the purpose of port state control as follows:\nPort state control is a check on visiting foreign ships to see that they comply with international rules on safety, pollution prevention and seafarers living and working conditions. It is a means of enforcing compliance where the owner and flag State have failed in their responsibility to implement or ensure compliance. The port State can require defects to be put right, and detain the ship for this purpose if necessary. It is therefore also a port State’s defence against visiting substandard shipping. http://www.parismou.org/organization/about_us/2010.12.28/Principles.htm accessed 28/05/2013\nThis broad regulatory overview provides the backdrop for the research described herein relating to the specific enforcement of pollution controls in European waters in the period 2010–2012. 1 1.  The paper does not focus on regulation of bunker suppliers per se which may be fertile ground for future investigation. This paper is concerned with the broader enforcement of regulations pertaining to ship emissions. View all notes\nMethods\nThe research which underpins this paper was funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council. It was undertaken in the period 2010–2012. The research considered both the North Sea and Baltic ECAs and, as such, fieldwork was focussed in both Sweden and the United Kingdom. In total 50 recorded semi-structured interviews were conducted with port state inspectors, regulators, ship operators and other key industry stakeholders. These augmented the fieldnotes that were made in the course of 16 ship inspections which were observed by researchers at 7 different port state control offices in the United Kingdom and Sweden. In addition, researchers analysed the records of Falmouth bunker deliveries, results of fuel sample tests taken in Sweden and Holland, the records of a large commercial fuel testing company and the results of a company in-house survey relating to the fleet experience of fuel sampling and testing by statutory authorities.\nA slightly different interview schedule was utilised in relation to each group of interviewees (e.g. regulators vs. ship operators) and the overall responses of each group of interviewees were compared with each other augmenting the initial intra-group analysis. Recorded interviews were transcribed and coded. Initial analysis and interpretation was augmented using the established technique of analytic induction (Cressey 1953 Cressey, D. 1953. Other People’s Money: A Study in the Social Psychology of Embezzlement. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.  [Google Scholar] ; Bloor 1978 Bloor, M. 1978. “On the Analysis of Observational Data: A Discussion of the Worth and Uses of Inductive Techniques and Respondent Validation.” Sociology 12: 545–552. doi:10.1177/003803857801200307. [Crossref] , [PubMed]   [Google Scholar] ). In this system, searches are made for deviant cases that do not fit with a working ‘hypothesis’ and these are considered in relation to the need to modify and extend the conclusions in order to deepen the analysis. Thus, in this paper we report the findings to reflect the nuances in the expressed views of stakeholders. Initially the coding of transcripts was undertaken manually by Bloor. Subsequently, in re-considering the findings in relation to the issues reported here, the transcripts were re-analysed and coded with the assistance of the software programme NVIVO by Sampson. In line with standard practice amongst qualitative researchers, no attempt is made here to quantify these data as this would not be appropriate. Thus, no ‘trends’ or statistics are reported as such. The transcripts from the study have been anonymised and placed in the ESRC archive where they can be referenced for re-evaluation and confirmation.\nTowards the end of the research phase of the project, key findings were presented to a panel of experts (an electronic ‘Delphi group’) with the intention of arriving at a consensus relating to recommendations arising from the research. The Delphi group comprised one ship operator manager, one regulator, one port state control officer and one member of an environmental NGO. The recommendations which emerged as a result of this process are presented at the end of the paper and the process itself is further discussed in Bloor et al. ( 2013b Bloor, M., S. Baker, H. Sampson, and K. Dahlgren. 2013b. “Useful but No Oracle: Reflections on the Use of a Delphi Group in a Multi-Methods Policy Research Study.” Qualitative Research. doi:10.1177/1468794113504103. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ).\nThe enforcement of regulations pertaining to emission control areas\nWithin the ECAs, an initial limit on the sulphur content of fuel was set at 1.5%. This reduced to 1% in July 2010 and it is set to be reduced further (to just 0.1%) in January 2015. Further to this, since January 2010, all vessels calling at EU ports have been required to burn fuel with a sulphur content of just 0.1% whilst at anchor within port limits or at berth. Where operators prefer, sulphur abatement technology may be deployed (in the form of scrubbers) as an alternative to the purchase and consumption of the relatively highly priced low-sulphur fuel.\nThe enforcement of the regulations relating to air pollution in the ECAs has been undertaken by port state control officers. Two primary methods have been adopted: the examination of paper records such as vessel log books and bunker fuel delivery notes and the analysis of fuel samples. Fuel samples are not extensively used however and in 2010 just 149 samples were analysed in Sweden. Other EU countries (e.g. Netherlands, Germany, Denmark) analyse similarly small numbers of samples annually whilst the United Kingdom does not generally make use of fuel sample analysis in its enforcement of air-pollution regulation.\nIn addition, experiments have been conducted with the analysis of samples taken from vessel exhaust plumes using aircraft and lasers mounted at the entrance to the port of Gothenburg. Whilst the Swedish Maritime Authority has discontinued its use of aircraft-mounted laser monitoring equipment, there is some evidence that such experiments have had a deterrent effect.\nIn Sweden, an incentives programme is in place such that more favourable fairway dues 2 2.  Fairway dues are charged to defray the costs of ice-breaking and coastal lights. View all notes (and to a lesser extent port charges) are levied from vessels demonstrating constant use of low-sulphur fuel. This measure complements and encourages compliance with low-sulphur fuel regulations but it does not substitute for local enforcement.\nProblems for enforcement\nThe research highlighted several problems in relation to enforcement of the regulations. Of greatest concern is the difficulty for port state control officers in identifying fraudulent paperwork where this may exist. Bunker fuel delivery notes are generally checked in conjunction with log books in order to ascertain compliance with fuel usage in ECAs. As one port state control inspector described it, inspectors examine:\nMostly bunker delivery notes, which proves what type of bunker they are using and then you have the log book entry for the change over because normally they will burn high sulphur outside the ECA area. So when they are coming in, so like what time they change over. [Inspector]\nA second port state inspector confirmed this with his account:\nWe will be checking the bunker delivery note, it will be cross checking with oil record book, 2 entries. If the vessel is coming into the ECA area from outside, so then you would like to see the log book entries about the change over things, obviously change over time is depending on the type of the ship, type of engine and the arrangement of change over, also the capacity of the, if they are using the same bunker tank, service tank, then the capacity of the service tank and how long it will take, so there are some calculations to verify that they are burning the compliant fuel when they are inside the ECA, so that has to be demonstrated. [Inspector]\nSulphur levels on bunker delivery notes are often hand written and are frequently illegible (not least because the carbon copy deteriorates in storage), whilst log books are open to inaccuracy. An inspector explained his concerns as follows:\nI think the regulation for this bunker […] is not fully implemented in this country because I think you will find [in] foreign countries […] all this [is] closely controlled and monitored, which is not the case here. [Inspector]\nReliance on the checking of paperwork may not, as a result, be adequate in the face of deliberate contravention of regulations by unscrupulous ship operators. Furthermore, vessels which are transiting the ECAs rather than calling at ports within them may not be subject to such inspections and could escape detection.\nIn order to detect contravention of the regulations, by vessels transiting an ECA, the use of laser monitoring equipment might appear to be ideal, although thus far the intention has only been to use this technology as a screening device to identify potential candidates for fuel sampling and testing. As previously noted, experiments with airborne laser detection equipment have been discontinued. This was due to the hazards presented to aircraft in attempting to capture samples from vessel plumes. Such technical problems are compounded by the relatively high cost of such measures although the presence of ‘sniffer planes’ sends a powerful message to vessels and could act as a very useful deterrent.\nFinally in relation to the sampling of fuel, there are a couple of problems which are worth noting. The first issue relates to the time which is generally taken when samples are sent away to independent laboratories for testing. By the time that the results of the sample analysis are available to port state control officers, it is highly likely that a vessel will have sailed. Some port state control officers have access to fuel testing procedures that offer them rapid results. However, in the United Kingdom it was reported that such samples were rarely, if ever, taken. An inspector commented that:\n[…] they tell me that they get, once they reach the continent places like Germany in particular and to a lesser extent Denmark and Holland, they are having samples of their service tanks taken, and they some of them have been taken to court and they feel it is over the top, but as far as anything about what we do here none at all. [Inspector]\nThe response of ship operators to the introduction of ECAs and problems of compliance\nIncentives to avoid regulation\nA major financial incentive currently exists with regard to the avoidance of regulations pertaining to the use of low-sulphur fuel in ECAs. This results from the high price differential between low-sulphur fuel and higher-sulphur alternatives which, at time of writing (May 2013), is $23.00 per tonne. Once the 0.1% sulphur limit comes into force in ECAs in 2015, this incentive to non-compliance will be considerably increased, since (unless vessels have fitted scrubbers) they will have to operate continuously within ECAs on distillate fuel, currently costing $280 per tonne more than high-sulphur fuel.\nLogistical reasons for non-compliance\nAnother reason that companies may fail to comply with regulations is more logistical in as much as vessels with single service tanks may experience problems with fuel changeover. This is likely to be particularly the case when vessels are only intermittently trading in an ECA and where companies and chief engineers are inexperienced in making the requisite changeover. In well-established companies, procedures for fuel changeover are generally established by the company in consultation with chief engineers who are then expected to follow company procedure for changeover and demonstrate such compliance with procedure to port state control officers. Not only does this mean that ECA regulations should be effectively complied with, it also prevents the kind of engine damage that can occur if fuel changes are attempted too quickly. An operator explained:\nWe have company procedures that they must follow […] And that is part of our SMS with DOC as well, because you will get asked that on the audit. The audit they can ask me for, we have just had Isle of Man now [the flag state], and he said show me your changeover procedure and I will then go into the technical manual, show our actual PDF on this of what we would do, and he will say show me your chief doing it, and I will have to go back and look into the records and extract and say this vessel was going into Long Beach you can see what the chief did. [Employer]\nBut not all vessels follow an invariant changeover procedure and in the course of an observed PSCO inspection, a chief engineer remarked that he was following a different changeover procedure from that which had been logged by his predecessor. Changeovers on single-service-tank vessels, which involve flushing through the service tank with low-sulphur fuel oil, may result in inadvertent non-compliance since only very small quantities of high-sulphur fuel need to remain in the service tank for the additional low-sulphur fuel oil (which frequently has a sulphur content of 0.98%, 0.99% or 1.00%) to be thrown ‘off-spec’.\nProblems of off-spec fuel and bunker fuel delivery notes\nThere was some confidence expressed in the major suppliers of bunkers in as much as operators did not expect such suppliers to be found to be guilty of providing fuel that was different to the specification of the order (off-spec fuel). One such view was expressed as follows:\nIt wouldn’t be because it was off-spec when it was delivered because it is tested and guaranteed to be spec as per that note, as per that refinery, as per those people we are working with every day. [Employer]\nSuch confidence may have accumulated as a consequence of the regular practice in many major shipping firms of sending samples of the bunkers provided for analysis at their own choice of laboratory. If such analysis demonstrated that the fuel was off-spec with regard to sulphur content, operators suggested that they would immediately be in touch with their flag state administration and any other relevant authorities.\nIt is interesting to note however that despite the confidence expressed by some operators in the major suppliers of bunkers, this practice of sampling fuel had developed in the context of experience of less trustworthy suppliers. 3 3.  We note that inadvertent contamination of bunker supplies may occur due to incomplete tank cleaning processes between deliveries of parcels of fuel of different specification in terms of sulphur content. View all notes One operator told of a case when 4.5% sulphur fuel oil was bunkered (unknowingly) by one of their vessels in Denmark. He explained how:\nWe had this once last year, the vessel bunkered off the coast of Denmark and the fuel was 4.5 sulphur, how or why 4.5% MGO was even in Denmark in the first place we don’t know, it could have come from someone as a bad batch, it could have got in somewhere and they thought let’s get it out and we ended up taking it onboard the ship. And the danger I had was she burnt the fuel, the chief made a mistake in his calculations, he didn’t come to me and he was burning the fuel. I went to the vessel in Latvia and it came through and I said ‘chief whatever you do, do not burn that fuel’, he had 80 ton of it, I said ‘do not burn that fuel’, and he said ‘but I only have 25 ton left sir’. I said ‘what do you mean you have only got 25 ton left?’, and he said ‘I have been burning it’. So she had burnt 50 ton of fuel in the Baltic region, and if the Port State had gone onboard and said let me see the sample…! [Employer]\nSuch experiences had led to the alternative view that bunker suppliers could not always be trusted and that some would, as a consequence, be open to propositions from operators seeking to avoid compliance with ECA regulations via the use of fraud in the form of the provision of fraudulent bunker fuel delivery notes. One operator put it this way:\nWe deal with um, yeah we see ‘bad’ bunkering companies on a daily basis. There is no…around the world there is no trick that they haven’t tried, I mean they have a huge bible of how to cheat shipping companies for their fuel. So it’s really about the BDN [bunker fuel delivery note]—you can easily forge the BDN if that’s what you want to do. [Employer]\nThe potential for fraud was increased by what was acknowledged to be the very poor standard of bunker fuel delivery notes. 4 4.  We note that small profit margins may act as an incentive for fraud on the part of bunker suppliers although we did not establish any direct evidence of such fraud nor of the potential drivers for it within this study. View all notes As one operator put it, the standard of bunker fuel delivery notes was:\nVery poor, very, very poor. […] it depends where you are,[…] But even Europe sometimes it is very poor, it is kind of sometimes a barge turns up and he throws the line and he pumps it off and away he goes, no one really cares you know and it is very poor to be honest. I think that the standard should be a lot better really. [Employer]\nThis produced a view amongst some operators that enforcement of the ECA regulations actually had to be ‘beefed up’ and tightened rather than ‘watered down’. As one operator described:\nThere really has to be a much more elaborate system in place to ensure that there is going to be compliance. This is really what we want to opt for going forward. [Employer]\nHowever, this view was not universally held and there were concerns expressed about the establishment of greater surveillance, particularly in the form of the sampling of fuel by port state control officers.\nA different problem was brought to our attention by one ship manager whose contracts with charterers provided that it was the charterers rather than the ship managers who organised the supply of bunkers to vessels. Regardless of where the supply was sourced from, the ship manager sent samples to a single company for testing and reported that whilst they had sometimes been assured by a charterer that the fuel supplied was compliant, their tests had revealed that this was not the case. An interviewee explained:\nEverything is sampled through the [company name] but we source our bunkers from where ever the charterer will see fit to bunker which also causes us problems sometimes where the charterer will say this type of fuel is ok and acceptable we will bunker, I will then look at the sample and say ‘no, no, we can’t burn this for sulphur reasons, or I can’t burn this because it is the wrong fuel for the engine’, obviously we have to protect that as well. [Employer]\nConcerns over the fuel supply had resulted in this company taking very elaborate steps to ensure that the fuel they had delivered was compatible with all of their requirements. Given the length of time that it normally took to get sample results back from the laboratory 5 5.  The operator told us that if they were ‘desperate’ they could get test results back faster and as quickly as within a day but that this had cost implications so that standard practice was not to do this. View all notes , it seemed that their measures involved them in very careful forward planning. The following extended extract describes their procedures for testing and the time lag between the time of bunkering and the time when the fuel is cleared for use and some of the consequences of this strategy for planning and for profits:\nWe bunkered this up in Peterhead. That will go into the ship storage tank then, we will not burn that fuel. I wait then because when the barge, the barge will come on and he will give a sample of the fuel with ticket details and everything, that then is presented to us on the fuel sample. But I won’t go off that sample, I take a secondary sample then, when they are bunkering on the manifold we take it from out manifold, 10 minutes into the delivery so you know you are getting a good grade of fuel. That will then go for sampling, I will wait for the 2 sample data’s to come back to myself and I look at the first sample from the barge or the truck, and then our sample, and I will look then at the sulphur quantity, the densities, the viscosities, firstly because you want to see you haven’t been short measured, but then you are looking at all the contaminants underneath. And when I have looked then and I am satisfied with what quantities I see or contaminants then I will contact the ship as well because the email will be sent over to them with the attachment and we will say to the guys you know this fuel is acceptable to burn and you are ok to do that.[…] It is within 2 weeks normally, it is quite a long process. […]The charterer can’t be greedy and just say you need to bunker the fuel now or we are going to leave it to the last minute you put the fuel on and now you have to burn it, they can’t do that. [Employer]\nThis example is particularly interesting because it highlights the extent to which the monitoring of bunkers is already practiced by companies because of concerns relating to fuel contaminants and quality which would seem to indicate that careful monitoring of sulphur levels to guarantee compliance with sulphur-content requirements need not necessarily place an additional operational burden on vessels.\nConcerns over bunker tests by port state control\nAlthough operators were keen to have a ‘level playing field’ in relation to competition with other shipping lines, and while they believed that such a level playing field was best established with effective enforcement of sulphur regulations, they were nevertheless anxious about the idea of port state control officers sampling directly from their tanks. One employer outlined his concerns that these might not be a ‘fair’ test as follows:\nSo then we took it, it was .95 on the bunker note, it was .95 when it came out of the refinery, it might settle in the tanks, that tank might not be used for a few days that could then come into the service tank and port state control officers, again I have heard them go into the bottom of the tank, you know which if there is anything anywhere from you know previous parcels it might be towards the bottom of a tank, yeah? [Employer]\nThe interviewee is referring here to the phenomenon known as ‘stratification’ whereby blended low-sulphur fuel oil may undergo partial separation in storage, which can result in inadvertent non-compliance, when a sample is taken by port state from the vessel’s service tank. Subsequently, this operator went further in outlining his view that he did not wish to see port state control being exerted except in a highly targeted manner which would be likely to exempt his company’s vessels from scrutiny. This appeared to be part of a general view that regulation should be minimal which of course militates against the establishment of a ‘level playing field’ and is therefore in contradiction with his express wish for the establishment of such. As he put it:\nThe people who openly breach regulations should be caught and should be, you know when they are willingly trying to get around regulations, but things are in place for that and the regime that is already here is very adequate for that. I don’t think there is a need for the European commission or for member states to do more port state control than what they already do, I don’t think there is a need because the regime is, it is an intelligence led regime, like the customs. [Employer]\nWhere operators were more enthusiastic about the use of fuel sampling, they nevertheless acknowledged that what was required was a system providing very rapid results. As one explained:\nThey [currently utilised laboratories] can provide the test results after seven days and this does not work. In order to be able to hold back the vessel you need the test maybe four hours back… [Employer]\nThey were therefore relatively supportive of the test kits that were being utilised by some port state control officers (e.g. in The Netherlands). Although these tests were generally acknowledged to be less reliable than ‘send away’ laboratory tests, they were nevertheless supported by some who held the view that:\nNo, I’ve just been looking it up when I was talking to them. I don’t know what the reliability of those test kits is but I somehow doubt that it can be that bad otherwise they wouldn’t be using it. [Employer]\nFuture concerns\nShip operators were anxious about the forthcoming tightening of the sulphur regulations which were due to come into effect in the ECAs in 2015. The additional costs to shipping fuel with a sulphur content of 0.1% or less was felt likely to threaten the competiveness of the shipping industry. The price differentials were characterised as a ‘step change’ by one operator who estimated that it would result in a substantial increase in fuel costs. He suggested that:\nThe change from 1% to 0.1 is a step change, it is not a straight line, it is a step change. And what it means is you have to burn distillate marine gas oil instead of residual fuel oil. And the price premium for that is 70–80%. [Employer]\nIn relation to this price hike there were fears that the new regulation would precipitate a ‘modal shift’ in the transport of freight. This was because it was felt that the change in fuel would increase operator costs so significantly (a 20% increase was estimated by one operator) that freight hauliers would not be able to meet the extra costs. As the above employee went on to observe, such a modal shift would not only damage the shipping industry, as some companies would inevitably fail, but could carry with it negative consequences for ambient environmental quality.\nWe have some concerns mainly in relation to the 0.1% in 2015 which takes place within the emission control areas. We believe, in the big picture that will cause a modal shift, it’ll change flows of traffic, that can have the effect of putting more freight onto the roads. […] it could well be that freight hauliers choose to travel in their trucks […] to Dover and use the very short sea crossing or the tunnel in preference to using the longer sea transit. So we can see, not only in the UK but across Europe significant change to flows of traffic and that could actually have an adverse environmental effect putting more cargo on the roads as opposed to carrying it by sea—a less efficient mode of transport, overland freight as opposed to at sea. [Employer]\nFavoured regulatory checks\nAs has already been noted, not all operators were in favour of stronger enforcement of the regulations relating to air emissions in ECAs. However, those operators who were keen to make sure that competitors did not get away with avoiding the regulations in order to establish competitive advantage acknowledged that regulatory enforcement was not a simple matter.\nIn spite of the perceived difficulties inherent in an ‘auditing’ solution involving checks on bunker fuel delivery notes and samples of bunkers from service (or ‘day’) tanks, such a solution was seen as more practical than the implementation of technical solutions requiring vessels to carry on board emissions monitoring equipment that could be scrutinised by inspectors. As one interviewee explained, technical solutions seemed difficult:\nI mean if you just see it from applicability point of view, to install such a [monitoring] system on I don’t know, 40,000 vessels it just doesn’t seem feasible. So the testing I believe has to happen while you’re in port. [Employer]\nThis operator favoured an auditing solution involving paper checks and fuel samples. It was acknowledged however that testing in port did not resolve the problem of how to ensure compliance amongst vessels in transit (i.e. going through an ECA but not calling at a port in an ECA):\nOf course you would have to figure something out on how to police transiting vessels. That we don’t really know how one would handle yet but…[Employer]\nPolicy recommendations\nA variety of policy recommendations arise from this study and these are detailed fully in a report from the study which has been published on line (Bloor et al. 2013a Bloor, M., S. Baker, H. Sampson, and K. Dahlgren. 2013a. Effectiveness of International Regulation of Pollution Controls: The Case of the Governance of Ship Emissions. Cardiff: SIRC. ISBN 1-900174-44-8.  [Google Scholar] ). Three main recommendations may be regarded of particular interest here however.\nThe first is specific to inspection practice in the United Kingdom and relates to fuel testing and the piloting of ‘sample kits’ as utilised in Germany, Holland and Sweden. The pilot would provide the opportunity to establish the accuracy of different sampling/testing methods with a view to the introduction of such sampling and testing in the future within the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom (and other EU member states) will be obliged to comply by 18 June 2014 with a revised EU sulphur directive issued on 21 November 2012 which requires member states to undertake frequent fuel sampling and testing (European Union 2012 European Union. 2012. “Directive 2012/33/EU of the European Parliament and Council of 21 November 2012.” Official Journal of the European Union 30: 111–123.  [Google Scholar] ).\nThe second recommendation relates to the publication of information on the Equasis website about vessels non-compliant with the EU regulations on sulphur levels of fuel burnt in EU ports. Currently, this will only occur if the port state control officer noting the deficiency records it as a deficiency in conjunction with the vessel’s safety management system in breach of the IMO-ISM code. Such publication is seen to act as a major deterrent to non-compliance and the recommendation is thus to extend the publicity attendant to regulatory breaches.\nThe third recommendation relates to the development of the bunker fuel delivery note. It is suggested that this document should always be written in English, should record the sulphur content of fuel delivered (already an IMO requirement, but not always complied with), should record the registration number of the supplier and that it should be easy to determine if any fraudulent alterations have been made to the note.\nConclusions\nCurrently it is possible to identify a number of difficulties relating to the enforcement of emissions control regulations as they pertain to the North Sea and Baltic ECA. Such difficulties relate to problems with fuel testing, the reliability of bunker fuel delivery notes and technical problems associated with available laser ‘plume testing’ equipment. Notwithstanding these difficulties, at the current time it would appear that most companies are complying with current regulations and that at least some non-compliance may be inadvertent (produced as a result of the supply of ‘off-spec’ bunkers or associated with poor fuel changeover techniques on vessels with single service tanks). Companies expressed a desire for a level playing field to be established in relation to exhaust emissions from ships and yet some companies nevertheless resisted the idea that inspection should increase. Those companies in favour of greater inspection saw auditing solutions such as the inspection of bunker delivery notes and oil record books alongside fuel sampling as more practical than the installation of on-board emissions-monitoring equipment. In relation to the strengthening of existing enforcement, recommendations arising from the research include suggestions for improvements to the bunker delivery note, developing effective fuel sampling techniques following experimental ‘piloting’ and the ‘naming and shaming’ of companies that do not comply with EU emission regulations on the ‘Equasis’ website.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the UK’s Maritime & Coastguard Agency and Sweden’s Sjofartsverket and Transportstyrelsen for their assistance and support.

The main objective of this research paper is to assess the advances in the competitiveness of the pan-European rail freight services operated by a new-entrant (private) operator. Its main focus is to assess and contribute to the understanding of the advances towards competitiveness and the future prospects in the open European rail freight market, including dealing with challenges (e.g. dormant and departure of partners, suspension of the project, indistinct roles and responsibilities of operating partners) at different phases of the research, development and service offerings, that will be an important contribution to the Research and Development (R&D) policy and management arena in the Europe rail freight transport sector. The current research applies a case study research approach. The assessment of the rail freight service is performed by conducting two phases: first, a comparison of the progress between first and second year of the REorganisation of Transport networks by advanced RAil freight Concepts (RETRACK) rail freight service, operated by a new entrant and conducted on the corridor between two hubs – Cologne, Germany, and Györ, Hungary, and secondly a comparison of the opinions of customers on the RETRACK service and its competitors. From the comparative study between the first and second years, the study finds that the new-entrant operator was able to offer an increased number of services by consolidating cargo from satellite connections at both ends of the operational corridor by adopting a pragmatic and flexible approach. The customer satisfaction survey suggests that the new-entrant operator offered better service in terms of price, transit time, reliability and information flow/management compared to its competitors' services (offered by incumbent rail operators) on the corridor. However, their service was inferior to that of its competitors, in terms of frequency and availability of service. These less-well performed service factors have improved gradually over time. The study suggests that intra-rail competition has improved, but that inter-modal completion is yet to be achieved. The ups and downs of the project provide important lessons for R&D management, academia and policy makers. The study suggests that a pan-European rail freight service can be efficiently and effectively run by new-entrant operators, and this will lead to more intra-modal competition. However, they have yet to achieve competitiveness that will result in a shift of cargo from road to rail by offering an improved service that at least matches the major attributes of road freight service, e.g. price, transit time, door-to-door service and working in a collaborative way with other actors.\n""","2.2977335","""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/radm.12135/abstract""","[-1.615713,54.98032]"

STS are frequently expensive to the service operator but often allow for the social inclusion of a population group previously homebound. In this paper, five special transport schemes available in the London Borough of Camden are described, in particular the “ScootAbility” scheme, which provides mobility scooters and electric wheelchairs on loan. Advantages and drawbacks of all schemes are outlined and possible improvements are discussed. Further the user uptake of the ScootAbility scheme is analyzed through focus group discussions as well as travel diaries. The results are encouraging as they suggest that ScootAbility can fill in some gaps of previously unmet travel demand. The paper concludes by discussing the policy implications and suggesting that complex travel needs of an aging population can only be met by providing a multi-modal approach to STS, which needs to be co-ordinated in order to be sustainable.\n""","1.7831928","""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15568310802449392""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

While the importance of a well-functioning urban goods distribution system is widely acknowledged, city authorities have become increasingly aware of the need to minimise the negative impacts associated to the system. There are now countless examples of attempts to increase the eco-efficiency of urban freight deliveries; however, very few have made a notable impact. The success of such schemes often depends upon the response of a range of private sector freight stakeholders and their involvement during the planning process of these solutions is crucial.\nDesign/methodology/approach\n– To engage local freight stakeholders within the planning process of a city logistics project, the logical framework approach, in the form of the design and monitoring framework (DMF) developed by the Asian Development Bank, has been applied.\nFindings\n– The structured consultation process implied within the DMF approach allowed urban freight stakeholders to share their aspirations from the beginning of the city freight planning process, despite their differences in priorities in adopting eco-efficient logistics innovations. The process ensured that city stakeholders accepted and committed to the city logistics strategies formulated during the consultation process, namely: changes to the Limited Traffic Zone regulation, the use of an urban consolidation centre and hybrid electric truck adoption.\nResearch limitations/implications\n– The evaluation of the DMF application will be definitive after the demonstration/implementation stage of the city logistics project. It will then become clear if freight stakeholders have committed to the project and if it is effective in delivering the expected outputs and outcomes.\nPractical implications\n– Local city authorities may find this method useful in situations where a structured consultation process is needed for addressing urban freight issues. This is especially the case in the context of introducing innovative, eco-efficiency solutions.\nOriginality/value\n– The application of DMF in the developed environment can be considered novel; this paper extends this with an application to the promotion of sustainable urban freight.\nKeywords:\n""","0.029557627","""http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/SCM-05-2014-0149""","[-1.615713,54.98032]"

The implementation of such technologies by third party logistics providers (3PLs) allows the real-time exchange of information between supply chain partners, thereby improving planning capability and customer service. However, the logistics and freight transport industry is lagging somewhat behind other sectors in ICT diffusion. In relation to the latter point, it is important to note that the dissemination of ICT in logistics and supply chain management (SCM) is shifting the 3PL industry to an increasingly knowledge-intensive approach. In this process, the role of learning becomes more central and an assessment of the impact of future ICT learning needs for the logistics providers is a strategic imperative. The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of ICT on logistics and freight transport industry in Italy and Ireland, and to identify learning needs for more effective ICT adoption in 3PLs.\n""","1.0","""https://research.aston.ac.uk/portal/en/researchoutput/ict-adoption-by-logistics-service-providers(05518a55-a91c-4cdb-b005-87140873d5dd).html""","[-1.888803,52.487018]"

However, there is relatively little research quantifying the extent to which these links are affected by the transport system, especially by the presence of road infrastructure and traffic in the areas where people walk. This paper proposes two indicators for assessing the effects of the transport system on walking mobility and on associated health risks and opportunities in urban regions.   Exposure to roadside air pollution and noise may increase the risk of several diseases. The proposed indicator looks at the levels to which people are exposed to these risks when they walk around their homes. The modelling of this effect uses a geographic information system (GIS) and a large set of data (such as land use maps, business locations and satellite images) to identify daily walking destinations for the residents of each census unit, including workplaces, schools, and bus stops. The optimal pedestrian routes used to access these destinations are estimated using network analysis. Information on employment status and work and study locations and starting time is then overlaid with pollution maps for different times of day, estimating the exposures of different segments of the population.   Community severance (also known as the barrier effect) also has a potential negative impact on human health. This is because the presence of large infrastructure affects people's propensity for walking and for social interaction, two factors usually associated with good health. A sampling procedure is used to derive a set of destinations where the residents of the census unit walk to meet other people, assuming that the probability of travelling to each place is proportional to its population density. The indicator of severance in a census unit is defined as the population living in places that cannot be accessed by unless crossing a transport barrier. The effects of different barriers (limited-access motorways vs. other roads) are compared.   The distribution of the two indicators can be mapped and overlaid with the distribution of different groups, assessing the potential role of road transport in generating health inequalities. This is illustrated in an application for the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. The maps show that exposure to traffic pollution is especially severe in the central parts of the metropolitan area, which have large proportions of elderly people. A set of 'hotspots', areas faring poorly in both pollution exposure and community severance, is also identified. These areas are located in some of the main commuting corridors, and are characterized by high proportions of populations with low socioeconomic status and relatively high concentrations of slum areas.\nPublication data is maintained in RPS.

Local residents may avoid walking, with negative impacts in levels of physical activity and in the ability to access local facilities and social networks. The reduction of walking trips may also be compensated with an increase in the use of private vehicles, aggravating levels of noise and air pollution.   The Street Mobility project at University College London (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/street-mobility) set out to understand the impacts of busy roads on pedestrians. The project involved researchers from a variety of backgrounds working together with local communities and other stakeholders. The research focused on four areas around busy roads in England, and used five different methods:  * Informal mapping workshops revealed that people develop strategies to avoid certain parts of busy roads, such as major junctions * Street audits identified problems in pedestrian infrastructure, such as long waiting times at signalised crossings and poor hygiene and lighting in footbridges and underpasses. * Video surveys showed a high incidence of risky behaviours such as crossing away from designated facilities. * A mobility and wellbeing survey found that the volume of local traffic affected the ability to walk of local residents, with negative impacts on wellbeing * A stated preference survey found that the benefit of reducing the road width from 3 to 2 vehicles lanes is £1.39 per person per trip, the benefit of reducing traffic levels from high to medium is £0.94 and the benefit of reducing speed limits below 30mph is £0.49.  These methods were integrated into a toolkit that is available online (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/street-mobility/toolkit) that can be used by local authorities and local communities. Project members are currently discussing the possibility of incorporating some of the tools in national guidance documents for transport appraisal in the United Kingdom and working on research proposals to adapt the toolkit to the context of cities in other countries.\nPublication data is maintained in RPS.

In this scenario, optimising the exploitation of urban road networks is a pivotal challenge. Existing urban traffic control approaches, based on complex mathematical models, can effectively deal with planned-Ahead events, but are not able to cope with unexpected situations -such as roads blocked due to car accidents or weather-related events- because of their huge computational requirements. Therefore, such unexpected situations are mainly dealt with manually, or by exploiting pre-computed policies. Our goal is to show the feasibility of using mixed discrete-continuous planning to deal with unexpected circumstances in urban traffic control. We present a PDDL+ formulation of urban traffic control, where continuous processes are used to model flows of cars, and show how planning can be used to efficiently reduce congestion of specified roads by controlling traffic light green phases. We present simulation results on two networks (one of them considers Manchester city centre) that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, compared with fixed-Time and reactive techniques.\n""","0.023831462","""https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/efficient-macroscopic-urban-traffic-models-for-reducing-congestion(7abd3cf0-9e53-43c0-8df7-22976e0738dc).html""","[-0.116938,51.510732]"

This is the case when the trafficking involves cargo containers. Thus, suitable detection techniques are required to penetrate a ferromagnetic enclosure. The present study considers techniques that employ an electromagnetic based principle of detection. It is generally assumed that a ferromagnetic metallic enclosure will effectively act as a Faraday cage to electromagnetic radiation and therefore screen any form of interrogating electromagnetic radiation from penetrating, thus denying the detection of any eventual hidden material. In contrast, we demonstrate that it is actually possible to capture magnetic images of a conductive object through a set of metallic ferromagnetic enclosures. This validates electromagnetic interrogation techniques as a potential detection tool for National Nuclear Security applications.\nPublication data is maintained in RPS.

Perego. 2010. “The Role of Knowledge Management in Supply Chains: Evidence from the Italian Food Industry.” International Journal of Networking and Virtual Organisations 7 (2/3): 163–183.10.1504/IJNVO.2010.031216 [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ; Sodhi and Son 2009 Soni, G., and R. Kodali. 2012. “Evaluating Reliability and Validity of Lean, Agile and Leagile Supply Chain Constructs in Indian Manufacturing Industry.” Production Planning & Control 23 (10–11): 864–884.10.1080/09537287.2011.642207 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). Through their empirical findings, Cao et al. (2010) Braziotis, C., and J. Tannock. 2011. “Building the Extended Enterprise: Key Collaboration Factors.” The International Journal of Logistics Management 22 (3): 349–372.10.1108/09574091111181363 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] report that a major strategic impact of an SC collaborative venture is the accumulation of knowledge resources from all SC partners and utilising this knowledge for effective organisational performance.\nAs reported by Desouza, Chattaraj, and Kraft ( 2003 Desouza, K. C., A. Chattaraj, and G. Kraft. 2003. “Supply Chain Perspectives to Knowledge Management: Research Propositions.” Journal of Knowledge Management 7 (3): 129–138.10.1108/13673270310485695 [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ), knowledge management clearly relates with the SCM discipline thereby sharing and synchronising external knowledge with SC partners and increasing inter-organisational efficiency. Malhotra, Gasain, and Sawy (2005) Madhok, A., and S. B. Tallman. 1998. “Resources, Transactions and Rents: Managing Value through Interfirm Collaborative Relationships.” Organization Science 9 (3): 326–339.10.1287/orsc.9.3.326 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] further highlight the significance of the two disciplines and state that collaboration between SC partners is not simply based on transactions; it influences information sharing and knowledge formation for sustainable environment and achieving competitive advantage. According to Esper et al. ( 2010 Esper, T. L., A. E. Ellinger, T. P. Stank, D. J. Flint, and M. Moon. 2010. “Demand and Supply Integration: A Conceptual Framework of Value Creation through Knowledge Management.” Journal of the Academy Marketing Science 38 (1): 5–18.10.1007/s11747-009-0135-3 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ), knowledge-based theories of the firm highlight the strategic significance of leveraging knowledge, for instance, marketplace statistics and business intelligence to support and boost organisational performance.\n•\nStrategic Supply Chain Partnership (SSCP): Cooperative relationships among the SC partners (also referred to as partnering) is a vital element in enabling the integration of different actors’ skills and knowledge and in efforts to mutually solve problems (Eriksson 2010 Eriksson, P. E. 2010. “Improving Construction Supply Chain Collaboration and Performance: A Lean Construction Pilot Project.” Supply Chain Management: An International Journal 15 (5): 394–403. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). SCC is one such initiative that has encouraged many inter-organisational SC players for sharing knowledge and experiences to strengthen their partnerships (Ramanathan and Gunasekaran, 2014 Ramanathan, U., and A. Gunasekaran. 2014. “Supply Chain Collaboration: Impact of Success in Long-term Partnerships.” International Journal of Production Economics 147 (Part B): 252–259. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). In the words of He, Ghibadian, and Gallear (2013) He, Q., D. Gallear, and A. Ghobadian. 2011. “Knowledge Transfer: The Facilitating Attributes in Supply-Chain Partnerships.” Information Systems Management 28 (1): 57–70. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] SCP is most extensively implemented form of collaborative inter-organisational coalition that supports knowledge acquisition and sustainable organisational as well as environmental performance. For example, multinational organisations such as West-Marine, Procter & Gamble and Hewlett–Packard have developed successful SC partnerships and realised the benefits of SC collaborations such as reduced costs, enhanced sales, better forecast precision and eco-friendliness. In line with these collaborations, Toktay, Wein, and Zenios ( 2000) Tracey, M., and R. Neuhaus. 2013. “Purchasing’s Role in Global New Product-process Development Projects.” Journal of Purchasing & Supply Management 19 (2): 98–105.10.1016/j.pursup.2013.02.004 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] state that benefit sharing is the underlying constituent of such strategic SC partnerships. Thus, a mutual controlling mechanism between the partnering organisations also supports shared decision-making, reduced information irregularities and increased knowledge transfer.\n•\nSupply Chain Strategy and Alignment (SCSA): The misalignment of SC strategy with the business strategy can often lead to project failure (Braziotis and Tannock 2011 Braunscheidel, M. J., and N. C. Suresh. 2009. “The Organizational Antecedents of a Firm’s Supply Chain Agility for Risk Mitigation and Response.” Journal of Operations Management 27 (2): 119–140.10.1016/j.jom.2008.09.006 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). It is important for small enterprises and manufacturing businesses to evaluate their investments, and once aligned, it facilitates these organisations to perform better in terms of growth, efficiency and prosperity (Raymond and Bergeron 2008 Raymond, L., and F. Bergeron. 2008. “Enabling the Business Strategy of SMEs through E-Business Capabilities: A Strategic Alignment Perspective.” Industrial Management & Data Systems 108 (5): 577–595. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). Being integrated through shared knowledge and process alignment, SC partners function as if they were a component of a single organisation (Cao et al. 2010 Braziotis, C., and J. Tannock. 2011. “Building the Extended Enterprise: Key Collaboration Factors.” The International Journal of Logistics Management 22 (3): 349–372.10.1108/09574091111181363 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). In this context, Sakka, Millet, and Botta-Genoulaz ( 2011 Sakka, O., P. A. Millet, and V. Botta-Genoulaz. 2011. “An Ontological Approach for Strategic Alignment: A Supply Chain Operations Reference Case Study.” International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing 24 (11): 1022–1037.10.1080/0951192X.2011.575798 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) recommend that to facilitate collective innovativeness, it is essential to align strategic vision and innovation objectives throughout the organisation, along with managing boundaries to enable collaboration across inter-organisational SCs. In terms of mutual financial outcomes, managements need to align their goals and outcomes with SC partners for developing collaborative advantage. Cao and Zhang (2011) Cao, M., M. A. Vonderembse, Q. Zhang, and T. S. Ragu-Nathan. 2010. “Supply Chain Collaboration: Conceptualisation and Instrument Development.” International Journal of Production Research 48 (22): 6613–6635.10.1080/00207540903349039 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] maintain that such concerted gain directly surges the financial performance of each supply chain partner.\nThe above discussion clearly indicates the importance of the three strategic dimension factors. In order to identify the weightings of each factor (see Tables 1–8 ), the authors conducted a profiling research through the Scopus database.\nEnabling sustainable energy futures: factors influencing green supply chain collaboration\nAll authors\n3.2.2. Managerial dimension\n•\nManagement Commitment and Support (MCS): The key to accomplishing an anticipated collaborative breakthrough is to establish strong management commitment towards SCM (Anbanandam, Banwet, and Shankar 2011 Amin, S. H., and G. Zhang. 2012. “An Integrated Model for Closed-loop Supply Chain Configuration and Supplier Selection: Multi-Objective Approach.” Expert Systems with Applications 39 (15): 6782–6791.10.1016/j.eswa.2011.12.056 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). The significance of SC does not come from merely developing collaborative ventures; rather from mutually reforming (i.e. greening) both operational and management processes within the SC organisation (Diabat and Simchi-Levi 2009 Diabat, A., and D. Simchi-Levi. 2009. “A Carbon-capped Supply Chain Network Problem.” IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management. 523–527.  [Google Scholar] ). In this context, the key responsibility of management is the provision of adequate monetary support, resources and their constant commitment (Min et al. 2005 Miles, M., and A. Huberman. 1994. Qualitative Data Analysis: An Expanded Sourcebook. Newbury Park, CA: Sage. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ). The latter argument is supported by Fawcett et al. ( 2006 Fawcett, S. E., J. A. Ogden, G. M. Magnan, and M. B. Cooper. 2006. “Organizational Commitment and Governance for Supply Chain Success.” International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management 36 (1): 22–35.10.1108/09600030610642913 [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ), who state that commitment should come from all levels of the organisation and their SC partners. Only senior management can commit the resources and calibrate the incentives to develop factual cross-functional competences. Organisations are more likely to have proactive sustainable environmental strategies if there is high commitment by managers and they interpret environmental issues as opportunities (Sharma 2000 Shaw, K., R. Shankar, S. S. Yadav, and L. S. Thakur. 2012. “Supplier Selection Using Fuzzy AHP and Fuzzy Multi-Objective Linear Programming for Developing Low Carbon Supply Chain.” Expert Systems with Applications 39 (9): 8182–8192.10.1016/j.eswa.2012.01.149 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ).\nResearch on SCM and SCC has identified a positive connection amid top management’s participation in continuing collaborative ventures. For instance, a high degree of management commitment and support in the collaboration venture is recognised as a predictor for successful inter-organisational relationships (Sheu, Yen, and Chae 2006 Simatupang, T. M., and R. Sridharan. 2002. “The Collaborative Supply Chain.” Business Process Management Journal 14 (3): 401–418. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ).\n•\nManagement Skills and Knowledge (MSK): The availability of personnel with ample capabilities and knowledge for generating original ideas and concepts is a vital factor for success in any business sector, logistics and to sustain the strategic importance of SCM (Thai 2012 Toktay, L. B., L. M. Wein, and S. A. Zenios. 2000. “Inventory Management of Remanufacturable Products.” Management Science 46 (11): 1412–1426.10.1287/mnsc.46.11.1412.12082 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). Management capabilities include effective and efficient management of operations, synchronisation and communication with the workforce, project management and governance proficiencies. Such extensive experience and knowledge will facilitate the management of supplier–retailer networks to produce improved SCC and performance (Sheu, Yen, and Chae 2006 Simatupang, T. M., and R. Sridharan. 2002. “The Collaborative Supply Chain.” Business Process Management Journal 14 (3): 401–418. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ). This indicates that by ensuring the availability of capable managers, an organisation can employ their services for support in developing both new and existing sets of business requirements. Other managerial competencies include management awareness of the benefits of the new SC systems that may result in high commitment towards successfully implementing SCC (Tsinopoulos and Bell 2010 Vachon, S., and R. D. Klassen. 2006. “Extending Green Practices across the Supply Chain: The Impact of Upstream and Downstream Integration.” International Journal of Operations & Production Management 26 (2): 299–315.  [Google Scholar] ). In Eltantawy’s ( 2008 Eltantawy, R. 2008. “Supply Management Contribution to Channel Performance: A Top Management Perspective.” Management Research News 31 (3): 152–168.10.1108/01409170810851267 [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ) words, SC managers must be capable and knowledgeable enough to determine and develop the fundamental skills that their departments require from them.\n•\nSupply Chain Management Style (SCMS): The type of management style can be effective for investing time and resources, evaluating and sustaining SCs, and managing SC performance (Robinson and Malhotra 2005 Raymond. L., A. M. Croteau, and F. Bergeron. 2011. “The Strategic Role of IT: An Empirical Study of Its Impact on IT Performance in Manufacturing SMEs.” Paper presented at the Sixth International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services, St. Maarten, The Netherlands Antilles, 89–97.  [Google Scholar] ). For example, Ou et al. (2010) Orsato, R. J. 2006. “Competitive Environmental Strategies: When Does It Pay to Be Green?” California Management Review 48 (2): 127–143.10.2307/41166341 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] emphasise that it is the leadership that pushes the overall SC system that results in enhanced financial outcomes and customer contentment. Ho and Lin (2004) Heikkilä, J. 2002. “From Supply to Demand Chain Management: Efficiency and Customer Satisfaction.” Journal of Operations Management 20 (6): 747–767.10.1016/S0272-6963(02)00038-4 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] argue here that if differences in opinions and management styles are not well understood and managed within the SC, they may potentially lead to project failures. Top management’s role is to assess the main strategic partners, determining and sharing the vision, knowledge and SC strategy, organising collaboration seminars, scrutinising overall SC performance, and offering incentive structures to develop performance. McKinnon (2012) McCarter, M. W., S. E. Fawcett, and G. M. Magnan. 2005. “The Effect of People on the Supply Chain World: Some Overlooked Issues.” Human Systems Management 24 (3): 197–208.  [Google Scholar] reports that the business mantra ‘if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it’ relates as much to carbon emissions as to resources and costs. Thus, organisations subject to government control on carbon emissions are legitimately required to gauge their emissions precisely and consistently. van Hoek, Chatham, and Wilding (2002) Ho, L., and G. Lin. 2004. “Critical Success Factor Framework for the Implementation of Integrated Enterprise Systems in the Manufacturing Environment.” International Journal of Production Research 42 (17): 3731–3742.10.1080/00207540410001721781 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] report that effective leadership is an important stimulus for directing, managing and attaining impactful SCM performance. Certainly, management style seems to have a direct as well as indirect effect on inter-organisational SC success (Overstreet et al. 2013 Ou, C. S., F. C. Liu, Y. C. Hung, and D. C. Yen. 2010. “A Structural Model of Supply Chain Management on Firm Performance.” International Journal of Operations & Production Management 30 (5): 526–545.10.1108/01443571011039614 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ).\n3.2.3. Organisational dimension\n•\nEffective Supply Chain Communication (ESCC): Researchers such as Bezuidenhout, Bodhanya, and Brenchley (2012) Beulens, A. J. M., D.-F. Broens, P. Folstar, and G. J. Hofstede. 2005. “Food Safety and Transparency in Food Chains and Networks Relationships and Challenges.” Food Control 16 (6): 481–486.10.1016/j.foodcont.2003.10.010 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] and Cao et al. (2010) Braziotis, C., and J. Tannock. 2011. “Building the Extended Enterprise: Key Collaboration Factors.” The International Journal of Logistics Management 22 (3): 349–372.10.1108/09574091111181363 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] assert that SC synchronisation and knowledge creation can only occur if there is a sufficient level of communication. According to Machikita and Ueki ( 2013 London, K., and V. Singh. 2013. “Integrated Construction Supply Chain Design and Delivery Solutions.” Architectural Engineering and Design Management 9 (3): 135–157.10.1080/17452007.2012.684451 [Taylor & Francis Online]   [Google Scholar] ), tangible knowledge embodied in capital goods can be simply relocated by way of simple inter-organisational SC transactions. Nevertheless, disembodied knowledge cannot be transmitted through direct communication between upstream and downstream SC partners. Paulraj, Lado, and Chen ( 2008 Paulraj, A., A. Lado, and I. Chen. 2008. “Inter-organizational Communication as a Relational Competency: Antecedents and Performance Outcomes in Collaborative Buyer–Supplier Relationships.” Journal of Operations Management 26 (1): 45–64.10.1016/j.jom.2007.04.001 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) argue that miscommunication results in conflicts and misperceptions between SC partners and this jeopardises the whole collaborative venture. Thus, the formation and growth of SC partnerships can only flourish when instigated with effective communications between potential SC partners (Cassivi 2006 Carbon Trust, 2006. Carbon Footprint in the Supply Chain: The Next Step for Business. Report No. CTC616. London: Carbon Trust.  [Google Scholar] ). SC collaboration is not merely transaction-based; it influences sharing of information and knowledge creation for sustainable competitive advantage and environmental performance (Malhotra, Gasain, and Sawy 2005 Madhok, A., and S. B. Tallman. 1998. “Resources, Transactions and Rents: Managing Value through Interfirm Collaborative Relationships.” Organization Science 9 (3): 326–339.10.1287/orsc.9.3.326 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). Cristea ( 2011 Cristea, A. D. 2011. “Buyer–Seller Relationships in International Trade: Evidence from US States’ Exports and Business-Class Travel.” Journal of International Economics 84 (2): 207–220.10.1016/j.jinteco.2011.02.003 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) argues that effective communication can facilitate the knowledge transfer process and support a decrease in international trading costs. Effective communication does not necessarily infer a greater level of communication frequency, but more bi-directionality and shared content (Bezuidenhout, Bodhanya, and Brenchley 2012 Beulens, A. J. M., D.-F. Broens, P. Folstar, and G. J. Hofstede. 2005. “Food Safety and Transparency in Food Chains and Networks Relationships and Challenges.” Food Control 16 (6): 481–486.10.1016/j.foodcont.2003.10.010 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ).\n•\nInterdependence in Supply Chains (ISC): The collaborative paradigm in the SC discipline suggests that organisations function within a network of inter-dependent affiliations developed and nurtured through strategic integration (Stevens and Johnson 2016 Stock, J. R., S. L. Boyer, and T. Harmon. 2010. “Research Opportunities in Supply Chain Management.” Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science 38 (1): 32–41.10.1007/s11747-009-0136-2 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ; Vachon and Klassen 2006 VICS (Voluntary Inter-industry Commerce Standards Association). 1998. “Collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment, CPFR.” www.cpfr.org .  [Google Scholar] ). This paradigm is supported by Sheu, Yen, and Chae (2006) Simatupang, T. M., and R. Sridharan. 2002. “The Collaborative Supply Chain.” Business Process Management Journal 14 (3): 401–418. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] who state that mutual dependence or interdependence between SC partners is of high significance for inter-organisational affiliations. According to Heikkilä (2002) Heaslip, G., A. M. Sharif, and A. Althonayan. 2012. “Employing a Systems-based Perspective to the Identification of Inter-relationships within Humanitarian Logistics.” International Journal of Production Economics 139 (2): 377–392.10.1016/j.ijpe.2012.05.022 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , mutual dependence of an organisation on an SC partner signifies the organisation’s necessity to sustain a connection with the other partners in the SC in order to accomplish its goals. On the other hand, Chae, Yen, and Sheu (2005) Cervellon, M.-C., and A.-S. Wernerfelt. 2012. “Knowledge Sharing among Green Fashion Communities Online Lessons for the Sustainable Supply Chain.” Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management 16 (2): 176–192.10.1108/13612021211222860 [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] report that interdependence exists when one SC partner does not completely govern the whole SC operation. Interdependencies in business partnerships are not new as explained by Cook ( 1977 Cook, K. 1977. “Exchange and Power in Networks of Interorganizational Relations.” The Sociological Quarterly 18 (1): 62–82.10.1111/tsq.1977.18.issue-1 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ), reliance in a business affiliation is developed between trading partners, and through such dependences the partners positive/negatively impact the business practices of their SC partners and eventually overall business performance. Retaining a social connection between interdependent SC partners may also support the development of trust-based relationships. Thus, it is this interdependence that inspires the readiness to share knowledge resources with other SC partners.\n•\nOrganisational Culture (OC): Robinson, Sahin, and Gao ( 2005 Robinson, C. J., and M. K. Malhotra. 2005. “Defining the Concept of Supply Chain Quality Management and Its Relevance to Academic and Industrial Practice.” International Journal of Production Economics 96 (3): 315–337.10.1016/j.ijpe.2004.06.055 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) perceive organisational culture as key to a sustainable competitive advantage in SCs. Zeleny (2005) Zhao, X., B. Huo, B. B. Flynn, and J. H. Y. Yeung. 2008. “The Impact of Power and Relationship Commitment on the Integration between Manufacturers and Customers in a Supply Chain.” Journal of Operations Management 26 (3): 368–388.10.1016/j.jom.2007.08.002 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] argues that although information sharing is vital for an SC to sustain effective operations, it is the transforming of information into knowledge and sharing of (new) knowledge that allows organisations to remain competitive, and eventually the SC partnerships to remain competitive. If individual SC partners are not able to change information into knowledge and manage knowledge flow, then the SC partnership will not be able to produce the synergy essential to effectively compete against other SCs. Meng ( 2012 McKinnon, A. C. 2012. “Product-level Carbon Auditing of Supply Chains: Environmental Imperative or Wasteful Distraction?” International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management 40 (1/2): 42–60. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) argues here that to have such a synergistic atmosphere, management needs to be in a position to closely work with and influence their workforce in order to transform the information into processes and knowledge that is shared among them. Transforming the culture is the key to leveraging organisational staff. In the absence of the right culture, the SC will fail to use their workforces effectively to transfer their urge into SC initiatives. Robinson, Sahin, and Gao ( 2005 Robinson, C. J., and M. K. Malhotra. 2005. “Defining the Concept of Supply Chain Quality Management and Its Relevance to Academic and Industrial Practice.” International Journal of Production Economics 96 (3): 315–337.10.1016/j.ijpe.2004.06.055 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) however, argue that the organisations’ cultural compatibility must be considered by the SC manager, so as to avoid the SC performance being directly and indirectly influenced by these chain cultures.\n3.2.4 Operational dimension\n•\nReverse Logistics (RL): Reverse logistics is a ‘backwards’ operating process, i.e. it consists of processes and functions related to the reuse of products (Amin and Zhang 2012 Alavi, M., T. R. Kayworth, and D. E. Leidner. 2005. “An Empirical Examination of the Influence of Organizational Culture on Knowledge Management Practices.” Journal of Management Information Systems 22 (3): 191–224. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). The extant body of literature highlights the significance of research conducted into RL systems, i.e. it offers pragmatic solutions for strategic business organisations in how to deal with the issues of implementing reverse flow. Advocates, such as Efendigil, Onut, and Kongar ( 2008 Efendigil, T., S. Onut, and E. Kongar. 2008. “A Holistic Approach for Selecting a Third-party Reverse Logistics Provider in the Presence of Vagueness.” Computers and Industrial Engineering 54 (2): 269–287.10.1016/j.cie.2007.07.009 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) and Sharif et al. (2012) Sharma, S. 2000. “Managerial Interpretations and Organizational Context as Predictors of Corporate Choice of Environmental Strategy.” Academy of Management Journal 43 (4): 681–697.10.2307/1556361 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , also highlight the significance of RL by stating that implementing an efficient RL structure can improve an organisation’s return on investment and competitiveness in the marketplace. Multinational organisations such as Caterpillar have developed a whole new division based on the RL school of thought. RL is becoming a competitive necessity for many organisations (Jack, Powers, and Skinner 2010 Iyer, K. N. S. 2011. “Demand Chain Collaboration and Operational Performance: Role of IT Analytic Capability and Environmental Uncertainty.” Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing 26 (2): 81–91.10.1108/08858621111112267 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). The existence of an RL programme has provided organisations with direct monetary by decreasing the use of raw materials, by adding value with recovery, or by reducing disposal costs, thereby enabling sustainable environmental performance (De Brito 2003 De Brito, M. P. 2003. “Managing Reverse Logistics or Reversing Logistics Management.” The Erasmus Research Institute of Management (ERIM) PhD Series, N.35. Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.  [Google Scholar] ). Similar research indicates that organisations focusing on RL systems are redesigning their structures and relationships, creating a knowledge chain that facilitates and improves data, knowledge sharing and coordination, decision-making and planning (Sharif et al. 2012 Sharma, S. 2000. “Managerial Interpretations and Organizational Context as Predictors of Corporate Choice of Environmental Strategy.” Academy of Management Journal 43 (4): 681–697.10.2307/1556361 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ).\n•\nSupply Chain Agility (SCA): To be a global competitive entity, companies need to align with their suppliers and customers so as to restructure their functions and work collaboratively to achieve a level of agility (Shao 2013 Shao, X.-F. 2013. “Supply Chain Characteristics and Disruption Mitigation Capability: An Empirical Investigation in China.” International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications 16 (4): 277–295. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ; Soni and Kodali 2012 Soosay, C. A., and P. Hyland. 2015. “A Decade of Supply Chain Collaboration and Directions for Future Research.” Supply Chain Management: An International Journal 20 (6): 613–630.10.1108/SCM-06-2015-0217 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). Researchers, such as Swafford, Ghosh, and Murthy (2006) Thai, V. V. 2012. “Competency Requirements for Professionals in Logistics and Supply Chain Management.” International Journal of Logistics: Research and Applications 15 (2): 109–126.10.1080/13675567.2012.694859 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] and Braunscheidel and Suresh (2009) Bowersox, D. J., D. J. Closs, and T. P. Stank. 2003. “How to Master Cross-enterprise Collaboration.” Supply Chain Management Review 7 (4): 18–27.  [Google Scholar] , describe SCA as a type of functional capability that refers to an organisation’s capacity to perform operational activities together with SC partners so as to adjust or react to market fluctuations rapidly. According to Chopra and Sodhi ( 2004 Chopra, S., and M. S. Sodhi. 2004. “Managing Risk to Avoid Supply Chain Breakdown.” Sloan Management Review 46 (1): 53–61.  [Google Scholar] ), agile organisations can reduce inventory risks by collaborating and functioning with highly responsive suppliers and distributors, exchange essential knowledge with SC members, and can also reduce capacity risks by making existing capacity more flexible. For instance, Toyota reduces capacity risks by ensuring that each plant is flexible and has enough stock to be able to supply to more markets (Chopra and Sodhi 2004 Chopra, S., and M. S. Sodhi. 2004. “Managing Risk to Avoid Supply Chain Breakdown.” Sloan Management Review 46 (1): 53–61.  [Google Scholar] ). Organisations need to collaborate with SC partners to perform linked activities (e.g. design, manufacture and delivery of products or services) more efficiently and mutually manage industry unpredictability to acquire competitive advantage ( Liu et al. 2013 Linton, J., R. Kalssen, and V. Jayaraman. 2007. “Sustainable Supply Chains: An Introduction.” Journal of Operations Management 25 (6): 1075–1082.10.1016/j.jom.2007.01.012 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). In this context, SCA, which is primarily about customer receptiveness, is vital in ensuring the organisation’s competitiveness as it facilitates efficient responses to operational changes (e.g. procurement, manufacturing, delivery and market promotion).\n•\nSupply Chain Transparency (SCT): Beulens et al. (2005, 482) Benjaafar, S., B. Li, and M. Daskin. 2013. “Carbon Footprint and the Management of Supply Chains: Insights from Simple Models.” IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering 10 (1): 99–116.10.1109/TASE.2012.2203304 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] define SCT ‘as the degree to which an SC player has access to relevant information about products, processes and flows of capital without loss, noise, delay and distortion’.\nTransparent information and knowledge exchange in SC collaborative ventures is claimed to be a leading component behind all organisational successes (Ireland and Crum 2005 Irani, Z., A. M. Sharif, M. M. Kamal, and P. E. D. Love. 2014. “Visualising a Knowledge Mapping of Information Systems Evaluation.” Expert Systems and Applications 41 (1): 105–125.10.1016/j.eswa.2013.07.015 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). SCT is an indicator of the quality, availability, accuracy, accessibility and facts about SC data (Bastian and Zentes 2013 Barratt, M. 2004. “Understanding the Meaning of Collaboration in the Supply Chain.” Supply Chain Management: An International Journal 9 (1): 30–42.10.1108/13598540410517566 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). To accomplish enhancements in collaboration with SC partners, transparency beyond organisational boundaries is required (Shao 2013 Shao, X.-F. 2013. “Supply Chain Characteristics and Disruption Mitigation Capability: An Empirical Investigation in China.” International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications 16 (4): 277–295. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). According to Liu et al. (2013) Linton, J., R. Kalssen, and V. Jayaraman. 2007. “Sustainable Supply Chains: An Introduction.” Journal of Operations Management 25 (6): 1075–1082.10.1016/j.jom.2007.01.012 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , the integrated and transparent flow of information facilitates organisations’ acquisition of quality, rich and reliable content and real-time information across the SC to further enhance the SCT. SCT has two extents, i.e. horizontal (e.g. denotes situations, strategies and organisational business processes on specific SC tiers and information flows to key stakeholders) and vertical (i.e. covers knowledge about all companies and input and output flows in the SC) (Wognum et al. 2011 Wu, J., and H.-D. Hassis. 2013. “Converting Knowledge into Sustainability Performance of Freight Villages.” Logistics Research 6 (2/3): 63–88.10.1007/s12159-013-0098-0 [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ). Thus, transparency plays a significant role in GrSCM and collaborative ventures and is a widely accepted phenomenon (Ramanathan 2012 Ramanathan, U. 2012. “Supply Chain Collaboration for Improved Forecast Accuracy of Promotional Sales.” International Journal of Operations & Production Management 32 (6): 676–695.10.1108/01443571211230925 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ).\n3.2.5. Technological dimension\n•\nSupply Chain Integration (SCI): Farooq and O’Brien ( 2012 Farooq, S., and C. O’Brien. 2012. “A Technology Selection Framework for Integrating Manufacturing within a Supply Chain.” International Journal of Production Research 50 (11): 2987–3010.10.1080/00207543.2011.588265 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) report that, in realising global transformation and competitive business environments over the years, a number of manufacturing sector organisations have collaborated with their SC partners such as suppliers and customers in order to achieve seamless SC integration. In line with Cassivi’s ( 2006 Carbon Trust, 2006. Carbon Footprint in the Supply Chain: The Next Step for Business. Report No. CTC616. London: Carbon Trust.  [Google Scholar] ) empirical research, the level of supply chain integration (internally) and virtual collaboration within the SC resulted in greater significance towards organisational performance. In the context of green SC practices, Azevedo, Carvalho, and Cruz Machado ( 2011 Autry, C. W. 2011. Collaboration in the Supply Chain: Getting Things Done beyond the Four Walls. Accessed September 2, 2013. http://www.scmr.com/article/collaboration_in_the_supply_chain_getting_things_done_beyond_the_four_walls   [Google Scholar] ) assert that for organisations implementing green SC collaboration practices, it is vital to assess their impact on overall SC performance. This is because it may enable management to understanding SC partners’ integration better, while at the same time enlightening the effects of policies and likely prospects in SCM. Thus, integrating the SC facilitates streamlining the mutual (as well as individual) objectives of all the trading partners to achieve the common goal of enhancing productivity and environmental performance (Stevens and Johnson 2016 Stock, J. R., S. L. Boyer, and T. Harmon. 2010. “Research Opportunities in Supply Chain Management.” Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science 38 (1): 32–41.10.1007/s11747-009-0136-2 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). The latter concept is supported by Zhang and Huo (2013) Zhu, Q., and J. Sarkis. 2004. “Relationships between Operational Practices and Performance among Early Adopters of Green Supply Chain Management Practices in Chinese Manufacturing Enterprises.” Journal of Operations Management 22 (3): 265–289.10.1016/j.jom.2004.01.005 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] who are convinced that SCI results in sharing knowledge, dilemmas and functioning collaboratively and this does not only benefit the customers but also benefits the whole SC in developing mutual understanding, interdependence and trust and eradication of a blame culture.\n•\nSupply Chain Systems Information Quality (SCSIQ): Collaborative knowledge management practices such as knowledge creation, storage, accessibility, diffusion and application of information drive better assimilation between SC partners, resulting in improved knowledge accessibility and information quality (Li, Tarafdar, and Rao 2012 Kudla, N. L., and T. Klaas-Wissing. 2012. “Sustainability in Shipper-logistics Service Provider Relationships: A Tentative Taxonomy Based on Agency Theory and Stimulus-response Analysis.” Journal of Purchasing & Supply Management 18 (4): 218–231.10.1016/j.pursup.2012.04.001 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). To ensure that SC systems provide quality output and sustainable environmental performance, Patil et al. ( 2012 Patil, B. T., B. E. Narkhede, S. K. Mahajan, and A. P. Joshi. 2012. “Performance Evaluation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems in India Manufacturing Industries.” International Journal of Research in Management & Technology 2 (1): 72–75.  [Google Scholar] ) argue that organisations need to evaluate their information systems. Irani et al. (2014) Irani, Z., and A. M. Sharif. 2016. “Sustainable Food Security Futures: Perspectives on Food Waste and Information across the Food Supply Chain.” Journal of Enterprise Information Management 29 (2): 1–9. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] report that this examination can be conducted in terms of performance and profitability, quality output and ease of customisation, implementation time, cost, customer satisfaction and overall greening of the SC. Many researchers have examined the role of SC information and information quality in improving SC performance. For example, Raymond, Croteau, and Bergeron (2011) Raymond, L., and F. Bergeron. 2008. “Enabling the Business Strategy of SMEs through E-Business Capabilities: A Strategic Alignment Perspective.” Industrial Management & Data Systems 108 (5): 577–595. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] identified that quality information outcome and performance from inter-organisational SC systems is viewed as a result of direct or proximal strategic alignment of IT. Forslund and Jonsson ( 2007 Forslund, H., and P. Jonsson. 2007. “The Impact of Forecast Information Quality on Supply Chain Performance.” International Journal of Operations & Production Management 27 (1): 90–107.10.1108/01443570710714556 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) however, report that for upstream SC members (specifically the manufacture-to-order suppliers) forecast information quality may be mediocre; nevertheless, Ketzenberg et al. (2006) Kara, S., and S. Ibbotson. 2011. “Embodied Energy of Manufacturing Supply Chains.” CIRP Journal of Manufacturing Science and Technology 4 (3): 317–323.10.1016/j.cirpj.2011.03.006 [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] argue that managing the information efficiently will certainly improve the SC performance.\n•\nSupply Chain Collaboration Design (SCCD): A number of research studies provide extensive understanding into the operational and strategic aspects of SC design and management. For instance, SCC has often been associated with the design of inter-organisational process enhancements combined with information systems, which enable the SC members to efficiently deliver products and services to customers cost-effectively (Bhattacharjee and Mohanty 2012 Bezuidenhout, C. N., S. Bodhanya, and L. Brenchley. 2012. “An Analysis of Collaboration in a Sugarcane Production and Processing Supply Chain.” British Food Journal 114 (6): 880–895.10.1108/00070701211234390 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ; Matopoulos et al. 2007 Malhotra, A., S. Gasain, and O. Sawy. 2005. “Absorptive Capacity Configurations in Supply Chains: Gearing for Partner-enabled Market Knowledge Creation.” MIS Quarterly 29 (1): 145–187. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). Advocates such as Simatupang and Sridharan (2008) Simchi-Levi, D., P. Kaminsky, and E. Simchi-Levi. 2003. Designing and Managing the Supply Chain. 2nd ed.\nBoston\n,\nMA\n: McGraw-Hill.  [Google Scholar] emphasise that the SC processes and design should be flexible so as to respond to ever-increasing customer needs at the lowest cost regarding supply capability. Simchi-Levi, Kaminsky, and Simchi-Levi (2003) Sodhi, M., and B.-G. Son. 2009. “Supply-chain Partnership Performance.” Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review 45 (6): 937–945.10.1016/j.tre.2009.05.004 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] argue that to develop flexibility, the SC partners can restructure the SC design by streamlining the distribution system, product, production process and inventory management so as to capture knowledge and to be cost-effective and flexible enough to equal supply with varying customer demands. For instance, Dell, Zara and Toyota have reengineered their SC designs to achieve strategic objectives. In the case of Zara (an attire company), it capitalised on IT to capture knowledge on topical fashion developments and synchronise product delivery from manufacturers to retailers in a short span of 10 days. By redesigning SC structure, Zara managed to acquire a faster response, i.e. from fashion draft to product delivery in stores that resulted in improved profits and reduced costs.\n3.2.6. Human-Socio dimension\n•\nSupply Chain Members’ Commitment (SCMC): Lack of commitment from business partners and their individual members is a major challenge to SC collaborative ventures (Walker, Di Sisto, and McBain 2008 Walsham, G. 1995. “The Emergence of Interpretivism in iS Research.” Information Systems Research 6 (4): 376–394.10.1287/isre.6.4.376 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). According to Simatupang and Sridharan (2008) Simchi-Levi, D., P. Kaminsky, and E. Simchi-Levi. 2003. Designing and Managing the Supply Chain. 2nd ed.\nBoston\n,\nMA\n: McGraw-Hill.  [Google Scholar] ). A principle of trust and collaboration is that organisations and their SC trading partners have analogous aspirations and commitment to work together (Sheu, Yen, and Chae 2006 Simatupang, T. M., and R. Sridharan. 2002. “The Collaborative Supply Chain.” Business Process Management Journal 14 (3): 401–418. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ). Thus, a high level of commitment towards cooperative functioning generates outcomes that stimulate effectiveness, productivity and efficiency. Moreover, it ensures that SC partnerships have less concern over unauthorised outflow of core knowledge as well as overflow at the knowledge acquisition stage (He, Ghibadian, and Galllear 2011 He, Q., D. Gallear, and A. Ghobadian. 2011. “Knowledge Transfer: The Facilitating Attributes in Supply-Chain Partnerships.” Information Systems Management 28 (1): 57–70. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ).\n•\nEmployee Training and Education (ETE): Researchers such as McCarter, Fawcett, and Magnan (2005) McAdam, R., and D. McCormack. 2001. “Integrating Business Processes for Global Alignment and Supply Chain Management.” Business Process Management 7 (2): 113–130.10.1108/14637150110389696 [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ; Ateş et al.

Ries. 2014. “Impact of Transportation Lead-Time Variability on the Economic and Environmental Performance of Inventory Systems.” International Journal of Production Economics 157: 279–288. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] and Bhattacharjee and Mohanty ( 2012 Bezuidenhout, C. N., S. Bodhanya, and L. Brenchley. 2012. “An Analysis of Collaboration in a Sugarcane Production and Processing Supply Chain.” British Food Journal 114 (6): 880–895.10.1108/00070701211234390 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) highlight the significance of employee training and education and state that organisations providing training and learning facilities to their employees may facilitate collaborative supply chain ventures. Gunasekaran and Ngai ( 2004) Gunasekaran, A., and E. W. T. Ngai. 2004. “Information Systems in Supply Chain Integration and Management.” European Journal of Operational Research 159 (2): 269–295.10.1016/j.ejor.2003.08.016 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] report that training and education are dynamic constituents of the continuing success of an organisation and in successfully transiting the change process. In the context of SC partnerships, the change process generates vital information and to convert such information to knowledge and further manage that knowledge efficiently and effectively, employee training and education becomes a strategic need (McCarter, Fawcett, and Magnan 2005 McAdam, R., and D. McCormack. 2001. “Integrating Business Processes for Global Alignment and Supply Chain Management.” Business Process Management 7 (2): 113–130.10.1108/14637150110389696 [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ). Moreover, for organisations to be successful, it is important that managers have the full support of their knowledgeable and experienced employees to ensure success in SCs (Irani et al. 2014 Irani, Z., and A. M. Sharif. 2016. “Sustainable Food Security Futures: Perspectives on Food Waste and Information across the Food Supply Chain.” Journal of Enterprise Information Management 29 (2): 1–9. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). This indicates that SCC entails more than a change in attitude from antagonistic to collaborative green organisational interactivity where training and education provide employees with a vision and understanding to yield benefits. Senge ( 2000 Senge, P. 2000. “The Leader’s New Work: Building Leaning Organizations.” In Knowledge Management: Classic and Contemporary Works, edited by D. Morey, M. Maybury and B. Thuraisingham, 19–52. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.  [Google Scholar] ) describes such organisations as learning organisations – where the workforce is constantly acquiring knowledge and improving their competences to support their organisation in adapting to vibrant global environments and remain competitively superior.\n•\nInterpersonal Trust (IT): Trust in SC partnerships is conceivably one of the most frequently cited requisites and foundations of the SCM philosophy (e.g. Anbanandam, Banwet, and Shankar 2011 Amin, S. H., and G. Zhang. 2012. “An Integrated Model for Closed-loop Supply Chain Configuration and Supplier Selection: Multi-Objective Approach.” Expert Systems with Applications 39 (15): 6782–6791.10.1016/j.eswa.2011.12.056 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ; Bezuidenhout, Bodhanya, and Brenchley 2012 Beulens, A. J. M., D.-F. Broens, P. Folstar, and G. J. Hofstede. 2005. “Food Safety and Transparency in Food Chains and Networks Relationships and Challenges.” Food Control 16 (6): 481–486.10.1016/j.foodcont.2003.10.010 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ; Chae, Yen, and Sheu 2005 Cervellon, M.-C., and A.-S. Wernerfelt. 2012. “Knowledge Sharing among Green Fashion Communities Online Lessons for the Sustainable Supply Chain.” Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management 16 (2): 176–192.10.1108/13612021211222860 [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ; Sheu, Yen, and Chae 2006 Simatupang, T. M., and R. Sridharan. 2002. “The Collaborative Supply Chain.” Business Process Management Journal 14 (3): 401–418. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ). Wekselberg (1996) Wognum, P. M., H. Bremmers, J. H. Trienekens, J. G. A. J. van der Vorst, and J. M. Bloemhof. 2011. “Systems for Sustainability and Transparency of Food Supply Chains – Current Status and Challenges.” Advanced Engineering Informatics 25 (1): 65–76.10.1016/j.aei.2010.06.001 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] defines trust as ‘beliefs that participants of an interaction share common goals and together pursue these goals’. In management and operation literature there has been an evident upsurge in the significance of trust in different forms of inter-organisational affiliations. For example, for some researchers, interpersonal trust nurtures greater teamwork and knowledge creation, decreases functional encounters and improves integration in addition to decision-making under ambiguity and uncertain conditions (Anbanandam, Banwet, and Shankar 2011 Amin, S. H., and G. Zhang. 2012. “An Integrated Model for Closed-loop Supply Chain Configuration and Supplier Selection: Multi-Objective Approach.” Expert Systems with Applications 39 (15): 6782–6791.10.1016/j.eswa.2011.12.056 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ), whereas, others cite that interpersonal trust is the binding force of any buyer–supplier relationship (Sheu, Yen, and Chae 2006 Simatupang, T. M., and R. Sridharan. 2002. “The Collaborative Supply Chain.” Business Process Management Journal 14 (3): 401–418. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ). In the latter case, for instance, when the supply of a product is reduced, the farmer may demand higher rates. Similarly, when the supply of a product is augmented, the processor may demand a lower rate. In both these cases, the trust development process is affected as organisations start focusing on short-term benefits. The overall exercise of supply and demand places pressure on the partnership development process, further jeopardising the intensity of green alliance, and explicitly the depth of relationship from strategic to functional and tactical.\n3.2.7. Financial dimension\n•\nSupply Chain Cost and Risks (SCCR): Organisations are depending more on external associates and partners to enable cost-effective value and service delivery to customers, as the pertinent knowledge is often found in other SC partners (Naspettia et al. 2011 Min, S., A. S. Roath, P. J. Daugherty, S. E. Genchev, H. Chen, and A. D. Arndt. 2005. “Supply Chain Collaboration: What is Happening?” International Journal of Logistics Management 16 (2): 237–256.10.1108/09574090510634539 [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ).

Kodali. 2012. “Evaluating Reliability and Validity of Lean, Agile and Leagile Supply Chain Constructs in Indian Manufacturing Industry.” Production Planning & Control 23 (10–11): 864–884.10.1080/09537287.2011.642207 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] and Bhattacharjee and Mohanty ( 2012 Bezuidenhout, C. N., S. Bodhanya, and L. Brenchley. 2012. “An Analysis of Collaboration in a Sugarcane Production and Processing Supply Chain.” British Food Journal 114 (6): 880–895.10.1108/00070701211234390 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) state that organisations practicing an SCC approach and knowledge and information sharing with their SC partners have realised significant cost reductions and increased revenues. Wuttke, Blome, and Henke (2013) Zahay, D. L., and R. B. Handfield. 2004. “The Role of Learning and Technical Capabilities in Prediction Adoption of B2B Technologies.” Industrial Marketing Management 33 (7): 627–641.10.1016/j.indmarman.2003.10.004 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] specify that collaboration contributes to greater SC performance by reducing an organisation’s logistical service-related costs and improving cash flow. However, as most collaborations take place virtually – in this case global SC can increase efficiency and effectiveness, but it can also result in increased risks. For example, the recent cases of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami and the volcano in Iceland – clearly indicate the how far the magnitude of such risks to the environment can spread. In the Japanese tremor case, for instance, the global SC electronics production line and dissemination was severely affected and this natural calamity led to prolonged business interruptions for the automotive businesses worldwide. The instability of global SC is associated with the evolving nature of risks; however, it is also linked to SC design strategies (Simatupang and Sridharan 2008 Simchi-Levi, D., P. Kaminsky, and E. Simchi-Levi. 2003. Designing and Managing the Supply Chain. 2nd ed.\nBoston\nDimension\nFactors\nSakka, Millet, and Botta-Genoulaz ( 2011 Sakka, O., P. A. Millet, and V.

"""UCL""","""Iris Publication""","""http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1557223/\nAbstract\nThis paper proposes that there has been an evolving pattern of urban transport policy and planning in many Western cities, which has been associated with changes in mobility patterns and attitudes to different transport modes and to city living in general. Looking over the past 50 year period, a three-stage transport policy development cycle is proposed, starting with Stage 1 – a rapid increase in car ownership and use in Western cities from the 1950s, often associated with the growth of a domestic car industry. This led to a policy response that involved catering for vehicle use by building urban motorways and large car parks, reducing investment in public transport and with more negative attitudes towards cycling and walking. After some time the negative aggregate consequences of increasing car use and provision become widely apparent, through increasing congestion, air pollution, traffic accidents, etc. Now the policy priority switches in Stage 2 - from accommodating motor vehicles to providing for people movement, particularly through improvements to public transport. Beijing has recently made this transition, with a 5 year programme to build 550 km of new metro lines, instead of further increasing road capacity. Several cities (e.g. London and Copenhagen) have moved beyond this to a Stage 3 in which the priority is to provide a liveable city with a focus on activity and interaction, in which car traffic is reduced, some elevated roads are demolished and roadspace is reallocated to sustainable modes of transport and to provide enhanced public space. Finally, the paper considers whether developing cities that are in Stage 1 and experiencing rapid motorisation could learn from this evolutionary model: 1. By ensuring that they do not promote land use polices which may lead to a ‘lock-in’ that prevents evolution beyond a car-based city, and 2. By compressing the development cycle – speeding up the implementation of more sustainable transport policies and avoiding wasted investment in roads-based infrastructure.\nPublication data is maintained in RPS.

The cost structure of the railway industry is analysed using a stochastic frontier approach estimated within the framework of a translog cost system. The results confirm that European railways experience significant cost increases due to inefficient behaviour. In contrast to previous studies, however, the estimates indicate a much greater role for allocative rather than technical inefficiency. Overall, inefficiencies can essentially be explained by the supply of excess capacity and by the over-employment of labour inputs. Regarding productivity, it appears to be technological progress, and not levels of efficiency or scale economies, that provide the most convincing explanation for variance in growth rates within the sample.\nArticle Metrics\n""","1.0","""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036840801949782""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

Several operating modes can be achieved by changing the on-off states of the switches in the front-end circuit. In generator driving mode, the battery bank is employed to elevate the phase voltage for fast excitation and demagnetization. In battery driving mode, the converter is reconfigured as a four-level converter, and the capacitor is used as an additional charge capacitor to produce multilevel voltage outputs, which enhances the torque capability. The operating modes of the proposed drive are explained and the phase current and voltage are analyzed in details. The battery charging is naturally achieved by the demagnetization current in motoring mode and by the regenerative current in braking mode. Moreover, the battery can be charged by the external AC source or generator through the proposed converter when the vehicle is in standstill condition. The SRM-based PHEV can operate at different speeds by coordinating the power flow between the generator and battery. Simulation in MATLAB/Simulink and experiments on a three-phase 12/8 SRM confirm the effectiveness of the proposed converter topology.\nDocuments\nIntegrated multilevel converter for switched reluctance motor drives\nRights statement: © 2016 IEEE.

"""Aston_University""","""The use of ICT by logistics service providers and implications for training needs - Research Explorer : Aston University""","""Edward Sweeney ORCiD: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8389-4446\nAbstract\nChanges in the international economic scenario in recent years have made it necessary for both industrial and service firms to reformulate their strategies, with a strong focus on the resources required for successful implementation. In this scenario, information and communication technologies (ICT) has a potentially vital role to play both as a key resource for re-engineering business processes within a framework of direct connection between suppliers and customers, and as a source of cost optimisation. There have also been innovations in the logistics and freight transport industry in relation to ICT diffusion. The implementation of such systems by third party logistics providers (3PL) allows the real-time exchange of information between supply chain partners, thereby improving planning capability and customer service. Unlike other industries, the logistics and freight transport industry is lagging somewhat behind other sectors in ICT diffusion. This situation is to be attributed to a series of both industry-specific and other factors, such as: (a) traditional resistance to change on the part of transport and logistics service providers; (b) the small size of firms that places considerable constraints upon investment in ICT; (c) the relative shortage of user-friendly applications; (d) the diffusion of internal standards on the part of the main providers in the industry whose aim is to protect company information, preventing its dissemination among customers and suppliers; (e) the insufficient degree of professional skills for using such technologies on the part of staff in such firms. The latter point is of critical importance insofar as the adoption of ICT is making it increasingly necessary both to develop new technical skills to use different hardware and new software tools, and to be able to plan processes of communication so as to allow the optimal use of ICT. The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of ICT on transport and logistics industry and to highlight how the use of such new technologies is affecting providers' training needs. The first part will provide a conceptual framework of the impact of ICT on the transport and logistics industry. In the second part the state of ICT dissemination in the Italian and Irish third party logistics industry will be outlined. In the third part, the impact of ICT on the training needs of transport and logistics service providers - based on case studies in both countries - are discussed.

The current analysis mainly compares current and historic incident rates and, for each type of incident, looks at the railway as a whole. However, changes to reduce risk are often made locally, at least at first, so a modelling approach is needed that is able to analyse local risk. In this paper we present a form of model that is able to make local risk estimates from incident data, using a case study – boarding and alighting incidents at stations. Using a Bayesian network (BN), we analyse the incident data with expert judgements about causal factors. The BN cannot be directly leant from data because the dataset contains no entries for the overwhelming majority of cases where the railway is used without incident. Instead, the incident data is analysed in the context of a model of the use of the railway, so that the prevalence of the causal factors in normal use can be compared with that in the incident data. The usage model is derived from multiple data sets; the use of a BN allows this to be done with approximations. Finally, we show how the model allows local risk to be estimated and consider the wider applicability of the techniques described.\nReferences\n""","1.0","""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0954409713498381""","[-0.040532,51.52341]"

Bio-oil can be stored and transported so it is possible to decouple the pyrolysis process from the generation process. This allows each process to be separately optimised. It is necessary to have an understanding of the transport costs involved in order to carry out techno-economic assessments of combinations of remote pyrolysis plants and generation plants. Published fixed and variable costs for freight haulage have been used to calculate the transport cost for trucks running between field stores and a pyrolysis plant. It was found that the key parameter for estimating these costs was the number of round trips a day a truck could make rather than the distance covered. This zone costing approach was used to estimate the transport costs for a range of pyrolysis plants size for willow woodchips and baled miscanthus. The possibility of saving transport costs by producing bio-oil near to the field stores and transporting the bio-oil to a central plant was investigated and it was found that this would only be cost effective for large generation plants.\nDetails\nmiscanthus, willow, transport fast pyrolysis bio-oil, biomass supply networks\nDOI\n""","0.029557627","""https://research.aston.ac.uk/portal/en/researchoutput/analysis-of-transport-costs-for-energy-crops-for-use-in-biomass-pyrolysis-plant-networks(1d8631e2-04c4-4a61-9d3d-9b3b4b1726ea).html""","[-1.888803,52.487018]"

The literature shows that train drivers, signalers, and controllers most affect network safety. Several studies have been conducted in the field of human factors and human performance in the railway domain to investigate operators' influence on the railway system. However, most studies are based on previous studies from other domains, which are not well suited and can be difficult to apply reliably to railway-specific operations. In light of the current limitations, this paper proposes a new approach referred to as the human performance railway operational index (HuPeROI). HuPeROI aims not only to estimate the human error probability for railway operations but also to propose mitigation strategies to minimize phenomena such as operators' degraded performance. HuPeROI is based on a performance-shaping factors taxonomy designed for the rail industry, referred to as the railway performance-shaping factor (R-PSF) taxonomy. The R-PSF taxonomy was developed on the basis of an extensive literature review of the field of human factors and subsequently validated against the findings derived from the analysis of 179 railway accident and incident reports, as well as targeted interviews with subject matter experts. This paper presents the taxonomy and the underlying theory, as well as the results of the validation process based on the analysis of 179 reports and the assessment of R-PSFs for four different scenarios based on a subject matter expert elicitation process. The R-PSF taxonomy and HuPeROI should enable researchers to address and deal with the effect of degraded performance of railway operators.\n< >\nTransportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board\nTransportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board\nPrint ISSN: 0361-1981\n""","1.0","""http://trrjournalonline.trb.org/doi/10.3141/2289-19""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

A consideration of the issues associated with the introduction of emission control areas\nPDF\nAbstract\nThis paper draws upon original research undertaken in the United Kingdom and Sweden. It considers the enforcement of regulations associated with the limitation of air emissions from shipping. Specifically, it considers the enforcement of regulations pertaining to the Baltic and North Sea emission control areas (ECAs). The paper outlines the steps that have been taken to ensure vessel compliance in these ECAs. It describes the effectiveness of such enforcement as well as current limitations and gives specific emphasis to the views of vessel operators. The paper ends with a series of recommendations that have been arrived at following discussion of the research findings with a select group of industry experts.\nKeywords: regulation ,  globalisation ,  ports ,  pollution ,  environment ,  emissions\nBackground\nThe latter half of the twentieth century saw increased interest amongst academics in the problem of the environment, not least how to reconcile economic, social and environmental interests (Dobson 1996 Dobson, A. 1996. “The Green Scene: Academics on the Environment.” Sociology 30 (2): 395–403. doi:10.1177/0038038596030002013. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] , 395). Within the maritime field concern with pollution, and the potential for shipping business to negatively impact on the marine environment and related biodiversity, has also grown. Marine pollution in the form of oil and chemical spills has attracted much media attention in the last 30 years as high profile incidents taking place in European waters (e.g. oil spills from the Sea Empress, Braer, Erika and Prestige) or particularly sensitive environments (e.g. Exxon Valdez) have hit the headlines. It has also attracted the attention of academics concerned to offer insight into risk mitigation and the role of regulation and of good governance in mitigating such impacts. For example, Radović et al. ( 2012 Radović, J., D. Rial, B. Lyons, C. Harman, L. Viñas, R. Beiras, J. Readman, K. Thomas, and J. Bayona. 2012. “Post-Incident Monitoring to Evaluate Environmental Damage from Shipping Incidents: Chemical and Biological Assessments.” Journal of Environmental Management 109 (Oct): 136–153. doi:10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.04.042. [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) offer an analysis of the best strategies for the detection and assessment of oil and chemical spills arising from shipping incidents in support of more effective damage limitation, whereas Xu ( 2009 Xu, J. 2009. “‘The Law and Economics of Pollution Damage Arising from Carriage of Oil by Sea.” Maritime Policy & Management 36 (4): 309–323. doi:10.1080/03088830903056942. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) offers an analysis of liability in the event of pollution damage at sea. In the face of increased public and policy concerns, the shipping industry has sought actively to curtail the negative environmental externalities arising within the shipping sector, in particular that of marine pollution. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has dedicated annex VI of the MARPOL convention to regulations concerned with the limitation of air pollution including, but not exclusively, CO2 emissions. Regulation 14 is specifically concerned with the regulation of sulphur dioxide (SOx) and particulate matter, and in 2006, 2007, and 2012, emission control areas (ECAs) restricting the emission of SOx were established in the Baltic, North Sea, and North American zones, respectively. While the pollution restrictions that were initially established by MARPOL were originally considered to be ineffective with regard to environmental impact by some commentators (Ringbom 1999 Ringbom, H. 1999. “Preventing Pollution from Ships – Reflections on the ‘Adequacy’ of Existing Rules.” Reciel 8 (1): 21–28.  [Google Scholar] ) plans to restrict sulphur levels to 0.1% by 2015 in ECAs are thought by some to represent a ‘step change’ in practice.\nThese developments have been followed with some interest in the trade and wider press and they have continued to remain central to the news agenda (see for recent examples Green 2011 Green, R. 2011. “In the Greening of Our Seas Speed Is of the Essence.” Asian Conversations. Accessed February 18. http://www.asianconversations.com/GreenShipping.php   [Google Scholar] ; Eilperin 2012 Eilperin, J. (2012) “Cruise Ship Lines, Alaska Officials Question New Air Pollution Limits.” Washington Post 22 July.

They have also provided the focus for research in the academic community of a largely business oriented/technical nature. For example, Eide et al. have considered the cost-effectiveness of different measures which act to reduce CO2 emissions. They conclude that according to the criteria they establish, ‘several measures are cost effective’ (Eide et al. 2009 Eide, M., Ø. Endresen, R. Skjong, T. Longva, and S. Alvik. 2009. “Cost-Effectiveness Assessment of CO2 Reducing Measures in Shipping.” Maritime Policy & Management 36 (4): 367–384. doi:10.1080/03088830903057031. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 381), depending on the price of fuel, but that at the time of publication these excluded the use of solar panels, fuel cells and waste heat recovery due to the initial high investment costs associated with such technologies. In a similar vein, Longva and colleagues have considered energy efficiency design indexes (EEDI) and the establishment of associated targets (Longva, Eide, and Skjong 2010 Longva, T., M. Eide, and R. Skjong. 2010. “Determining a Required Energy Efficiency Design Index Level for New Ships Based on a Cost-Effectiveness Criterion.” Maritime Policy & Management 37 (2): 129–143. doi:10.1080/03088830903533759. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ); Notteboom ( 2011 Notteboom, T. 2011. “The Impact of Low Sulphur Fuel Requirements in Shipping on the Competitiveness of Roro Shipping in Northern Europe.” WMU Journal of Maritime Affairs 10: 63–95. doi:10.1007/s13437-010-0001-7. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ) has considered the relationship between the use of low-sulphur fuel and competitiveness in the ro-ro sector; and Schinas and Stefanakos ( 2012 Schinas, O., and C. Stefanakos. 2012. “Cost Assessment of Environmental Regulation and Options for Marine Operators.” Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies 25: 81–99. doi:10.1016/j.trc.2012.05.002. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) consider the economic and business implications of sulphur regulations.\nThis paper is written from a rather different perspective. In relation to any maritime regulatory regime, one of the concerns for ship operators is that regulations serve to create a ‘level playing field’ whereby socially responsible operators are not penalised for voluntary compliance with regulation whilst less scrupulous operators establish competitive advantage via regulatory avoidance. It is therefore essential that new regulations relating to the requirement for vessels to use expensive low sulphur fuel in specific ocean zones are effectively enforced. With its strong emphasis on the enforcement of emissions regulation, this paper therefore considers some of the issues that have arisen in conjunction with efforts to control air emissions in the North Sea and Baltic ECAs. It outlines the steps that have been taken to enforce compliance with the requirements of the ECAs and describes the limitations on the effectiveness of such enforcement. The paper further considers the responses of the industry to the introduction of ECAs and highlights the problems that some companies have had in ensuring compliance. It ends with some policy recommendations which have been arrived at following discussion of the research findings with a select group of industry experts (termed a Delphi group).\nThe regulation of deep-sea shipping\nIn the twentieth century, the international shipping industry became increasingly regulated such that by 2013 two main bodies—the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the International Labour Organisation (ILO)—were responsible for formulating the bulk of international regulation pertaining to shipping. Such international regulations were developed in addition to those introduced by specific nation states and regional bodies such as the European Union.\nThe same period witnessed the increased ascendance of the transnational corporation and the phenomenon that is termed globalisation. Globalising processes are described as those that free capital from the confines of national boundaries (Held et al. 1999 Held, D., A. McGrew, D. Goldblatt, and J. Perraton. 1999. Global Transformations: Politics, Economics, and Culture. Cambridge: Polity Press.  [Google Scholar] ) producing ‘footloose’ capital that is free to ‘scour the world’ for cheap sources of labour (Hirst and Thompson 1999 Hirst, P., and G. Thompson. 1999. Glabalisation in Question. 2nd ed. Cambridge: Polity Press.  [Google Scholar] ). In shipping, globalisation can be seen to have taken place with the flagging-out of national fleets to open registers (Sampson 2013 Sampson, H. 2013. International Seafarers and Transnationalism in the Twenty-First Century. Manchester: Manchester University Press.  [Google Scholar] ). As such, by 2012, 57% of the world fleet was registered with the 10 largest open registers (UNCTAD 2012 UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). 2012. Review of Maritime Transport 2012. New York: United Nations Publication. ISBN 978-92-1-112860-4, ISSN 0566-7682.  [Google Scholar] ). Such flagging-out was undertaken in pursuit of competitive advantage (Bergantino and Marlow 1997 Bergantino, A., and P. Marlow. 1997. An Econometric Analysis of the Decision to Flag Out. Cardiff: SIRC.  [Google Scholar] ) achieved as a result of freedom to recruit cheap labour from developing countries and regulatory avoidance (Alderton et al. 2004 Alderton, T., M. Bloor, E. Kahveci, T. Lane, H. Sampson, M. Thomas, N. Winchester, B. Wu, and M. Zhao. 2004. The Global Seafarer: Living and Working Conditions in a Globalised Industry. Geneva: ILO.  [Google Scholar] ).\nAs a result of globalisation, and in spite of the expansion of the regulatory scope of the IMO in particular, the enforcement of international regulations pertaining to shipping has presented considerable challenges to those seeking to retain control over the industry. As ships flagged-out, the traditional means for enforcing regulations relating to shipping, via flag states, was eroded. New open registers were seen to exercise little regulatory control over their fleets (Donaldson 2007 Donaldson, L. (2007) “Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas: Report of Lord Donaldson’s Inquiry into the Prevention of Pollution from Merchant Shipping.” House of Commons Parliamentary Papers Online.  [Google Scholar] ) and a series of shipping disasters with a considerable financial impact on tourism and aquaculture increased political concerns about marine governance and in particular standards pertaining to international vessels. The response by the IMO was to agree mechanisms by which nation states (also termed for this purpose port states) ratifying international regulations were free to enforce related standards in relation to all vessels calling at their ports rather than simply their own fleet of registered vessels. Port state control, as this was termed, came into its own in the latter part of the twentieth century as regional groups of port states began to collaborate with regard to inspection and the targeting of vessels for inspection. For example, the Paris Memorandum of Understanding was established amongst 14 participating states in 1982. It has subsequently grown to include 27 states and has been regarded as particularly effective in establishing higher standards for shipping and something akin to a ‘culture of compliance’ amongst operators whose vessels visit European ports (Bloor et al. 2013c). The website for the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on port state control describes the purpose of port state control as follows:\nPort state control is a check on visiting foreign ships to see that they comply with international rules on safety, pollution prevention and seafarers living and working conditions. It is a means of enforcing compliance where the owner and flag State have failed in their responsibility to implement or ensure compliance. The port State can require defects to be put right, and detain the ship for this purpose if necessary. It is therefore also a port State’s defence against visiting substandard shipping. http://www.parismou.org/organization/about_us/2010.12.28/Principles.htm accessed 28/05/2013\nThis broad regulatory overview provides the backdrop for the research described herein relating to the specific enforcement of pollution controls in European waters in the period 2010–2012. 1 1.  The paper does not focus on regulation of bunker suppliers per se which may be fertile ground for future investigation. This paper is concerned with the broader enforcement of regulations pertaining to ship emissions. View all notes\nMethods\nThe research which underpins this paper was funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council. It was undertaken in the period 2010–2012. The research considered both the North Sea and Baltic ECAs and, as such, fieldwork was focussed in both Sweden and the United Kingdom. In total 50 recorded semi-structured interviews were conducted with port state inspectors, regulators, ship operators and other key industry stakeholders. These augmented the fieldnotes that were made in the course of 16 ship inspections which were observed by researchers at 7 different port state control offices in the United Kingdom and Sweden. In addition, researchers analysed the records of Falmouth bunker deliveries, results of fuel sample tests taken in Sweden and Holland, the records of a large commercial fuel testing company and the results of a company in-house survey relating to the fleet experience of fuel sampling and testing by statutory authorities.\nA slightly different interview schedule was utilised in relation to each group of interviewees (e.g. regulators vs. ship operators) and the overall responses of each group of interviewees were compared with each other augmenting the initial intra-group analysis. Recorded interviews were transcribed and coded. Initial analysis and interpretation was augmented using the established technique of analytic induction (Cressey 1953 Cressey, D. 1953. Other People’s Money: A Study in the Social Psychology of Embezzlement. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.  [Google Scholar] ; Bloor 1978 Bloor, M. 1978. “On the Analysis of Observational Data: A Discussion of the Worth and Uses of Inductive Techniques and Respondent Validation.” Sociology 12: 545–552. doi:10.1177/003803857801200307. [Crossref] , [PubMed]   [Google Scholar] ). In this system, searches are made for deviant cases that do not fit with a working ‘hypothesis’ and these are considered in relation to the need to modify and extend the conclusions in order to deepen the analysis. Thus, in this paper we report the findings to reflect the nuances in the expressed views of stakeholders. Initially the coding of transcripts was undertaken manually by Bloor. Subsequently, in re-considering the findings in relation to the issues reported here, the transcripts were re-analysed and coded with the assistance of the software programme NVIVO by Sampson. In line with standard practice amongst qualitative researchers, no attempt is made here to quantify these data as this would not be appropriate. Thus, no ‘trends’ or statistics are reported as such. The transcripts from the study have been anonymised and placed in the ESRC archive where they can be referenced for re-evaluation and confirmation.\nTowards the end of the research phase of the project, key findings were presented to a panel of experts (an electronic ‘Delphi group’) with the intention of arriving at a consensus relating to recommendations arising from the research. The Delphi group comprised one ship operator manager, one regulator, one port state control officer and one member of an environmental NGO. The recommendations which emerged as a result of this process are presented at the end of the paper and the process itself is further discussed in Bloor et al. ( 2013b Bloor, M., S. Baker, H. Sampson, and K. Dahlgren. 2013b. “Useful but No Oracle: Reflections on the Use of a Delphi Group in a Multi-Methods Policy Research Study.” Qualitative Research. doi:10.1177/1468794113504103. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ).\nThe enforcement of regulations pertaining to emission control areas\nWithin the ECAs, an initial limit on the sulphur content of fuel was set at 1.5%. This reduced to 1% in July 2010 and it is set to be reduced further (to just 0.1%) in January 2015. Further to this, since January 2010, all vessels calling at EU ports have been required to burn fuel with a sulphur content of just 0.1% whilst at anchor within port limits or at berth. Where operators prefer, sulphur abatement technology may be deployed (in the form of scrubbers) as an alternative to the purchase and consumption of the relatively highly priced low-sulphur fuel.\nThe enforcement of the regulations relating to air pollution in the ECAs has been undertaken by port state control officers. Two primary methods have been adopted: the examination of paper records such as vessel log books and bunker fuel delivery notes and the analysis of fuel samples. Fuel samples are not extensively used however and in 2010 just 149 samples were analysed in Sweden. Other EU countries (e.g. Netherlands, Germany, Denmark) analyse similarly small numbers of samples annually whilst the United Kingdom does not generally make use of fuel sample analysis in its enforcement of air-pollution regulation.\nIn addition, experiments have been conducted with the analysis of samples taken from vessel exhaust plumes using aircraft and lasers mounted at the entrance to the port of Gothenburg. Whilst the Swedish Maritime Authority has discontinued its use of aircraft-mounted laser monitoring equipment, there is some evidence that such experiments have had a deterrent effect.\nIn Sweden, an incentives programme is in place such that more favourable fairway dues 2 2.  Fairway dues are charged to defray the costs of ice-breaking and coastal lights. View all notes (and to a lesser extent port charges) are levied from vessels demonstrating constant use of low-sulphur fuel. This measure complements and encourages compliance with low-sulphur fuel regulations but it does not substitute for local enforcement.\nProblems for enforcement\nThe research highlighted several problems in relation to enforcement of the regulations. Of greatest concern is the difficulty for port state control officers in identifying fraudulent paperwork where this may exist. Bunker fuel delivery notes are generally checked in conjunction with log books in order to ascertain compliance with fuel usage in ECAs. As one port state control inspector described it, inspectors examine:\nMostly bunker delivery notes, which proves what type of bunker they are using and then you have the log book entry for the change over because normally they will burn high sulphur outside the ECA area. So when they are coming in, so like what time they change over. [Inspector]\nA second port state inspector confirmed this with his account:\nWe will be checking the bunker delivery note, it will be cross checking with oil record book, 2 entries. If the vessel is coming into the ECA area from outside, so then you would like to see the log book entries about the change over things, obviously change over time is depending on the type of the ship, type of engine and the arrangement of change over, also the capacity of the, if they are using the same bunker tank, service tank, then the capacity of the service tank and how long it will take, so there are some calculations to verify that they are burning the compliant fuel when they are inside the ECA, so that has to be demonstrated. [Inspector]\nSulphur levels on bunker delivery notes are often hand written and are frequently illegible (not least because the carbon copy deteriorates in storage), whilst log books are open to inaccuracy. An inspector explained his concerns as follows:\nI think the regulation for this bunker […] is not fully implemented in this country because I think you will find [in] foreign countries […] all this [is] closely controlled and monitored, which is not the case here. [Inspector]\nReliance on the checking of paperwork may not, as a result, be adequate in the face of deliberate contravention of regulations by unscrupulous ship operators. Furthermore, vessels which are transiting the ECAs rather than calling at ports within them may not be subject to such inspections and could escape detection.\nIn order to detect contravention of the regulations, by vessels transiting an ECA, the use of laser monitoring equipment might appear to be ideal, although thus far the intention has only been to use this technology as a screening device to identify potential candidates for fuel sampling and testing. As previously noted, experiments with airborne laser detection equipment have been discontinued. This was due to the hazards presented to aircraft in attempting to capture samples from vessel plumes. Such technical problems are compounded by the relatively high cost of such measures although the presence of ‘sniffer planes’ sends a powerful message to vessels and could act as a very useful deterrent.\nFinally in relation to the sampling of fuel, there are a couple of problems which are worth noting. The first issue relates to the time which is generally taken when samples are sent away to independent laboratories for testing. By the time that the results of the sample analysis are available to port state control officers, it is highly likely that a vessel will have sailed. Some port state control officers have access to fuel testing procedures that offer them rapid results. However, in the United Kingdom it was reported that such samples were rarely, if ever, taken. An inspector commented that:\n[…] they tell me that they get, once they reach the continent places like Germany in particular and to a lesser extent Denmark and Holland, they are having samples of their service tanks taken, and they some of them have been taken to court and they feel it is over the top, but as far as anything about what we do here none at all. [Inspector]\nThe response of ship operators to the introduction of ECAs and problems of compliance\nIncentives to avoid regulation\nA major financial incentive currently exists with regard to the avoidance of regulations pertaining to the use of low-sulphur fuel in ECAs. This results from the high price differential between low-sulphur fuel and higher-sulphur alternatives which, at time of writing (May 2013), is $23.00 per tonne. Once the 0.1% sulphur limit comes into force in ECAs in 2015, this incentive to non-compliance will be considerably increased, since (unless vessels have fitted scrubbers) they will have to operate continuously within ECAs on distillate fuel, currently costing $280 per tonne more than high-sulphur fuel.\nLogistical reasons for non-compliance\nAnother reason that companies may fail to comply with regulations is more logistical in as much as vessels with single service tanks may experience problems with fuel changeover. This is likely to be particularly the case when vessels are only intermittently trading in an ECA and where companies and chief engineers are inexperienced in making the requisite changeover. In well-established companies, procedures for fuel changeover are generally established by the company in consultation with chief engineers who are then expected to follow company procedure for changeover and demonstrate such compliance with procedure to port state control officers. Not only does this mean that ECA regulations should be effectively complied with, it also prevents the kind of engine damage that can occur if fuel changes are attempted too quickly. An operator explained:\nWe have company procedures that they must follow […] And that is part of our SMS with DOC as well, because you will get asked that on the audit. The audit they can ask me for, we have just had Isle of Man now [the flag state], and he said show me your changeover procedure and I will then go into the technical manual, show our actual PDF on this of what we would do, and he will say show me your chief doing it, and I will have to go back and look into the records and extract and say this vessel was going into Long Beach you can see what the chief did. [Employer]\nBut not all vessels follow an invariant changeover procedure and in the course of an observed PSCO inspection, a chief engineer remarked that he was following a different changeover procedure from that which had been logged by his predecessor. Changeovers on single-service-tank vessels, which involve flushing through the service tank with low-sulphur fuel oil, may result in inadvertent non-compliance since only very small quantities of high-sulphur fuel need to remain in the service tank for the additional low-sulphur fuel oil (which frequently has a sulphur content of 0.98%, 0.99% or 1.00%) to be thrown ‘off-spec’.\nProblems of off-spec fuel and bunker fuel delivery notes\nThere was some confidence expressed in the major suppliers of bunkers in as much as operators did not expect such suppliers to be found to be guilty of providing fuel that was different to the specification of the order (off-spec fuel). One such view was expressed as follows:\nIt wouldn’t be because it was off-spec when it was delivered because it is tested and guaranteed to be spec as per that note, as per that refinery, as per those people we are working with every day. [Employer]\nSuch confidence may have accumulated as a consequence of the regular practice in many major shipping firms of sending samples of the bunkers provided for analysis at their own choice of laboratory. If such analysis demonstrated that the fuel was off-spec with regard to sulphur content, operators suggested that they would immediately be in touch with their flag state administration and any other relevant authorities.\nIt is interesting to note however that despite the confidence expressed by some operators in the major suppliers of bunkers, this practice of sampling fuel had developed in the context of experience of less trustworthy suppliers. 3 3.  We note that inadvertent contamination of bunker supplies may occur due to incomplete tank cleaning processes between deliveries of parcels of fuel of different specification in terms of sulphur content. View all notes One operator told of a case when 4.5% sulphur fuel oil was bunkered (unknowingly) by one of their vessels in Denmark. He explained how:\nWe had this once last year, the vessel bunkered off the coast of Denmark and the fuel was 4.5 sulphur, how or why 4.5% MGO was even in Denmark in the first place we don’t know, it could have come from someone as a bad batch, it could have got in somewhere and they thought let’s get it out and we ended up taking it onboard the ship. And the danger I had was she burnt the fuel, the chief made a mistake in his calculations, he didn’t come to me and he was burning the fuel. I went to the vessel in Latvia and it came through and I said ‘chief whatever you do, do not burn that fuel’, he had 80 ton of it, I said ‘do not burn that fuel’, and he said ‘but I only have 25 ton left sir’. I said ‘what do you mean you have only got 25 ton left?’, and he said ‘I have been burning it’. So she had burnt 50 ton of fuel in the Baltic region, and if the Port State had gone onboard and said let me see the sample…! [Employer]\nSuch experiences had led to the alternative view that bunker suppliers could not always be trusted and that some would, as a consequence, be open to propositions from operators seeking to avoid compliance with ECA regulations via the use of fraud in the form of the provision of fraudulent bunker fuel delivery notes. One operator put it this way:\nWe deal with um, yeah we see ‘bad’ bunkering companies on a daily basis. There is no…around the world there is no trick that they haven’t tried, I mean they have a huge bible of how to cheat shipping companies for their fuel. So it’s really about the BDN [bunker fuel delivery note]—you can easily forge the BDN if that’s what you want to do. [Employer]\nThe potential for fraud was increased by what was acknowledged to be the very poor standard of bunker fuel delivery notes. 4 4.  We note that small profit margins may act as an incentive for fraud on the part of bunker suppliers although we did not establish any direct evidence of such fraud nor of the potential drivers for it within this study. View all notes As one operator put it, the standard of bunker fuel delivery notes was:\nVery poor, very, very poor. […] it depends where you are,[…] But even Europe sometimes it is very poor, it is kind of sometimes a barge turns up and he throws the line and he pumps it off and away he goes, no one really cares you know and it is very poor to be honest. I think that the standard should be a lot better really. [Employer]\nThis produced a view amongst some operators that enforcement of the ECA regulations actually had to be ‘beefed up’ and tightened rather than ‘watered down’. As one operator described:\nThere really has to be a much more elaborate system in place to ensure that there is going to be compliance. This is really what we want to opt for going forward. [Employer]\nHowever, this view was not universally held and there were concerns expressed about the establishment of greater surveillance, particularly in the form of the sampling of fuel by port state control officers.\nA different problem was brought to our attention by one ship manager whose contracts with charterers provided that it was the charterers rather than the ship managers who organised the supply of bunkers to vessels. Regardless of where the supply was sourced from, the ship manager sent samples to a single company for testing and reported that whilst they had sometimes been assured by a charterer that the fuel supplied was compliant, their tests had revealed that this was not the case. An interviewee explained:\nEverything is sampled through the [company name] but we source our bunkers from where ever the charterer will see fit to bunker which also causes us problems sometimes where the charterer will say this type of fuel is ok and acceptable we will bunker, I will then look at the sample and say ‘no, no, we can’t burn this for sulphur reasons, or I can’t burn this because it is the wrong fuel for the engine’, obviously we have to protect that as well. [Employer]\nConcerns over the fuel supply had resulted in this company taking very elaborate steps to ensure that the fuel they had delivered was compatible with all of their requirements. Given the length of time that it normally took to get sample results back from the laboratory 5 5.  The operator told us that if they were ‘desperate’ they could get test results back faster and as quickly as within a day but that this had cost implications so that standard practice was not to do this. View all notes , it seemed that their measures involved them in very careful forward planning. The following extended extract describes their procedures for testing and the time lag between the time of bunkering and the time when the fuel is cleared for use and some of the consequences of this strategy for planning and for profits:\nWe bunkered this up in Peterhead. That will go into the ship storage tank then, we will not burn that fuel. I wait then because when the barge, the barge will come on and he will give a sample of the fuel with ticket details and everything, that then is presented to us on the fuel sample. But I won’t go off that sample, I take a secondary sample then, when they are bunkering on the manifold we take it from out manifold, 10 minutes into the delivery so you know you are getting a good grade of fuel. That will then go for sampling, I will wait for the 2 sample data’s to come back to myself and I look at the first sample from the barge or the truck, and then our sample, and I will look then at the sulphur quantity, the densities, the viscosities, firstly because you want to see you haven’t been short measured, but then you are looking at all the contaminants underneath. And when I have looked then and I am satisfied with what quantities I see or contaminants then I will contact the ship as well because the email will be sent over to them with the attachment and we will say to the guys you know this fuel is acceptable to burn and you are ok to do that.[…] It is within 2 weeks normally, it is quite a long process. […]The charterer can’t be greedy and just say you need to bunker the fuel now or we are going to leave it to the last minute you put the fuel on and now you have to burn it, they can’t do that. [Employer]\nThis example is particularly interesting because it highlights the extent to which the monitoring of bunkers is already practiced by companies because of concerns relating to fuel contaminants and quality which would seem to indicate that careful monitoring of sulphur levels to guarantee compliance with sulphur-content requirements need not necessarily place an additional operational burden on vessels.\nConcerns over bunker tests by port state control\nAlthough operators were keen to have a ‘level playing field’ in relation to competition with other shipping lines, and while they believed that such a level playing field was best established with effective enforcement of sulphur regulations, they were nevertheless anxious about the idea of port state control officers sampling directly from their tanks. One employer outlined his concerns that these might not be a ‘fair’ test as follows:\nSo then we took it, it was .95 on the bunker note, it was .95 when it came out of the refinery, it might settle in the tanks, that tank might not be used for a few days that could then come into the service tank and port state control officers, again I have heard them go into the bottom of the tank, you know which if there is anything anywhere from you know previous parcels it might be towards the bottom of a tank, yeah? [Employer]\nThe interviewee is referring here to the phenomenon known as ‘stratification’ whereby blended low-sulphur fuel oil may undergo partial separation in storage, which can result in inadvertent non-compliance, when a sample is taken by port state from the vessel’s service tank. Subsequently, this operator went further in outlining his view that he did not wish to see port state control being exerted except in a highly targeted manner which would be likely to exempt his company’s vessels from scrutiny. This appeared to be part of a general view that regulation should be minimal which of course militates against the establishment of a ‘level playing field’ and is therefore in contradiction with his express wish for the establishment of such. As he put it:\nThe people who openly breach regulations should be caught and should be, you know when they are willingly trying to get around regulations, but things are in place for that and the regime that is already here is very adequate for that. I don’t think there is a need for the European commission or for member states to do more port state control than what they already do, I don’t think there is a need because the regime is, it is an intelligence led regime, like the customs. [Employer]\nWhere operators were more enthusiastic about the use of fuel sampling, they nevertheless acknowledged that what was required was a system providing very rapid results. As one explained:\nThey [currently utilised laboratories] can provide the test results after seven days and this does not work. In order to be able to hold back the vessel you need the test maybe four hours back… [Employer]\nThey were therefore relatively supportive of the test kits that were being utilised by some port state control officers (e.g. in The Netherlands). Although these tests were generally acknowledged to be less reliable than ‘send away’ laboratory tests, they were nevertheless supported by some who held the view that:\nNo, I’ve just been looking it up when I was talking to them. I don’t know what the reliability of those test kits is but I somehow doubt that it can be that bad otherwise they wouldn’t be using it. [Employer]\nFuture concerns\nShip operators were anxious about the forthcoming tightening of the sulphur regulations which were due to come into effect in the ECAs in 2015. The additional costs to shipping fuel with a sulphur content of 0.1% or less was felt likely to threaten the competiveness of the shipping industry. The price differentials were characterised as a ‘step change’ by one operator who estimated that it would result in a substantial increase in fuel costs. He suggested that:\nThe change from 1% to 0.1 is a step change, it is not a straight line, it is a step change. And what it means is you have to burn distillate marine gas oil instead of residual fuel oil. And the price premium for that is 70–80%. [Employer]\nIn relation to this price hike there were fears that the new regulation would precipitate a ‘modal shift’ in the transport of freight. This was because it was felt that the change in fuel would increase operator costs so significantly (a 20% increase was estimated by one operator) that freight hauliers would not be able to meet the extra costs. As the above employee went on to observe, such a modal shift would not only damage the shipping industry, as some companies would inevitably fail, but could carry with it negative consequences for ambient environmental quality.\nWe have some concerns mainly in relation to the 0.1% in 2015 which takes place within the emission control areas. We believe, in the big picture that will cause a modal shift, it’ll change flows of traffic, that can have the effect of putting more freight onto the roads. […] it could well be that freight hauliers choose to travel in their trucks […] to Dover and use the very short sea crossing or the tunnel in preference to using the longer sea transit. So we can see, not only in the UK but across Europe significant change to flows of traffic and that could actually have an adverse environmental effect putting more cargo on the roads as opposed to carrying it by sea—a less efficient mode of transport, overland freight as opposed to at sea. [Employer]\nFavoured regulatory checks\nAs has already been noted, not all operators were in favour of stronger enforcement of the regulations relating to air emissions in ECAs. However, those operators who were keen to make sure that competitors did not get away with avoiding the regulations in order to establish competitive advantage acknowledged that regulatory enforcement was not a simple matter.\nIn spite of the perceived difficulties inherent in an ‘auditing’ solution involving checks on bunker fuel delivery notes and samples of bunkers from service (or ‘day’) tanks, such a solution was seen as more practical than the implementation of technical solutions requiring vessels to carry on board emissions monitoring equipment that could be scrutinised by inspectors. As one interviewee explained, technical solutions seemed difficult:\nI mean if you just see it from applicability point of view, to install such a [monitoring] system on I don’t know, 40,000 vessels it just doesn’t seem feasible. So the testing I believe has to happen while you’re in port. [Employer]\nThis operator favoured an auditing solution involving paper checks and fuel samples. It was acknowledged however that testing in port did not resolve the problem of how to ensure compliance amongst vessels in transit (i.e. going through an ECA but not calling at a port in an ECA):\nOf course you would have to figure something out on how to police transiting vessels. That we don’t really know how one would handle yet but…[Employer]\nPolicy recommendations\nA variety of policy recommendations arise from this study and these are detailed fully in a report from the study which has been published on line (Bloor et al. 2013a Bloor, M., S. Baker, H. Sampson, and K. Dahlgren. 2013a. Effectiveness of International Regulation of Pollution Controls: The Case of the Governance of Ship Emissions. Cardiff: SIRC. ISBN 1-900174-44-8.  [Google Scholar] ). Three main recommendations may be regarded of particular interest here however.\nThe first is specific to inspection practice in the United Kingdom and relates to fuel testing and the piloting of ‘sample kits’ as utilised in Germany, Holland and Sweden. The pilot would provide the opportunity to establish the accuracy of different sampling/testing methods with a view to the introduction of such sampling and testing in the future within the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom (and other EU member states) will be obliged to comply by 18 June 2014 with a revised EU sulphur directive issued on 21 November 2012 which requires member states to undertake frequent fuel sampling and testing (European Union 2012 European Union. 2012. “Directive 2012/33/EU of the European Parliament and Council of 21 November 2012.” Official Journal of the European Union 30: 111–123.  [Google Scholar] ).\nThe second recommendation relates to the publication of information on the Equasis website about vessels non-compliant with the EU regulations on sulphur levels of fuel burnt in EU ports. Currently, this will only occur if the port state control officer noting the deficiency records it as a deficiency in conjunction with the vessel’s safety management system in breach of the IMO-ISM code. Such publication is seen to act as a major deterrent to non-compliance and the recommendation is thus to extend the publicity attendant to regulatory breaches.\nThe third recommendation relates to the development of the bunker fuel delivery note. It is suggested that this document should always be written in English, should record the sulphur content of fuel delivered (already an IMO requirement, but not always complied with), should record the registration number of the supplier and that it should be easy to determine if any fraudulent alterations have been made to the note.\nConclusions\nCurrently it is possible to identify a number of difficulties relating to the enforcement of emissions control regulations as they pertain to the North Sea and Baltic ECA. Such difficulties relate to problems with fuel testing, the reliability of bunker fuel delivery notes and technical problems associated with available laser ‘plume testing’ equipment. Notwithstanding these difficulties, at the current time it would appear that most companies are complying with current regulations and that at least some non-compliance may be inadvertent (produced as a result of the supply of ‘off-spec’ bunkers or associated with poor fuel changeover techniques on vessels with single service tanks). Companies expressed a desire for a level playing field to be established in relation to exhaust emissions from ships and yet some companies nevertheless resisted the idea that inspection should increase. Those companies in favour of greater inspection saw auditing solutions such as the inspection of bunker delivery notes and oil record books alongside fuel sampling as more practical than the installation of on-board emissions-monitoring equipment. In relation to the strengthening of existing enforcement, recommendations arising from the research include suggestions for improvements to the bunker delivery note, developing effective fuel sampling techniques following experimental ‘piloting’ and the ‘naming and shaming’ of companies that do not comply with EU emission regulations on the ‘Equasis’ website.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the UK’s Maritime & Coastguard Agency and Sweden’s Sjofartsverket and Transportstyrelsen for their assistance and support.
