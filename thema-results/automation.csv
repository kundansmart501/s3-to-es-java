To address this requirement, a new multiple-input multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple access (MIMO-NOMA) scheme is designed in this paper, where one user is served with its quality of service requirement strictly met, and the other user is served opportunistically by using the NOMA concept. The novelty of this new scheme is that it confronts the challenge that the existing MIMO-NOMA schemes rely on the assumption that users' channel conditions are different, a strong assumption which may not be valid in practice. The developed precoding and detection strategies can effectively create a significant difference between the users' effective channel gains, and therefore, the potential of NOMA can be realized even if the users' original channel conditions are similar. Analytical and numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed MIMO-NOMA scheme.\nLancaster University Bailrigg Lancaster United Kingdom LA1 4YW\n+44 (0)1524 65201\n""","2.5400085","""http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/mimonoma-design-for-small-packet-transmission-in-the-internet-of-things(60141433-e238-44be-9c6d-b6b921cb41f6).html""","[-2.787729,54.010394]"

Introduction\nSection:\nQuadrotors (or quadcoptors) have become very popular platforms amongst hobbyists and research laboratories and are increasingly being used as observation platforms for a number of roles. The main reasons for this appears to be the mechanical simplicity (compared to traditional rotorcraft) which means very low cost. Despite lacking inherent stability, the simplicity also means the aircraft is relatively easy to control by automatic feedback, at least for nonaggressive manoeuvres in calm conditions. For example, Bouabdallah et al. (2004a) achieved satisfactory results for a PID controller. Using a quarternion description, the attitude can be controlled using just PD control ( Tayebi and McGilvray, 2006 ). More recently, PD control ( Marks et al., 2012 ) has been shown in simulation to achieve good responses even for high-upset angles. Satisfactory trajectory tracking and attitude control can be obtained with LQR control ( Cowling et al., 2006, 2010 ; Rinaldi et al., 2013 ). However, in order for quadrotors and similar unmanned vehicles to undertake many proposed roles, high levels of safety are required, but the lack of inherent stability means that the control system is required to be fault tolerant. In this paper we propose the use of an ℒ1 adaptive controller to provide an increased tolerance to partial failure of the actuators/effectors.\nThe ℒ1 adaptive controller was originally proposed in Cao and Hovakimyan (2006a) , and developed through a series of papers ( Cao and Hovakimyan, 2006b, 2007b, c, 2008a, b, c, 2009 ; Xargay et al., 2010 ). Additional details of the method are given in Hovakimyan and Cao (2010) . The ℒ1 adaptive control architecture guarantees stability robustness in the presence of fast adaptation, achieved via continuous feedback. An important feature of this architecture is the separation between estimation (adaptation) and control (robustness). This is achieved by an appropriate modification of the control objective and consideration of the fact that compensation for uncertainties in any feedback loop can be made only within the bandwidth of the control channel. The new objective is to track (both in transient and steady state) the input and the output of an auxiliary linear closed-loop reference system. This allows the use of high gains inside the adaptation block, thus achieving fast adaptation rates which are beneficial for both performance and robustness. The trade-off between these is resolved through the selection of an appropriate filter structure, thus allowing transient tracking to be improved by increasing the adaptation rate without generating high frequencies in the control signal.\nThe ℒ1 adaptive control approach has been applied to many problems ( Cao and Hovakimyan, 2009 ; Sarhadi et al., 2014 , for example). It has also been proposed for the control of quadrotors. Michini and How (2009) presented a design procedure for ℒ1 adaptive control output feedback control and demonstrated its potential by applying it to an indoor quadrotor helicopter. Flight test results demonstrate that the designer specifications correspond to the expected physical responses. Mallikarjunan et al. (2012) designed and implemented an ℒ1 adaptive controller using a backstepping architecture. Three variations were flight tested, and the best results obtained for the variation that used a quarternion model description. De Monte and Lohmann (2013) (also see De Monte and Lohmann, 2014 ) also combine a backstepping approach with an ℒ1 adaptive control to account for the time-varying nonlinear error dynamics that arise from the backstepping design. Verifiable bounds on the tracking error and input signals are provided. In Capello et al. (2013) , a mixed deterministic-randomized approach for the control law design of an ℒ1 adaptive controller is proposed. The controller is tested in simulation and shows good performance. An ℒ1 adaptive controller is designed by Capello et al. (2012) and implemented on a test platform. Experiments show better response characteristics than a PD controller. Zuo and Ru (2014) proposed improving trajectory tracking for a quadrotor by combining feedforward control with ℒ1 adaptive control. Bounds on the tracking error are given. Akkinapalli et al. (2014) presented a quaternion-based backstepping controller for a hexarotor that uses ℒ1 adaptive augmentation for robust attitude tracking.\nThe question of tolerance to failure of a quadrotor actuator/effector has been addressed previously. Maintaining hover while losing control of one degree-of-freedom (notably yaw) is an approach considered by, for example, Mueller and D’Andrea (2015) (see also Mueller and D’Andrea, 2014 ) and by Lanzon et al. (2014) . Control allocation methods that use actuator redundancy in hexrotor or octorotor arrangements have been proposed by, for example, Adîr et al. (2011) , Marks et al. (2012) , Hamayun et al. (2015) and Alwi and Edwards (2015) . A number of approaches to partial actuator failure have been investigated. For example, a backstepping approach is described in Zhang et al. (2010) , whilst a Lyapunov-based adaptive control strategy is investigated in Zhang and Zhang (2010) . A model reference adaptive control approach is described by Dydek et al. (2013) , and an LPV model reference approach by Rotondo et al. (2015) . An approach that incorporates trajectory replanning is proposed by Chamseddine et al. (2015) . A review of these and some of the other approaches is provided by Zhang et al. (2013) and Zhang and Chamseddine (2012) . ℒ1 adaptive control does not appear to have been explicitly investigated for its fault tolerant properties for quadrotors. Hence that is the theme of this paper. In the next section, the quadrotor model is described. In Section 3, ℒ1 adaptive control is summarized. Section 4 describes the ℒ1 adaptive controller design. In addition, a fixed-gain LQR controller with integral action is described. Simulations were performed for the vehicle when subjected to actuator faults, some of the results are presented in Section 5, and the results for the two controllers compared. Finally some conclusions are drawn.\n2. Quadrotor model\nSection:\nDynamic modelling of small VTOL UAVs has been well covered in many sources. In this research, the Newton-Euler approach is used ( Bouabdallah et al., 2004b ; Mian and Wang, 2008 ; Michini et al., 2011 , for example) with the following assumptions:\nthe structure is rigid and symmetric;\nthe propellers are rigid;\nthe rotor thrust and the drag are proportional to the square of the speed of the rotor;\nthe rotor axes are parallel and lie in the z direction;\nground effect is neglected;\nthe inertia matrix is diagonal;\nthe rotor Coriolis force and wind forces are not included; and\nthe motor dynamics are ignored.\nThe basic vehicle configuration, Earth frame, E, and body frame, B, are shown in Figure 1 . The body frame has the axes originating at the centre of mass of the vehicle. An inertial coordinate frame is fixed to the Earth and has axes in the conventional North-East-Down arrangement. It is assumed that the Earth is flat and stationary. Each rotor provides a thrust force, fi, and torque, τi. These combine to a vector of moments about the body axis, M=[L, M, N]T and a thrust force in the negative z direction, −T.\nThe orthogonal rotation matrix Sb to transform from body frame to Earth frame is ( Cook, 2013 ):\nwhere c denotes cos, s denotes sin, etc., and (, , ψ) is the standard Euler angle roll-pitch-yaw triplet.\nThe gravitational force vector, Fg, in the body axis is:\nwhere g is gravitational field constant which is taken as g=9.81 N kg−1.\nThe Newton-Euler equations of motion of the body axes frame are:\n(Equation 26)\nwhere V=[U, V, W]T is the vector of velocities in the body frame, ω=[P, Q, R]T is the vector of angular rates in the body frame, I=diag(Ix, Iy, Iz) is the moments of inertia matrix, m is the mass of the vehicle, F=Fg+[0, 0, −T]T is the vector of the forces acting on the centre of mass, and M=[L, M, N]T is the vector of moments acting about the centre of mass.\nExpanding and rearranging (3) gives:\n(Equation 36)\n2.1. Draganfly X-pro\nThe vehicle that is modelled for use in this work is the Draganfly X-pro quadrotor (developed by Draganfly Innovations Inc) shown in Plate 1 . The quadrotor arm length is 0.50 m. Each rotor has two blades. The radius of the rotor is 0.258 m, and the mean chord of the blade is 0.032 m. A 14.8 V lithium-ion polymer battery is used for supplying the electric power, this being the maximum voltage that can be supplied to a motor. A full model of the vehicle has been obtained by wind-tunnel and other experiments ( Martínez, 2007 ). The mass and inertia terms are:\n(Equation 38)\n2.2. Actuator model\nThe control is effected by four actuators, each of which makes a contribution to the force and moment by means of a thrust vector, τi, i=1, …, 4, that acts in the −z direction at the end of each arm as shown in Figure 1 . The rotors are driven by voltages to four electronic motors, the thrust-voltage relationship can be expressed as ( Martínez, 2007 ):\nFinally, Kg=−(C(A−BKm)−1B)−1, which ensures that the output y(t) tracks the reference r(t) at steady state.\n4.3. LQR+I controller\nThe ℒ1 controller design is characterized by an integrating block in the HD(s) element along with the inner-loop LQR controller. To test the adaptive properties of the ℒ1 controller, an LQR+I controller is designed for comparative purposes as a nonadaptive controller but with similar structure to the ℒ1 controller. The LQR+I controller is an LQR optimal controller based on an augmented plant model of the system that includes integral action on the output error. The structure is shown in Figure 4 .\nTo augment the plant model with integral action, define the integral of the error as:\nThe controller (Equation 117) is designed using the LQR method described in Section 4.1. The weighting matrices are chosen to be Q=diag([100I12, 1,000I4]) and R=I4.\n5. Simulations\nSection:\nThe model and controller are tested in simulation for the recovery performance to partial failures in the actuators/effectors. The failures are assumed to be a partial loss of input voltage that results in an instantaneous decrease in the thrust of a rotor. It is assumed that a voltage loss also results in a loss of the maximum voltage supplied to a motor. The maximum voltage is 14.8 V. From (49), to maintain hover a faulty voltage supply must be able to supply vh=7.28 V. Mapping this value to the failure model given by (20) gives a range, δi∈(0.2420, 1.0].\nFigure 5 shows the failure free transient response for both the LQR+I and ℒ1 controllers to a 1.0 m step demand change simultaneously in both the X and Y positions. The performances are fairly comparable, with a slightly faster response for the LQR+I controller at the expense of some additional altitude undershoot and yaw deviation. The applied voltages are shown in Figure 6 .\n5.1. Failure at hover\nThe first test case considers the upset from hover of an instantaneous failure in i=1 motor voltage supply occurring at t=1 second, that is:\n(Equation 119)\nand δi(t)=1.0 for i=2, 3, 4.\nFor the LQR+I controller, simulation results for (Equation 120) are presented in Figure 7 . The vehicle is at steady state hover until t=1.0 s. When the voltage supply fault occurs, rotor 1 loses some thrust and there is a subsequent loss of altitude. It also generates a pitch moment with a resulting displacement in the X position. The dynamic coupling also causes a smaller roll moment and a displacement in the Y position. The change in rotation rate of rotor 1 also causes a yaw moment and resulting yaw rotation. Values of (Equation 121) result in an unstable response, the reason is that the reduced maximum supply voltage results in a saturated motor demand. For (Equation 122) , the reduced maximum supply voltage is 8.76 V, which, from Figure 8 , is reached for a short time between four and five seconds.\nFor the ℒ1 adaptive controller, simulation results for (Equation 124) are presented in Figure 9 . Values of (Equation 125) result in an unstable response for the same reason that the reduced maximum supply voltage results in a saturated motor demand. This can be seen in Figure 10 for (Equation 126) . From the plots, it is clear that the ℒ1 adaptive controller has a better performance, with reduced deviations from hover and faster response. In addition it has a greater range of (Equation 128) for which the system remains stable.\n5.2. Failure during transient\nThe second test case considers an intermittent failure during a manoeuvre responding to a 1.0 m step change demand simultaneously in both the X and Y positions. The failure model in i=2 motor voltage is:\n(Equation 129)\nand δi(t)=1.0 for i=1, 3, 4.\nThe responses shown in Figure 11 clearly show that the ℒ1 controller is better able to cope with the intermittent failure, with a less oscillatory response and smaller deviations. Figure 12 shows that this better performance is achieved by the adaptation to the failure in the voltage supply to rotor 2 by demanding a greater voltage to that rotor.\n6. Conclusions\nSection:\nThis paper investigates the performance of an ℒ1 adaptive controller for the fault tolerant control of a quadrotor. The proposed scheme uses an LQR controller to stabilize the vehicle in an inner loop, the ℒ1 adaptive controller is applied in the outer loop to estimate and compensate for the actuator uncertainty resulting from failures. Whilst some conditions for the stability of nonlinear systems subject to uncertainty have been established for ℒ1 adaptive controllers ( Hovakimyan and Cao, 2010 ), in practice these are rather hard to determine except for trivial systems. A trial and error approach was hence used to design the controller. The simulations show the adaptive properties of the controller to partial failures in the voltage supply to the motors, and show the better performance of the ℒ1 adaptive controller compared to an LQG controller with a similar structure and closed-loop performance under nonfailure conditions.\nAlthough quadrotors cannot tolerate total failure of a rotor without loss of control of one of the degrees of freedom, applying the ℒ1 adaptive controller to a hexrotor or octorotor would increase the reliability of such vehicles without recourse to methods that require fault detection schemes and control reallocation ( Marks et al., 2012 ; Hamayun et al., 2015 , for example).\nThe control scheme is tested in simulation of a simple model that ignores aerodynamic and gyroscopic effects. Hence for further work, testing with a fuller model ( Martínez, 2007 ) is recommended followed by implementation on an actual platform and flight test. The effect of sensor noise should also be considered along with investigation into the influence of wind disturbances and tolerance to sensor failures. Furthermore, performance at other flight conditions such as steady forward flight should be investigated. The consequence of the loss of a complete effector and the subsequent loss of control of a degree-of-freedom also needs exploring. The question of whether this scheme can be extended to maintain control over fewer degreees-of-freedom in a similar manner to Mueller and D’Andrea (2015) is an open one.\nFigure 1 Quadrotor schematic\nCook, M.V.

This rise in interest is due to the enormous requirements of multi-domain earthquake rescue, pollution monitoring, natural species discovery and other applications in which multi-modal locomotion can offer unprecedented advantages to robot mobility. Swimming, crawling, rolling, walking, running, jumping and flying are quite common in the animal kingdom, and such locomotion occurs in very different physical environments. Interestingly, an animal may perform two or more modes of locomotion. For instance, turtles and salamanders can swim underwater and walk on land, while swans can swim and fly effectively. Their often remarkable abilities could inspire innovative designs to improve the way man-made systems operate in and interact with challenging outdoor environments consisting of multiple media.\nModes of locomotion in nature can be decomposed broadly into three categories: terrestrial, aerial and aquatic. There are situations in which the distinction between categories is vague, such as movement on the surface of water or in underground tunneling. However, generally, the types of locomotion used by animals can be categorized into one of these three areas.\nThe primary venue of locomotion for many animals tends to be mono-modal; the majority of their task-space demands only a singular modality, with minimal need of alternative morphologies for transportation. The fundamental reason for multi-modal animal locomotion is for survival. The need for these multiple modes can arise from different requirements related to survival, including fast escape, fast pursuit, searching for food, breeding, nesting, conserving energy and migration.\nMost phylogenetic lineages of organisms are conservative in terms of habitat use, but some groups display major shifts in this trait. Some of the most spectacular examples of such phylogenetic shifts involve the invasion of aquatic (especially marine) habitats by terrestrial taxa. Because of the very different physical properties of air and water, selective pressures for effective locomotion can generate massive morphological divergences. Shine and Shetty [ 1 ] discussed the aquatic and terrestrial locomotion by studying the data gathered on speeds of sea kraits in water and on land. Multiple invasions of oceanic habitats by terrestrial organisms thus provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the process of adaptation in general and the nature and magnitude of trade-offs involved in adaptive transitions between alternative modes of locomotion. As pointed out by Shine et al [ 2 ], amphibious animals may be subjected to strong but conflicting selective pressures to enhance locomotor performance both on land and in water. Biomechanical models suggest that in snakes, adaptations to swimming (e.g. reduction of ventral plates, flattening of tail) will reduce their ability to move on land.\nIt is impossible to simultaneously optimize performance in two tasks that require mutually incompatible morphologies or physiologies. In addition, conflicting optima can occur for many kinds of traits, but the easiest to study are those in which performance can be easily quantified and optima can be easily identified. Thus, the most clear-cut examples of trade-offs in locomotor performance involve species that move in highly contrasting ways such as running versus flying or swimming. The results showed that locomotor speeds of amphibious sea snakes vary among specie, differ between the sexes within species and change with body sizes. A snake's species and sex also affect its relative speed in terrestrial versus aquatic locomotion. In the paper by Shine et al each of these effects was examined with the aim of evaluating conclusions and predictions from an earlier study [ 1 ].\nAs highlighted by Marlene [ 3 ], animals' kinematic changes between air and water can be understood in terms of the mechanical loads characteristic of these different fluid environments. The increased buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces in water compared to those on land can cause a shift in the predominant destabilizing forces an animal experiences. An animal using pedestrian locomotion under water must contend with hydrodynamic forces that can prevent it from locomoting quickly or that can cause it to overturn or wash away. In addition to an animal's morphology, factors such as posture, behavior and water flow environment dramatically influence the hydrodynamic forces the animal experiences.\nIn another study of an animal's multi-modal locomotion, Marlene measured hydrodynamic forces on the amphibious shore crab Grapsus tenuicrustatus in aquatic and terrestrial postures. The amphibious shore crab changes body posture as well as kinematics, using a different locomotory gait on land than in water [ 4 ]. The crabs walk on land at slow speeds, but in water at these same speeds, the crabs use a more variable gait (submerged punting), characterized by alternating thrust generation and gliding. Due to the lower hydrodynamic forces in the aquatic posture, a crab could move up to 50% more quickly than it could in the terrestrial posture or through a faster water flow environment [ 5 ]. Marlene also found that in slower flow environments, animals can move faster and take advantage of different gaits that are not available to them in faster flow environments.\nA brief survey on the recent application works of hybrid and multi-modal locomotion is presented in the following sections.\n2. Hybrid air-water mobility\nCurrent Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are greatly limited by being able to operate in air only, preventing them from moving effectively on the ground or in water. Developing robots with hybrid air-water mobility would address the need for remote water sampling in inaccessible areas during disasters. Of particularly high importance is the detection of chemicals and biological contaminations in the sea, in coastal regions or in urban areas where humans are in contact with water. This is of paramount interest in disaster scenarios such as flooding situations, after chemical or nuclear accidents and during oil spills. Recent examples, such as the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil spill in 2010 or the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011, show the urgent need for remote sensing capability in hazardous situations to better react to emergencies and coordinate manned interventions.\nWhile some UAVs can land on water, no technology is available that would allow them to both dive and fly due to dramatic design trade-offs that have to be solved for movement in both air and water and due to the absence of high-power propulsion systems that would allow a transition from underwater to air. However, in nature a variety of animals are able to move in both air and water such as diving birds, flying squid and jumping fish. In the following sections, existing concepts of air-water mobility in robotics will be reviewed, and a summary of the design principles for the next generation of flying robots with hybrid mobility capabilities will be provided.\n3. Air-Water mobility in robotics\nOne of the main challenges in the design of aerial-aquatic vehicles includes the design of the mission profile. A variety of approaches can be taken to achieve aerial water sampling (figure 1 ). For example, a water sampling probe can be descended from a hovering UAV (figure 1 (A)) or a simple floating UAV (figures 1 (B) and (C)) might be used to land on the water surface and take a water sample. However, these concepts are inherently limited by either very short flight times or susceptibility to surface movement and by waves that can be detrimental to the operation of the UAV. Other concepts include dropping an underwater vehicle from the UAV (figure 1 (D)) for single-use missions or using the propellers to move underwater (figure 1 (E)), although the propellers that are used for flight are not adapted for underwater operation due to the different fluid properties. Looking at nature, a variety of solutions for air-water mobility has evolved, with several animals executing a plunge dive maneuver, i.e. drop-diving from air to water and transitioning back to flight directly from under the water's surface. This approach of dynamic air-water-air locomotion (figure 1 (F)), although a technically challenging solution, is very promising for high-frequency water sampling in cluttered and unpredictable terrain, with a high robustness to water waves and an avoidance of floating obstacles that would prevent hydroplane style landing and take-off.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 1. Aerial water sampling can be performed with a variety of mission profiles: (A) a probe is descended from a hovering UAV, (B) hovering UAV lands on the water's surface and floats due to buoyancy, (C) hydroplane landing of a fixed wing UAV, (D) UAV drops an underwater vehicle from flight, (E) multi-copter using its propellers to dive underwater and (F) UAV using its flight momentum to dive and transition back to flight.

Novel robotic technologies, fluid structure interaction principles and control methods need to be developed to enable the implementation of AquaMAVs. In efforts toward implementing AquaMAVs, studies have been conducted on the implementation of plunge diving capability in a flying vehicle [ 5 – 7 ], and Liang et al [ 7 ] have developed a testing platform able to fold its wings before diving into the water. However, these systems are currently experimental platforms and are not able to fully transition between air and water.\nPropulsion in both air and water has been studied in [ 8 – 10 ] using a flapping wing approach for diving-bird-inspired flapping flight. Using a hydroplane style surface landing approach, many existing robotic aerial vehicles use the water's surface as an extended runway. While none of these robots are able to operate beneath the surface, some systems deploy underwater vehicles from the air but are usually reliant on single-use, disposable equipment such as parachutes, airbags and disposable wings. However, the existence of demand for air launched underwater vehicles [ 11 ] is important nonetheless, and several military programs have attempted to create manned submersible aircraft [ 12 , 13 ]. A fully integrated AquaMAV would have the ability to be launched from underwater from an autonomous surface vessel as well as from the air, offering added mission capability to existing unmanned vehicle frameworks.\nAlthough several different approaches have been taken in the design of an aerial-aquatic vehicle, a fully functional AquaMAV has yet to be presented. Inspiration from biology, in combination with the best of robotic engineering and a thorough understanding of the fluid dynamics involved in the process, will be a key to achieving this objective and developing this next generation of UAV.\n4. Design principles for effective air-water mobility\nIn the animal kingdom, the combination of aerial with underwater locomotion is very prevalent, with several species able to transition between the two medium very effectively. Examples include flying fish, flying squid, diving birds and diving insects (figure 2 ) [ 15 ]. We have summarised the advantages and limitations of several animals and robots with aerial-aquatic capabilities in table 1 [ 15 ].\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 2. Strategies for aerial-aquatic locomotion [ 15 ]: (A) two stage transition: Flying Fish, (B) Hydroplaning: Ducks, (C) Jet propulsion: Flying Squid, (D) Plunge diving: Northern Gannet, (E) Morphing wings: Common Guillemot, (F) Foot propulsion: Great Diving Beetle.

In this process of biological inspiration it is important to adopt only the principles and not copy the exact morphology of the animals. To this end, we adopt the Inspire-Abstract-Implement paradigm for bioinspired robot design (figure 3 ) [ 14 ] that outlines how the successful robots can be built based on principles from biology.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 3. Inspire-Abstract-Implement bioinspired design paradigm [ 14 ] in which the bioinspired design process can be separated in three distinctive phases which integrate the abstraction of biological design principles with modern engineering tools.

Based on the analysis in table 1 , the most important principles are: (i) using jet propulsion, (ii) employing a wing folding mechanism and (iii) performing a plunge diving approach for the transition from air to water by using the flight momentum to move underwater.\nThe main challenge for the propulsion unit is achieving the very high power density required for take-off. For example, flying fish reach a speed underwater of around 20 body lengths per second. This performance is one order of magnitude higher than what has been achieved with swimming robots so far [ 15 ]. Moreover, miniaturisation of the mechanism would make it very difficult to build a vehicle at a very small size that requires a propulsion choice that can be fabricated across the range of AquaMAV sizes. An alternative and easily scalable propulsion approach is offered by water jet propulsion. Using pre-charged or locally generated pressure, scalable mechanisms can be designed to eject water, allowing for thrust in both water and air. In the animal kingdom, water jet propulsion is used by flying squid that can range from several centimeters to several meters in size, proving the utility and effectiveness of the approach. The first robotic implementations of the high-power water jet propulsion mechanisms are presented in [ 15 , 16 ].\nMost animals have a folding wing mechanism that offers protection for their often fragile wing structures. Folding wings are also used by many birds to actively modulate the wing shape to initiate and guide dynamic flight behaviours. All aerial-aquatic animals use some kind of folding wings. Most notably, flying fish and flying squid use them to sustain lift in air while having them shaped differently in water for efficient swimming. Gannets also fold their wings to reduce the impact forces on their body when diving through the water's surface, allowing them to reach depths easily. For AquaMAVs, using folding wings is likely a preferred choice to protect the wings from mechanical damage on impact, to use the flight momentum to dive deeply without needing underwater buoyancy control and to potentially use the folding wings for efficient dynamics in both air and water.\nAerial-aquatic mobility is the next step for flying robots to enable applications such as water sampling, oil spill response and underwater inspection. The challenges that need to be addressed in the development of these AquaMAVs include propulsion methods and wing folding principles and their integration with novel control approaches for operation in both air and water. Building on principles found in nature by diving birds and flying sea animals, we can develop AquaMAVs and advance the fields of mobile robotics.\n5. Recent works on land-water locomotion\nIn the field of hybrid or multi-modal locomotion, biologists and robotists have collaborated and achieved meaningful results. On one hand, biological emulation and investigation have inspired engineers and have been fused into implementing novel mechanisms and/or improving pre-existing prototype performance [ 40 – 42 ]. On the other hand, robotic prototypes have been developed to understand hybrid locomotion principles [ 10 , 43 – 57 ]. Experimental observation on multi-modal locomotion is often limited to the behaviors voluntarily executed by amphibious animals. Moreover, the measurement of biomechanics and dynamics on free locomotion is also a challenging task.\nTypical cases of multi-modal locomotion include swimming robots with walking and/or flying abilities within amphibious behaviors. Low et al [ 43 ] proposed and developed swimming and crawling gait and action patterns of an amphibious land-water robot inspired by sea turtles, as depicted in figure 4 . Ijspeert et al [ 48 , 56 ] focused on using robotic models to understand behaviors of amphibious salamanders, as shown in figure 5 . The transition from aquatic to terrestrial locomotion was implemented and further understood using a neural central pattern generator (CPG) control scheme in the vertebrate multi-modal robotic prototype. Furthermore, a CPG control architecture was developed for controlling the hybrid locomotion of an amphibious snake/lamprey robot capable of swimming and serpentine locomotion. Yu et al [ 46 ] proposed and implemented a versatile amphibious robot, AmphiRobot-II, inspired by various amphibian principles in the animal kingdom. A novel hybrid propulsive mechanism coupled with wheel-propeller-fin movements was proposed that integrates fish- or dolphin-like swimming and wheel-based crawling. The robot is not only able to implement flexible wheel-based movements on land but is also able to perform steady and efficient fish- or dolphin-like swimming under water. Furthermore, it can switch between these two patterns via a specialized swivel device.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 4. Land-Water amphibian robot inspired by turtles [ 43 ]: (A) swimming and crawling turtles, (B) Crawling gait of a sea turtle, (C) Crawling gait of a turtle-inspired robot and (D) Swimming gait of a turtle-inspired robot.

Some of these robots achieve these tasks through multiple locomotion modes as shown by animals [ 49 , 56 , 58 , 59 ]. Multi-modal locomotion, particularly that of the multi-legged robotics, has recently gained increasing interest due to its ability to achieve natural interaction between the mechanical dynamics of the robot and the environment. Locomotion dynamics are the result of interactions between a particular internal control structure, the mechanical dynamics of the robot's body and the environment [ 60 , 61 ]. In addition to low-power systems and portability, which are vital challenges that substantially limit any successful biorobotic-based application, the proposed paradigms should also take into account issues related to scalability and security.\n6. Works related to air-ground locomotion\nIn nature, many animals that can fly can also move on ground effectively by either walking, crawling or jumping. Walking birds or insects are examples of this faculty, offering precise ground locomotion to the animal in addition to its flying capacity. There are some animals that use their ground mobility as a way to transition from ground to air, e.g. by jumping, which is then followed by gliding flight. Examples of such jump-gliding animals include gliding lizards, locusts, gliding geckos, gliding ants, spiders, gliding frogs, jumping bats, gliding mammals, gliding snakes and many birds (figure 6 ) [ 62 ]. Jumping and gliding can also be found amongst extinct species, such as the Sharovipteryx, and amongst some lizard-like reptiles with similar wings to that of the Draco lizard. Although all of these animals have very different body morphologies, they have converged in their evolution by adopting a hybrid jumping and gliding locomotion strategy. As the focus of this article is of a technological nature, the reader may refer to [ 63 – 65 ] for in-depth reviews of jump-gliding animals, with detailed descriptions of morphology and behavior.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 6. A selection of animals that use gliding as part of their locomotion strategy [ 62 ].

A related class of mobile robots includes propeller or flapping-wing-propelled vehicles that have added ground mobility [ 66 , 68 ] using legs or whegs (figures 7 (E) and (F)). These hybrid robots offer proof-of-concept implementation of multi-modal mobility for aerial vehicles, and they demonstrate the potential of combining ground and aerial locomotion. However, the field on multi-modal mobility is still at its early stages, and there are many unexplored avenues on how to combine aerial with ground and aquatic locomotion. Challenges include actuation, materials, propulsion, control and system integration. Thus, this field offers a wide range of possible research topics. Biological inspiration and creative design beyond the commonly employed airframes and control schemes will be a key in the development of these next-generation multi-modal robots.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 7. Air-Ground robots: (A) UC Berkeley Wing assisted running reproduced with permission from [ 68 ], (B) Stanford jumpglider reproduced with permission from [ 69 ], (C) EPFL jumpglider reproduced with permission from [ 70 ], (D) CMU MultiMo-Bat [ 70 ], (E) U.

Recent advances in biorobotics have helped bridge the gap between robotists and biologists; thus, recent mechatronic systems and robots are controlled in a way that reflects better understanding of complex living organisms.\nThe IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Technical Advisory Committee on BioRobotics organized a workshop on 'Biologically inspired based strategies for hybrid and multi-modal locomotion', in conjunction with the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) that was held at Tokyo Big Sight, Japan on November 3–7, 2013. The aim of the workshop was to explore and tackle the challenges of applying biologically-based concepts to robots in order to improve the robotic capabilities. The specific focus was on hybrid and multi-modal locomotion in air, water and/or on land.\nThe IROS 2013 Workshop consisted of four sessions: multi-modal ground robots, multi-modal locomotion dynamics, swimming and amphibian robots and multi-modal aerial robots. Four keynote speakers and several others were invited to present their work on the relevant fields. All scientists who presented their work at the workshop were invited to submit their work for review and possible publication in Bioinspiration & Biomimetics.\nIn this special issue, seven distinguished research teams with biology and engineering backgrounds present their ideas and works to fuse biological inspirations into robotic hybrid locomotion. Among the seven papers, one paper is concerned with the flapping wings inspired by bat and bird morphology, another paper focuses on a bioinspired underwater robot, four papers consider bioinspired land robots in different locomotion modalities and modes and one paper is devoted to the formulation schemes of bioinspired locomotion by virtue of multibody systems dynamics.\nIn the first paper, Stowers and Lentink present a new mechanism for passive wing morphing of flapping wings inspired by bats and birds. The mechanism consists of an unactuated hand wing connected to the arm wing with a wrist joint. To better understand the passive dynamics, a computer model of the unfolding process was constructed using rigid body dynamics, contact models and aerodynamic correlations. This model predicts the measured passive unfolding within about one flap and shows that unfolding is driven by centrifugal acceleration induced by flapping. These simulations indicate that unfolding is dominated by centrifugal accelerations induced by wing flapping rather than aerodynamic or gravitational forces. Finally, it is experimentally shown that passive unfolding wings can withstand impact with a branch by first folding and then unfolding passively. This mechanism enables flapping robots to squeeze through clutter without complex control. Experiments suggest that friction in the hinge should be minimized to the largest extent possible. The predicted unfold time based solely on centrifugal acceleration is on the order of one wingbeat and can be as short as half a wingbeat. This insight, corroborated from the theoretical, numerical and physical analysis of a flapping folding wing, provides new research avenues for the functional interpretation of the muscle groups that control vertebrate hand and arm wings.\nBioinspired sensing modalities enhance the ability of autonomous vehicles to characterize and respond to their environment. The paper by DeVries et al describes the design and implementation of a multi-modal artificial lateral line for flow sensing and feedback control of an underwater vehicle. By employing an artificial lateral line, the performance of underwater sensing and navigation strategies is improved in dark, cluttered or murky environments where traditional sensing modalities may be hindered. The estimation and control strategies enable an airfoil-shaped unmanned underwater vehicle to assimilate measurements from a bioinspired, multi-modal artificial lateral line and to estimate flow properties for feedback control. The robotic prototype outfitted with a multi-modal artificial lateral line composed of an ionic polymer metal composite and of embedded pressure sensors experimentally demonstrates the distributed flow sensing and closed-loop control strategies.\nInspired by observations from a biological runner, the paper by Park and Kim presents a bioinspired quadruped controller that allows variable-speed galloping. The developed controller estimates the required vertical impulse at each stride by applying the linear momentum conservation principle in the vertical direction and prescribes the ground reaction forces at each stride. Based on a biological observation, a new control design scheme is proposed for high-speed galloping in the MIT Cheetah 2 robot. Quadrupedal animals increase the vertical impulse that is generated by ground reaction forces at each stride as running speed increases and as the duration of each stance phase is reduced, whereas the swing phase stays relatively constant. Based on a biological observation, a new control design scheme is proposed for high-speed galloping in the MIT Cheetah 2 robot. A stable 3D galloping controller is currently applied to the MIT Cheetah 2 robot and will be implemented in indoor running of the robot.\nOne of the most significant challenges in bioinspired robotics is determining how to make use of multi-modal locomotion to help robots perform a variety of tasks adaptively in different environments. In order to address the challenge properly, it is important to understand that locomotion dynamics are the result of interactions between a particular internal control structure, the mechanical dynamics and the environment. The fourth paper by Nurzaman, Kim and Lida presents an approach to enable a robot to take advantage of its multiple locomotion modes by coupling the mechanical dynamics of the robot with an internal control structure known as an attractor selection model. The robot considered is a curved-beam hopping robot that possesses rich and complex mechanical dynamics that are dependent on its interactions with the environment. Through dynamical coupling, the robot performs goal-directed locomotion by gracefully shifting between different locomotion modes regulated by sensory input, the robot's mechanical dynamics and an internally generated perturbation. The coupling between the mechanical dynamics and the attractor selection mechanism enables the robot to take advantage of the different locomotion modes to bring itself toward the goal. The approach was also implemented in a real robot, enabling it to perform goal-directed locomotion based on the same principle.\nAnimals have demonstrated the ability to move through, across and over some of the most daunting environments on earth. This versatility and adaptability stems from their capacity to alter their locomotion dynamics and employ disparate locomotion modalities to suit various terrains. Dynamic climbing is commonly employed by legged animals, allowing for rapid and robust locomotion on vertical and near-vertical substrates. The paper by Miller et al presents a biologically-inspired model for dynamic climbing that captures the underlying pendular motion observed in studies of cockroaches and geckos running on vertical surfaces. This model was inspired from observations of similar gait characteristics in the dynamics of rapidly climbing cockroaches and geckos. This paper investigated several of these factors and proposed policies and methodologies to improve performance and reliability on both dedicated climbers and multi-modal systems.\nRecent works suggest that jumping locomotion in combination with a gliding phase can be used as an effective mobility principle in robotics. The paper by Vidyasagar et al evaluated the performance of jump-gliding locomotion and provides models for the relevant dynamics of flight. It also defines a jump-gliding envelope that encompasses the range that can be achieved with jump-gliding mobility and that can then be used to evaluate the performance and improvement potential of jump-gliding robots. In order to validate the prediction of these models, a jump-gliding robot, named the 'EPFL jump-glider', has been tested in experiments to perform jumps from elevated positions, to perform steered gliding flight, to land safely from considerable heights and to move on ground by repetitive jumping.\nThe last article of the special issue by Boyer and Porez developed a set of generic tools for multibody systems dynamics devoted to the study of bioinspired locomotion in robotics. In considering a general problem of locomotion, they progressively drew a unified geometric picture of locomotion dynamics, starting from the model of discrete mobile multibody systems, followed by the case of continuous and finally soft systems. Starting from animals before moving on to robots, it is shown that there is a need to develop methodological tools for designing, modeling, control and motion planning of a new generation of robots with multi-degrees of freedom. The paper also addresses the practical problem of the efficient computation of these models by proposing a Newton-Euler-based approach to efficient locomotion dynamics, with a few illustrations of creeping, swimming and flying. The authors discovered that behind their apparent diversity, many locomotion modes share common geometric structures.\n8. Concluding remarks\nAs discussed in this article and covered by the papers in this special issue, various modes of locomotion that can be adopted by different genus groups in multiple media are investigated to understand the compromise in ability adopted by the animals when achieving multi-modal locomotion.\nConsidering all of the natural examples shown for aerial, aquatic and/or terrestrial operations, it would appear that using distinct locomotive mechanisms for multi-modal operations of this type is advantageous. This is true for both birds and insects, with birds having the advantage of higher feasible scalability of functions. More experimental works would be required to determine if the terrestrial ability has led to a decrease in aerial ability within a specific species.\nMany different types of locomotion are used across the biological classes, but it should be noted that each has a varying level of competence within the substrate, and as such, careful consideration must be given before assuming that mimicking the animal's techniques will provide the most suitable combination for real-world engineering problems [ 40 , 48 , 60 , 72 – 74 ].\nIn the near future, much closer biologist-and-robotist collaboration will still be an important step for developing multi-modal locomotion. More innovative biorobots are to be developed to emulate and investigate hybrid locomotion since man-made prototypes outperform repetitive behaviors and influential factor isolation when compared to animals. Biomechanics on transition among jumping, walking, running, rolling, crawling, swimming and/or flying should be focused on. Agile movements of animals should be further understood in principles of their central and peripheral nervous systems as well as their musculoskeletal system. Certainly, their adaptation to varying environments is also a really interesting and inspiring component. Furthermore, inspiration from emulating or understanding multi-modal locomotion should promote robotics performance and enable more practical applications. Smart materials, flexible mechanisms and advanced control strategies are essential to realize the enormous potentials in industrial, educational, common-health, security-related, home-service and special fields of robotics.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank the authors for their exciting contributions to this special issue.

Different components in a vehicle have to constantly exchange available information with other vehicles on the road and cooperate for the purpose of ensuring safety and comfort using a Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET). Critical information like navigation, cooperative collision avoidance, lane-changing, speed limit, accident, obstacle or road condition warnings, etc. play a significant role for safety-related applications in VANET. Such kind of critical information gathering and dissemination is challenging, because of their delay-sensitive nature. This paper proposes an agent based model that consists of heavy-weight static cognitive (based on Belief Desire Intention : BDI) and light-weight mobile agents. Proposed model executes push (gather/store and disseminate) and pull (gather/store) operations on information gathered based on information relevance, criticalness and importance. The simulation results show that BDI based information gathering and dissemination scheme performs better than the reliable broadcast scheme in terms of bandwidth utilization, packet delivery ratio, push latency (information saturation time) and push/pull decision latency.\nKeywords\nVehicular ad hoc networks Cognitive agents BDI architecture \nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access\nPreview\nUnable to display preview.  Download preview PDF.\nReferences\n1.\nCaliskan, M., Mauve, M., Rech, B., & Luebke, A.

This paper formulates the ASS problem in the form of a permutation problem and proposes a new solution framework that makes the first attempt at using an ant colony system (ACS) algorithm based on the receding horizon control (RHC) to solve it. The resultant RHC-improved ACS algorithm for the ASS problem (termed the RHC-ACS-ASS algorithm) is robust, effective, and efficient, not only due to that the ACS algorithm has a strong global search ability and has been proven to be suitable for these kinds of NP-hard problems but also due to that the RHC technique can divide the problem with receding time windows to reduce the computational burden and enhance the solution's quality. The RHC-ACS-ASS algorithm is extensively tested on the cases from the literatures and the cases randomly generated. Comprehensive investigations are also made for the evaluation of the influences of ACS and RHC parameters on the performance of the algorithm. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is further enhanced by using a two-opt exchange heuristic local search. Experimental results verify that the proposed RHC-ACS-ASS algorithm generally outperforms ordinary ACS without using the RHC technique and genetic algorithms (GAs) in solving the ASS problems and offers high robustness, effectiveness, and efficiency\nItem Type:\n""","1.0","""http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/34820/""","[-4.28836,55.871751]"

The resultant ice loss from Pine Island Glacier (PIG) and its neighboring ice streams presently contributes an estimated ∼10% to global sea level rise, motivating efforts to constrain better the rate of future ice retreat. One route toward gaining a better understanding of the processes required to underpin physically based projections is provided by examining assemblages of landforms and sediment exposed over recent decades by the ongoing ungrounding of PIG. Here we present high-resolution bathymetry and sub-bottom-profiler data acquired by autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveys beneath PIGIS in 2009 and 2014, respectively. We identify landforms and sediments associated with grounded ice flow, proglacial and subglacial sediment transport, overprinting of lightly grounded ice-shelf keels, and stepwise grounding line retreat. The location of a submarine ridge (Jenkins Ridge) coincides with a transition from exposed crystalline bedrock to abundant sediment cover potentially linked to a thick sedimentary basin extending upstream of the modern grounding line. The capability of acquiring high-resolution data from AUV platforms enables observations of landforms and understanding of processes on a scale that is not possible in standard offshore geophysical surveys.\n""","0.22109509","""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JF004311/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+usage+report+download+page+will+be+unavailable+on+Friday+24th+November+2017+at+21%3A00+EST+%2F+02.00+GMT+%2F+10%3A00+SGT+%28Saturday+25th+Nov+for+SGT+""","[-2.099122,57.165019]"

Furthermore, safety metrics are paramount in the measurement of the impact of new operational procedures or technical improvements in the air traffic control system. The study presented in this paper introduces three safety metrics (reaction time performance indicator, time to closest point of approach performance indicator, and time to closest point of approach critical limit ratio) derived from a given airspace and a sizable, assorted traffic sample extracted from traffic surveillance track data. The metrics are used to characterize the airspace as a function of the safety outcome, which can be continuously overseen. The final goal of the safety metrics is to be used as an airspace safety warning system, where precursory metrics would signal the need to act to maintain the air traffic control system safety target in the face of operational, organizational, technical, or legal changes.\n""","1.0","""https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29AS.1943-5525.0000796""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

The use of stereoscopic imaging is not new; however, what is novel in this approach is the method used to produce panoramic images of the workspace surrounding the rotating line-scan camera. This system is particularly suited to applications which require the `all-round' observation of a scene. These include autonomous vehicle guidance and path-planning for complex manipulator manoeuvres. The results indicate that the positions of targets can be determined, at best, to a measurement accuracy of within\nmm in the X axis (horizontal),\nmm in the Y axis (vertical) and\nmm in the Z axis (range) at a camera-to-object range of 1.5 m.\nExport citation and abstract\n""","0.29506266","""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-0233/9/3/005/meta;jsessionid=A6D06FC3B2B01263B48632225002372B.c4.iopscience.cld.iop.org""","[-1.152004,52.956363]"

When dynamic traffic information in the form of broadcast traffic messages is available, rerouting is achieved by a constrained A* search, which takes congestion propagation into account.

With the target information acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles and estimated by filtering techniques, ground vehicle behaviour is first classified into representative driving modes, and then a string pattern matching theory is applied to detect suspicious behaviours in the driving mode history. Furthermore, a fuzzy decision-making process is developed to systematically exploit all available information obtained from a complex environment and confirm the characteristic of behaviour, while considering spatiotemporal environment factors as well as several aspects of behaviours. To verify the feasibility and benefits of the proposed approach, numerical simulations on moving ground vehicles are performed using realistic car trajectory data from an off-the-shelf traffic simulation software.\nAuthor information\nHyondong Oh\nHyondong Oh received the BSc and MSc degrees in Aerospace Engineering from KAIST, South Korea, in 2004 and 2010, respectively.

"""Brunel_University_London""","""Youth, presence and agency: the case of Kigali’s motari: Journal of Youth Studies: Vol 20, No 10""","""ABSTRACT\nABSTRACT\nThis paper concerns young men who drive motorcycle taxis in Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda. Through an ethnographic account of the livelihoods of these motari, it seeks to account for their continued presence in a city whose authorities are openly hostile to their business, yet in which they remain a significant social force. I argue that it is not either by the exercise of ‘agency’ that motari achieve a social presence in Kigali, but through the social relations in which they are engaged. These relations immobilise them and effectively prevent them from mounting any concerted political challenge to hostile city authorities. However, I suggest that this lack of agency is one reason for their significance, since it makes them available as a resource for the schemes of others. I use this case study to argue for a rethinking of the notion of agency in the anthropology of youth. Rather than celebrating autonomous action or the creative, subversive play of the young, I propose instead a relational understanding in which the capacities and opportunities presented by groups of people in social relations grounds their social significance. It may be the very fact of young people’s domination that makes them socially significant.\n,\nDC\n: University of Georgia Press; published in association with the United States Institute of Peace.  [Google Scholar] ). Strictly ethnographic accounts of Rwandan youth are, however, almost completely lacking: Rwandan studies are broadly populated by genocide survivors and perpetrators (often as ethic proxies) (e.g. Mamdani 2001 Mamdani, Mahmood. 2001. When Victims Become Killers: Colonialism, Nativism and the Genocide in Rwanda/Mahmood Mamdani.\nOxford\n: James Currey.  [Google Scholar] ), peasants, and the elites which staff government, development agencies and businesses (e.g. Gready 2010 Gready, Paul. 2010. “‘You’re Either with Us or Against Us’: Civil Society and Policy Making in Post-genocide Rwanda.” African Affairs 109 (437): 637–657. doi: 10.1093/afraf/adq038 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). While considerable efforts have been made to give Rwandan peasants a profile as political actors (Clark 2014 Clark, Phil. 2014. “Bringing the Peasants Back in, Again: State Power and Local Agency in Rwanda’s Gacaca Courts.” Journal of Eastern African Studies 8 (2): 193–213. doi: 10.1080/17531055.2014.891782 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ; Ingelaere 2010 Ingelaere, Bert. 2010. “Peasants, Power and Ethnicity: A Bottom-up Perspective on Rwanda’s Political Transition.” African Affairs 109 (435): 273–292. doi: 10.1093/afraf/adp090 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 2014 Ingelaere, Bert. 2014. “What’s on a Peasant’s Mind? Experiencing RPF State Reach and Overreach in Post-genocide Rwanda (2000–10).” Journal of Eastern African Studies 8 (2): 214–230. doi: 10.1080/17531055.2014.891783 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ; Newbury and Newbury 2000 Newbury, David, and Catharine Newbury. 2000. “Bringing the Peasants Back in: Agrarian Themes in the Construction and Corrosion of Statist Historiography in Rwanda.” The American Historical Review 105 (3): 832–877. doi: 10.2307/2651812 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ), the same has not been done for youth.\nThe same neglect of youth is evident in public policy in Rwanda. Youth are referred to as urubyuriko, which refers to the state of being young but is commonly extended to young people as a direct translation of the English usage of ‘youth’. This term dominates policy debates on youth. Young men, who are commonly conflated with ‘youth’ as a whole, can be described as abasore or more modishly, abajene from the French jeunes. Responsibility for youth rests with a Ministry for Youth, Culture and Sport and the Ministry of Education. In Rwandan political discourse, youth appear as students at school or university, although only a narrow elite continue through secondary or tertiary education (Sommers 2012 Sommers, Marc. 2012. Stuck : Rwandan Youth and the Struggle for Adulthood.\nAthens\n,\nDC\n: University of Georgia Press; published in association with the United States Institute of Peace.  [Google Scholar] ); youth are idealised as the dynamic entrepreneurs of the new Rwanda; or else youth are feared as potentially anti-social elements. In short, Rwandan political discourse shows all the hallmarks of modern representations of youth internationally: youth is where modernity ‘hides its dreams’ (Foucault 1976 Foucault, M. 1976. Mental Illness and Psychology.\nNew York\n: Harper & Row.  [Google Scholar] ); yet it is also a ‘terror incognita’ threatening the margins of polite society with oedipal images of chaos and disorder (Comaroff and Comaroff 2005 Comaroff, J., and J. Comaroff. 2005. “Reflections on Youth.” In Makers & Breakers: Children & Youth in Postcolonial Africa, edited by A. Honwana and F. de Boeck, 19–30.\nOxford\n: James Currey.  [Google Scholar] ). There is an almost total lack of effective youth services or governmental engagement with young people, which is the responsibility of the overworked volunteers who staff the National Youth Council offices in local neighbourhoods (Sommers 2012 Sommers, Marc. 2012. Stuck : Rwandan Youth and the Struggle for Adulthood.\nAthens\n,\nDC\n: University of Georgia Press; published in association with the United States Institute of Peace.  [Google Scholar] ). The social condition of Rwanda’s youth was almost completely unknown until Sommers’ study.\nBoth in scholarship on Rwanda, and in local politics, Rwandan youth are either neglected completely or co-opted for other people’s politics. This is exactly the kind of observed predicament which stimulated the anthropology of youth and its desire to recover the young as a subaltern group for anthropological study. The anthropology of youth in its current form arose out of a desire amongst scholars to recover the lost voices of the young (Bucholtz 2002 Bucholtz, Mary. 2002. “Youth and Cultural Practice.” Annual Review of Anthropology 31 (1): 525–552. doi: 10.1146/annurev.anthro.31.040402.085443 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). The narrative runs like this: anthropology has always been dominated by adult perspectives; where youth has been studied, it has usually been as the state of adolescence or as a life stage hedged about by rituals controlled by senior community members. Youth in itself, or more importantly, young people in their own right, have been almost completely neglected. As a result, anthropologists of youth claim, there is a need to attend to the young as people with something to say, worthy of anthropologists’ attention (e.g. Cole and Durham 2007 Cole, Jennifer, and Deborah Lynn Durham, eds. 2007. Generations and Globalization: Youth, Age, and Family in the New World Economy. Tracking Globalization.\nBloomington\n: Indiana University Press.  [Google Scholar] ). I am wholly sympathetic with this general approach.\nMotari fit this general pattern extremely well. Motari are overwhelmingly young – my informants had an average age of around 29, and many had begun working at 16 or even younger. When sharing the results of my research with Kigali City Council, I was directed to the office of the Vice Mayor for Youth, Culture and Sport. In the media and in their everyday lives, motorcyclists are most commonly identified as a social problem, threatening ‘security’, umutekano, and have most intense relations with the police and the disciplinary wings of their own organisations. In these relationships, the state of youth, urubyuriko, is cited as a cause of ‘bad behaviour’ amongst motorcyclists: young people are often regarded by those in authority as impetuous, ill-disciplined and lacking the maturity to make appropriate decisions; they require control and guidance (c.f. Sommers 2012 Sommers, Marc. 2012. Stuck : Rwandan Youth and the Struggle for Adulthood.\nAthens\n,\nDC\n: University of Georgia Press; published in association with the United States Institute of Peace.  [Google Scholar] ). The youthfulness of motorcyclists therefore contributes to their reputation as a group who are hard to manage, noncompliant with regulations and policy, or even resistant. Motari themselves sometimes identify as ‘youth’, urubyuriko, and more often as unmarried men, abasore these are importantly negative marks of failure: specifically, their failure to secure an income that would enable them to build a house and marry – key markers of social maturity in Rwanda. 3 3  It follows, as Sommers ( 2012 Sommers, Marc. 2012. Stuck : Rwandan Youth and the Struggle for Adulthood.\nAthens\n,\nDC\n: University of Georgia Press; published in association with the United States Institute of Peace.  [Google Scholar] ) shows, in many contexts, to be young in Rwanda is to occupy a subordinate position and be subject to restrictions and various forms of exclusion. Motari are young, and their youth is a mark of other deficiencies and threats; the way in which motorcyclists are approached by the authorities in Kigali is importantly influenced by this status.\nWhile an identity as youth has little positive value to the social lives of motari, this does not mean that, as a population of young people, they do not have an enormous impact on life in the city. The question, of course, is how – especially in a city which is, as I shall show, overwhelmingly hostile to the ikimotari. Posed in this way, the question becomes less an issue of how motorcyclists elaborate identities as youth, and much more about the social relational systems (which include, but are not limited to the symbolic relations of identity) give motari a presence in the city – a social facticity perhaps, which prevents them simply from being legislated or wished away by the powerful (the key insight from Durkheim 1938 Durkheim, Emile. 1938. The Rules of Sociological Method. Vol. 8.\nChicago\nIL\n: The University of Chicago press.  [Google Scholar] ).\nIn taking this approach, I locate the issue at hand firmly in the (post?) modern moment in urban Africa (Rakodi 2006 Rakodi, Carole. 2006. “Relationships of Power and Place: The Social Construction of African Cities.” Geoforum; Journal of Physical, Human, and Regional Geosciences 37 (3): 312–317. doi:10.1016/j.geoforum.2005.10.001. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). A major concern in the literature on contemporary African cities has recently been the way in which disorganised, marginal and often destitute populations can conjure forms of socially significant action out of the apparent chaos and uncertainty of their lives (Boeck 2004 Boeck, Filip de. 2004. Kinshasa: Tales of the Invisible City.\nGhent\n: Tervuren. Antwerp: Ludion; Royal Museum for Central Africa; Vlaams Architectuurinstituut VAi.  [Google Scholar] , 2011 Boeck, Filip de. 2011. “Inhabiting Ocular Ground: Kinshasa’s Future in the Light of Congo’s Spectral Urban Politics.” Cultural Anthropology 26 (2): 263–286. doi: 10.1111/j.1548-1360.2011.01099.x [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ; Simone 2004 Simone, A. M. 2004. For the City yet to Come: Changing African Life in Four Cities.\nDurham\n: Duke University Press. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ). A dialectic of order and disorder, visibility and invisibility figures the resourcefulness of populations whose urban lives might otherwise be understood to have ‘failed’. At issue here is the question of how people whose marginal position – relative to the state, development agencies, or elites – can nevertheless be parlayed into a certain social presence as salient figures in the plans and calculations of others, and thus achieve certain kinds of agency. My suggestion here is that one effective way of exploring the presence of such marginal bodies of people is to attend to the political economy of their livelihoods (Staples 2007 Staples, James. 2007. Livelihoods at the Margins Surviving the City.\nWalnut Creek\n,\nCA\n: Left Coast Press. http://public.eblib.com/EBLPublic/PublicView.do?ptiID=677831 .  [Google Scholar] ), the resources they deploy and those they present to others to demonstrate how, although often disorganised, impoverished or excluded, such groups figure in the plans and schemes of others, and thus exert influence.\nThis approach is entirely different to that taken by most anthropologists of youth. The contemporary anthropology of youth starts out with the assumption that young people are agents, while youth is a social construction (see for example Amit and Wulff 1995 Amit, Vered, and Helena Wulff, eds. 1995. Youth Cultures: A Cross-cultural Perspective.\nLondon\n: Routledge.  [Google Scholar] ). These basic commitments give the contemporary anthropology of youth a very definite focus, a product of these pre-theoretical commitments (Moore 2004 Moore, Henrietta L. 2004. “Global Anxieties: Concept-metaphors and Pre-theoretical Commitments in Anthropology.” Anthropological Theory 4 (1): 71–88. doi: 10.1177/1463499604040848 [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ). In many respects, agency and social construction are difficult to keep in one frame since the socially (that is, compulsorily) constructed nature of the person or subject might be seen to undermine her agency, if this is interpreted as a capacity for free action (Butler 2005 Butler, Judith. 2005. Giving an Account of Oneself. 1st ed.\nNew York\n: Fordham University Press. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ; see also Laidlaw 2002 Laidlaw, James. 2002. “For An Anthropology of Ethics and Freedom.” Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 8 (2): 311–332. doi: 10.1111/1467-9655.00110 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). In a previous generation of anthropology, this antimony might have been expressed in the contrast been individual and social structure (Fortes 1963 Fortes, Meyer. 1963. “Ritual and Office in Tribal Societies.” In Essays on the Ritual of Social Relations, by Daryll Forde [and Others, edited by Max Gluckman, 53–88. Manchester, Eng.]: Manchester University Press.  [Google Scholar] ). There is thus a clear tension between the terms, in that prima facie it is not clear whether or to what extent agency can be maintained, as ‘freedom’ in the face of social construction (Stern 2000 Stern, D. 2000. “The Return of the Subject?: Power, Reflexivity and Agency.” Philosophy and Social Criticism 26 (5): 109–122. doi: 10.1177/019145370002600507 [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ; Merlan 2016 Merlan, Francesca. 2016. “Women, Warfare, and the Life of Agency: Papua New Guinea and Beyond.” Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 22 (2): 392–411. doi: 10.1111/1467-9655.12405 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ; Asad 2000 Asad, Talal. 2000. “Agency and Pain: An Exploration.” Culture and Religion 1 (1): 29–60. doi: 10.1080/01438300008567139 [Taylor & Francis Online]   [Google Scholar] ; Mahmood 2001 Mahmood, Saba. 2001. “Feminist Theory, Embodiment, and the Docile Agent: Some Reflections on the Egyptian Islamic Revival.” Cultural Anthropology 16 (2): 202–236. doi: 10.1525/can.2001.16.2.202 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). Only certain theoretical directions will allow agency and social construction to operate in a complimentary way. Most important of these are broadly post-modern or conservative post-structural positions associated with the ‘interpretive turn’ in anthropology (Asad 1998 Asad, Talal, ed. 1998. Anthropology & the Colonial Encounter.\nAmherst\n,\nNY\n: Humanity Books.  [Google Scholar] ; Clifford 1986 Clifford, James. 1986. “On Ethnographic Allegory.” In Writing Culture: The Poetics and Politics of Ethnography, edited by George E. Marcus and James Clifford, 98–121.\nBerkeley\n: University of California Press.  [Google Scholar] ). These perspectives locate agency in the capacity to define identities; social construction becomes evidence of human action (as opposed to impersonal Durkheimian forces – see Said 2003 Said, Edward W. (Edward William). 2003. Orientalism. New edition. (Penguin Classics); Penguin Classics. Harmondsworth: Penguin.  [Google Scholar] ). As such the anthropology of youth focuses on the cultural positions taken up by the young, the symbolic resources they deploy to maintain them, and their effect on the overall symbolic economy of their societies. The twin commitments of the anthropology of youth, to the agency and social construction of young people – can be maintained only so long as the basic focus of the sub discipline is on identity and ‘cultural production’ (Bucholtz 2002 Bucholtz, Mary. 2002. “Youth and Cultural Practice.” Annual Review of Anthropology 31 (1): 525–552. doi: 10.1146/annurev.anthro.31.040402.085443 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). Likewise, agency can only, really, manifest itself in young people’s capacity to modify and rework the symbolic terms on which youth are represented and represent themselves (Honwana and Boeck 2005 Honwana, Alcinda, and Filip de Boeck. 2005. “Children and Youth in Africa: Agency, Identity and Place: Introduction.” In Makers & Breakers: Children & Youth in Postcolonial Africa, 1–18.\nOxford\n: James Currey.  [Google Scholar] ).\nHowever, a starting point in material social relations (as opposed to ‘social construction’) does not place the same limits on how we can think about agency (which I refuse to assume at the outset, see Laidlaw 2002 Laidlaw, James. 2002. “For An Anthropology of Ethics and Freedom.” Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 8 (2): 311–332. doi: 10.1111/1467-9655.00110 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). It gives us the opportunity to rethink agency relationally and to ask, in what relationships and contexts do young people compel others – either deliberately or unwittingly – to take account of them? The ‘agency’ revealed here is less the act of a subject, than the particular historical outcome of an intersubjective system (Toren 1999 Toren, Christina. 1999. Mind, Materiality, and History: Explorations in Fijian Ethnography. Material Cultures.\nLondon\n: Routledge. http://www.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0649/99026827-d.html .  [Google Scholar] ). To paraphrase Butler, there is no need for a unitary, prior ‘doer’ behind deeds ( 1990 Butler, Judith. 1990. Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity. Thinking Gender.\nNew York\n: Routledge.  [Google Scholar] , 1995a Butler, Judith. 1995a. “Contingent Foundations.” In Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange, 35–58.\nNew York\n: Routledge.  [Google Scholar] , 1995b Butler, Judith. 1995b. “For a Careful Reading.” In Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange, 127–144.\nNew York\n: Routledge.  [Google Scholar] ) which are effective exactly because they are committed with (or compelled by) ‘another in mind’ (Strathern 1988 Strathern, Marilyn. 1988. The Gender of the Gift: Problems with Women and Problems with Society in Melanesia. Studies in Melanesian Anthropology; 6.\nBerkeley\n: University of California Press. http://www.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0641/88014267-d.html . [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] , 272). To state the point simply, whereas a focus on identity foregrounds the ‘resistance’ of people against a system, a relational focus encourages an analysis of the co-production of people and the system in which they live, including the modes of agency which will appear in that system (Ingold 1995 Ingold, Tim. 1995. “Work, Time and Industry.” Time & Society 4 (1): 5–28. doi: 10.1177/0961463X95004001001 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ).\nI begin by outlining the socio-economic basis of the ikimotari at the level of individual motorcycle owners, riders and their customers. I go on to show how these artisanal workers are implicated in organisational and regulatory regimes which aim to constrain and control them. From these frameworks, I turn to the relationship between motorcyclists and the city authorities – a relationship which has historically been fraught, occasionally violent, and is premised on the city’s unwillingness to permit the ikimotari to continue in Kigali. While motorcyclists’ capacity to resist the pressures placed on them by elites and organs of state is extremely limited, they have nevertheless survived and prosper. As a partial explanation for the continued presence of the ikimotari in Kigali, I explore the ways in which the profession presents others with opportunities for rent-seeking, enrichment and political influence. These political contests, both visible and hidden, place motorcyclists in the city and define their ability to pursue their livelihood. That is, they demonstrate the agency of this group of young people, defined as their capacity to figure in the plans and schemes of others, to have value and social ‘weight’ – what I speak of here as ‘presence’.\nThe ikimotari in Kigali\nIn common with East Africa’s other major cities, motorcycle taxis are a ubiquitous feature of Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda. Locally called taxi-moto or simply moto, these taxis congregate at major intersections, bus stations and in marked areas throughout the city but can be hailed anywhere. A trip on a moto costs between RWF 300 and RWF 2000 (about £0.30–£2.00). Taking a moto is almost always the fastest way to move around Kigali, and for the majority of people without their own vehicles, is usually the only means of transport available in the early mornings or at night.\nMotorcycle taxis are not the only form of public transport in Kigali. The cheapest and most widely used form of transport is provided by small minibuses called matatu with a capacity of either 18 or 36. These ply set routes, usually from the town centre outwards into the suburbs. Bus fares range from RWF 100 to RWF 300. Taxicabs are also available, although they are expensive and rarely used by most people. Taxi drivers complain that they find customers only on special occasions – weddings, funerals, for trips to the airport or a big night on the town. Recently, large buses familiar from European transport systems have been introduced into Kigali, operated by Kigali Bus Services (KBS) (Oz Architecture and Kigali City Council 2013 Oz Architecture and Kigali City Council. 2013. “Kigali City Transportation Masterplan Report.” http://www.masterplan2013.kigalicity.gov.rw/downloads/Docs/RWF1101_04_Kigali%20Transportation%20Master%20Plan_04062013-s.pdf .  [Google Scholar] ).\nMotorcycles are valued because of their capacities to transport people fast, relatively cheaply, door-to-door and at all hours. Whereas buses work on designated routes, with some neighbourhoods a considerable distance from a bus route, motos are available everywhere. Unlike buses, they also drop people exactly where they want to go and operate after 9 pm, serving bars and clubs in town. These are issues of importance in a context in which to walk long distances, sweating in the heat is felt to be demeaning and in which male social life revolves around drinking in bars. Taxicabs offer a similar service, but their fares are simply too high for most people. Motos are not cheap, but even people on relatively modest incomes can afford to use them when the need arises. They also have the advantage of being able to negotiate standing traffic, a considerable issue in Kigali on arterial routes at peak times. We should not allow ourselves to lose sight of these basic dimensions of the moto sector in the analysis which follows.\nThe value of motorcycles for transport is in spite of their low social prestige. Motari operate in the context of an explicit cultural hierarchy of vehicles, in which operating – or better still owning – a vehicle confers considerable prestige. Bicycles used to transport goods and people occupy the bottom rung of this hierarchy, followed by small mopeds used for personal transport and as taxis. Motorcycles are regarded as a step up from either, but almost all of the motorcyclists I spoke to aspired to drive taxicabs in spite of the lower incomes they offer, minibuses or even trucks. The aspiration to drive a taxi was often explicitly made an issue of ‘respect’ (agaciro) by informants. Privately owned cars – preferably luxurious sedans or four-wheel drive models occupy the top of this hierarchy. 4 4  This is a somewhat simplified account, which deals with the major vehicle types in use in Kigali. It should be noted that riding a bicycle as a sport is an elite activity. Likewise, more powerful or stylish motorcycles, or even mopeds can be status symbols. Motari can salvage some relative prestige by decorating their machines with stickers and paint – commonly displaying pan-African symbolism, rappers or footballers – or even fitting elaborate LED lighting to the wheels or frame to attract ‘superstars’, cool urban youth. View all notes Not incidentally, this ordering of vehicles correlates closely with age: working as a motari is a young man’s profession, since it requires considerable strength. Correspondingly, driving a moto is not a prestigious livelihood – all the less as riders are usually dirty, dusty and dressed in layers of old jackets and sweaters at work – but one appropriate for youths and other people of low social status. Many motorcyclists complain of the ‘disrespect’ (agasuzuru) they receive from customers and officials.\nIn late 2012, there were around 10,500 registered motorcycle taxi drivers in Kigali, 5 5  I am grateful to SYTRAMORWA and FERWACOTAMO for this figure. View all notes a city of some 1.2 million people. This is almost certainly an underestimate of their true numbers, as in some areas and at certain times, large numbers of undocumented riders work, especially away from the city centre and on dirt roads. Their sheer numbers give motari importance in the city’s economy. The average household size in Kigali is 4.7 people (National Institute of Statistics 2012b National Institute of Statistics. 2012b. “Third Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey (EICV3).”  [Google Scholar] ). Interviews with motorcyclists in 2012 suggested that on average they support close to this number of people, around 4.5. That means that between 4% and 5% of the city’s population is supported by the ikimotari, or as motari put it, as a motorcyclist ‘you feed many people’ (utunze abantu benshi). 6 6  This is a claim that is in tension with motorcyclists relative (social) youth. Young people do not support households in Rwanda, where the capacity to support a family is a marker of adulthood (Sommers 2012 Sommers, Marc. 2012. Stuck : Rwandan Youth and the Struggle for Adulthood.\nAthens\n,\nDC\n: University of Georgia Press; published in association with the United States Institute of Peace.  [Google Scholar] ). Some motorcyclists are junior members of larger households to which they contribute, however a large number especially of riders who own their own machines are household heads in their own right. The claim to ‘feed many people’ is therefore in a sense a means of contesting motorcyclists’ subordinate role as ‘young people’. View all notes\nMoreover, the sector is growing rapidly. In the three years to 2011, the number of registered motorcycle taxis in Rwanda increased by more than 250% (Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency 2011 Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency. 2011. “Key Statistics Information: Transport of Persons (Road Transport).”  [Google Scholar] ). This growth has been driven in part by increased registration of motorcyclists, but also, motari claim, by a relaxation of the driving test and a considerable increase in the opportunities for testing. The growth in motos reflects a countrywide expansion in both candidates for driving tests and awarded licenses in recent years. Between 2009 and 2011 147,000 licenses were awarded – more than 70% more than there are vehicles on Rwanda’s roads (Asiimwe 2012 Asiimwe, Bosco. 2012. “Rwandans Rush to Own Driving Permits.” The New Times, February 6, sec. News.  [Google Scholar] ). Learning to drive is clearly a widely held aspiration amongst Rwandans, especially male youth. Driving a motorcycle is seen by many as a route out of poverty – and reasonably so: a motorcyclist can expect to take home between |RWF 1000 and RW 5000 a day, a good income for the poorly educated and unskilled youth who make up the bulk of Kigali’s motari.\nThe Rwandan National Institute of Statistics collects poverty data on a household basis, so it is difficult to see how these figures compare to young people in other situations. However, the national poverty line at the time of my research was RWF 118,000 per adult per year (National Institute of Statistics 2012b National Institute of Statistics. 2012a. “EICV Thematic Report: Youth.”  [Google Scholar] ). Assuming that motari belong on average a household of between four and five people, even if that household had no other workers, a motorcyclist earning just RWF 1700 a day would be able to maintain all of its members above the poverty line. The conclusion that motorcyclists are not poor is corroborated by Sommers’ ( 2012 Sommers, Marc. 2012. Stuck : Rwandan Youth and the Struggle for Adulthood.\nAthens\n,\nDC\n: University of Georgia Press; published in association with the United States Institute of Peace.  [Google Scholar] ) account of urban youth poverty. Although his data was collected in 2008 and prices have since risen, it is striking that the young people he interviewed regarded an income as adequate if it enabled them to secure lodging and buy one hot meal a day. In 2012, a one room house, often shared with at least one other working person, could cost as little as RWF 25,000 per month, while a hot meal could cost as little as RWF 500. Even a relatively unsuccessful rider can easily command these amounts of money. Of course, the livelihood of a motorcyclist is by no means as comfortable as that of the city’s emergent middle class. 7 7  The notion of ‘middle class’ should be used with great caution here. By some definitions, motorcyclists are already ‘middle class’ in terms of their consumption power (Ncube and Lufumpa 2015 Ncube, Mthuli, and Charles Leyeka Lufumpa, eds. 2015. The Emerging Middle Class in Africa.\nNew York\n,\nNY\n: Routledge.  [Google Scholar] ). However, in terms of their lifestyle, they are clearly not meaningfully middle class (Burger et al. 2015 Burger, Ronelle, Cindy Lee Steenekamp, Servaas van der Berg, and Asmus Zoch. 2015. “The Emergent Middle Class in Contemporary South Africa: Examining and Comparing Rival Approaches.” Development Southern Africa 32 (1): 25–40. doi: 10.1080/0376835X.2014.975336 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) and often teeter on the brink of a return to poverty (Visagie 2015 Visagie, Justin. 2015. “Growth of the Middle Class: Two Perspectives That Matter for Policy.” Development Southern Africa 32 (1): 3–24. doi: 10.1080/0376835X.2014.965387 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). They are also subject to patterns of vulnerability and humiliation that are not consistent with a recognisably ‘middle class’ lifestyle (Scott 1990 Scott, James C. 1990. Domination and the Arts of Resistance: Hidden Transcripts.\nNew Haven\n: Yale University Press. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ). View all notes Riders were very well aware of this and extremely realistic about the relative monetary worth of their profession. For example, someone working as a bank teller or as a salesperson in one of the upscale supermarkets in town – a job for educated young people – would expect to earn three or four times as much as a motorcyclist, and of course undergo much less risk in the process.\nThe ikimotari is a strictly artisanal business. Most riders do not own the bikes they ride. Rather they either rent or lease them from small-scale entrepreneurs, ababosi or abakoresha, ‘bosses’ for around RWF 5000 per day. These are not relationships of employment, even though motari sometimes speak as though they were. Rather they are relationships of clientship and patronage, normally between a senior person and a younger man. Bosses can make considerable amounts of money from their relationship with motari. Over twelve months, a motorcycle leased or rented at RWF 5000 per day can return almost RWF 300,000 on an investment of RWF 1,300,000, or about 20% profit. Where bosses rent or lease bikes they have acquired second hand – for as little as 500,000 – the possible profits are much higher.\nThese relationships are highly individual. In some cases a rider’s boss is a neighbour or friend, perhaps someone with an interest in the young man and who introduces him to the business in order to advance his prospects while making a profit. In other cases, riders barely know their bosses and enter into purely monetary transactions with them. In these cases, other riders usually make the introduction or occasionally riders are connected to bosses through their co-operative organisations. A minority of riders are owner-operators, most having acquired their first machines through a lease arrangement with a boss, a few using commercial credit. Another, larger minority have no regular access to motorbikes at all and, lacking a regular boss, rely on borrowing motorcycles from other motari at the same RWF 5000 fee. In any case, riders gain access to motorcycles in individuated and sometimes closely guarded networks of friendship and patronage.\nThere are no established social systems – based on ethnicity, region, kinship or any other factor – which I could discern organising motari into wider networks beyond their particular friendships, immediate family and their bosses. Indeed, motorcyclists’ social circles are likely to be localised rather than based on their occupation. Riders I became friendly with were likely to move amongst other young people, usually in insecure employment or with no fixed source of income: market carriers, builders’ helpers, petty hustlers, car washers and drug dealers figured prominently in the peer groups of riders I knew. These friendship groups seemed more often than not to be based on where a rider lived, rather than anchored in circle of colleagues. 8 8  See Sommers ( 2012 Sommers, Marc. 2012. Stuck : Rwandan Youth and the Struggle for Adulthood.\nAthens\n,\nMD\n: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers.  [Google Scholar] ) and Latour ( 1993 Latour, Bruno. 1993. We Have Never Been Modern.\nCambridge\n,\nMA\n: Harvard University Press.  [Google Scholar] ), both of whom have argued that the relentless focus on the relation between individuals and a system – typically conceptualised as society or culture – places serious constraints on our ability to comprehend social life. For both theorists, the ‘purification’ (Latour 1993 Laidlaw, James. 2002. “For An Anthropology of Ethics and Freedom.” Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 8 (2): 311–332. doi: 10.1111/1467-9655.00110 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) of a social field to reveal individuals as points of autonomous agency is simultaneously to render invisible the relationships that make that agency possible. Hence for Latour, a focus on human agency neglects the agency of non-human systems in constituting it. Similarly for Strathern, attributing an act to a specific author erases the chain of action that made that authorship possible (Strathern 2001 Strathern, Marilyn. 2001. “The Patent and the Malanggan.” Theory, Culture and Society 18 (4): 1–26. doi: 10.1177/02632760122051850 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). In both cases, those elements of a situation that are erased in the effort to identify agency are relegated to a non-agentive or constraining context or system against which people appear to act (Strathern 2003 Strathern, Marilyn. 2003. “Redescribing Society.” Minerva 41: 263–276. doi: 10.1023/A:1025586327342 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). In this vein, Graeber ( 2001 Graeber, David. 2001. Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of Our Own Dreams.\nNew York\n: Palgrave. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ) has argued for a reconceptualization of social science that would remove completely the distinction between individual and society, and thus between agency and structure, in favour of a vision of social life as a system in operation, where agency and events are multiply constructed out of the actions of others. In short, to act is always to stand in relation to someone or something else as the condition of acting.\nNaturally, there is nothing specific to studies of youth about these theoretical positions. They become pressing insofar as anthropologists and other scholars of youth oppose the young to other sections of society, social structures or cultural systems that constrain or control them and against which their agency is manifest. In fact, the entire architecture of ‘youth cultural agency’ outlined in the introduction to this paper stands in stark contrast to the kind of theoretical positions mapped out by Strathern, Latour and Graeber.\nHence, at a methodological level, this reading of agency suggests that it is a mistake to isolate youth from other domains of social life. It is common, for example, to distinguish ‘youth cultures’ from ‘adult society’ and then to enter into an analysis of the way in which youth cultures demonstrate the agency of youth in the appropriation and modification of ‘adult’ norms and values (Blackman 2005 Blackman, Shane. 2005. “Youth Subcultural Theory: A Critical Engagement with the Concept, Its Origins and Politics, from the Chicago School to Postmodernism.” Journal of Youth Studies 8 (1): 1–20. doi: 10.1080/13676260500063629 [Taylor & Francis Online]   [Google Scholar] ). Yet the distinction between youth and adult social spheres can never be more than an artefact of an analytical perspective. It is just as fruitless to try to define ‘women’s social lives’ from the lives of their menfolk: these things, viewed at a wider angle, are necessarily intertwined and mutually constitutive (Strathern 1980 Strathern, Marilyn. 1980. “No Nature, No Culture: The Hagen Case.” In Nature, Culture and Gender, edited by Carol P. MacCormack and Marilyn Strathern, 174–222.\nCambridge\n: Cambridge University Press.  [Google Scholar] , 1988 Strathern, Marilyn. 1988. The Gender of the Gift: Problems with Women and Problems with Society in Melanesia. Studies in Melanesian Anthropology; 6.\nBerkeley\n: University of California Press. http://www.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0641/88014267-d.html . [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ; Abu-Lughod 1990 Abu-Lughod, Lila. 1990. “The Romance of Resistance: Tracing Transformations of Power through Bedouin Women.” American Ethnologist 17 (1): 41–55. doi: 10.1525/ae.1990.17.1.02a00030 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). This is not to say that either young people, or women are unimportant to a given social formation. It is rather to recognise that even the subsidiary elements in a system shape that system in significant ways (Scott 1998 Scott, James C. 1998. Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed. Yale Agrarian Studies.\nNew Haven\n: Yale University Press. http://www.h-net.org/review/hrev-a0a9o0-aa .  [Google Scholar] ). How women relate to men is generally recognised as more significant than the fact that there are women (Moore 1999 Moore, Henrietta L. 1999. “Whatever Happened to Women and Men? Gender and Other Crises in Anthropology.” In Anthropological Theory Today, 151–171.\nCambridge\n: Polity Press.  [Google Scholar] ); likewise, the relation of young people to their seniors should surely by granted more significance than what young people do in their putatively independent cultural worlds.\nThus, just as feminist anthropology has effectively shifted its methodological stance from a focus on women to a focus on gender relations, it may be time for the anthropology of youth to abandon the notion that attending to young people and their actions is an adequate basis for accounting for the various social phenomena we term ‘youth’. Very often it is the lot of the young to be dominated and exploited by people older and better connected than they are. This does not mean that young people do not matter, or that we must strive to isolate this neglected population in opposition to others; it simply calls for the acknowledgement that the agency of youth is manifest more in the ways they are co-opted for the schemes of others, perhaps, as here, related to the patterns of their livelihoods, than in their independent exercise of will. That is, young people are more significant in their presence than in their capacity for independent and unconstrained action.\nAcknowledgements\nI wish to thank colleagues who attended the 2013 Centre for Anthropological Research on Childhood, Youth and Education workshop, especially Phil Mizen and Ginny Morrow, for their helpful comments.

"""Brunel_University_London""","""Youth, presence and agency: the case of Kigali’s motari: Journal of Youth Studies: Vol 20, No 10""","""ABSTRACT\nABSTRACT\nThis paper concerns young men who drive motorcycle taxis in Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda. Through an ethnographic account of the livelihoods of these motari, it seeks to account for their continued presence in a city whose authorities are openly hostile to their business, yet in which they remain a significant social force. I argue that it is not either by the exercise of ‘agency’ that motari achieve a social presence in Kigali, but through the social relations in which they are engaged. These relations immobilise them and effectively prevent them from mounting any concerted political challenge to hostile city authorities. However, I suggest that this lack of agency is one reason for their significance, since it makes them available as a resource for the schemes of others. I use this case study to argue for a rethinking of the notion of agency in the anthropology of youth. Rather than celebrating autonomous action or the creative, subversive play of the young, I propose instead a relational understanding in which the capacities and opportunities presented by groups of people in social relations grounds their social significance. It may be the very fact of young people’s domination that makes them socially significant.\n,\nDC\n: University of Georgia Press; published in association with the United States Institute of Peace.  [Google Scholar] ). Strictly ethnographic accounts of Rwandan youth are, however, almost completely lacking: Rwandan studies are broadly populated by genocide survivors and perpetrators (often as ethic proxies) (e.g. Mamdani 2001 Mamdani, Mahmood. 2001. When Victims Become Killers: Colonialism, Nativism and the Genocide in Rwanda/Mahmood Mamdani.\nOxford\n: James Currey.  [Google Scholar] ), peasants, and the elites which staff government, development agencies and businesses (e.g. Gready 2010 Gready, Paul. 2010. “‘You’re Either with Us or Against Us’: Civil Society and Policy Making in Post-genocide Rwanda.” African Affairs 109 (437): 637–657. doi: 10.1093/afraf/adq038 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). While considerable efforts have been made to give Rwandan peasants a profile as political actors (Clark 2014 Clark, Phil. 2014. “Bringing the Peasants Back in, Again: State Power and Local Agency in Rwanda’s Gacaca Courts.” Journal of Eastern African Studies 8 (2): 193–213. doi: 10.1080/17531055.2014.891782 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ; Ingelaere 2010 Ingelaere, Bert. 2010. “Peasants, Power and Ethnicity: A Bottom-up Perspective on Rwanda’s Political Transition.” African Affairs 109 (435): 273–292. doi: 10.1093/afraf/adp090 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 2014 Ingelaere, Bert. 2014. “What’s on a Peasant’s Mind? Experiencing RPF State Reach and Overreach in Post-genocide Rwanda (2000–10).” Journal of Eastern African Studies 8 (2): 214–230. doi: 10.1080/17531055.2014.891783 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ; Newbury and Newbury 2000 Newbury, David, and Catharine Newbury. 2000. “Bringing the Peasants Back in: Agrarian Themes in the Construction and Corrosion of Statist Historiography in Rwanda.” The American Historical Review 105 (3): 832–877. doi: 10.2307/2651812 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ), the same has not been done for youth.\nThe same neglect of youth is evident in public policy in Rwanda. Youth are referred to as urubyuriko, which refers to the state of being young but is commonly extended to young people as a direct translation of the English usage of ‘youth’. This term dominates policy debates on youth. Young men, who are commonly conflated with ‘youth’ as a whole, can be described as abasore or more modishly, abajene from the French jeunes. Responsibility for youth rests with a Ministry for Youth, Culture and Sport and the Ministry of Education. In Rwandan political discourse, youth appear as students at school or university, although only a narrow elite continue through secondary or tertiary education (Sommers 2012 Sommers, Marc. 2012. Stuck : Rwandan Youth and the Struggle for Adulthood.\nAthens\n,\nDC\n: University of Georgia Press; published in association with the United States Institute of Peace.  [Google Scholar] ); youth are idealised as the dynamic entrepreneurs of the new Rwanda; or else youth are feared as potentially anti-social elements. In short, Rwandan political discourse shows all the hallmarks of modern representations of youth internationally: youth is where modernity ‘hides its dreams’ (Foucault 1976 Foucault, M. 1976. Mental Illness and Psychology.\nNew York\n: Harper & Row.  [Google Scholar] ); yet it is also a ‘terror incognita’ threatening the margins of polite society with oedipal images of chaos and disorder (Comaroff and Comaroff 2005 Comaroff, J., and J. Comaroff. 2005. “Reflections on Youth.” In Makers & Breakers: Children & Youth in Postcolonial Africa, edited by A. Honwana and F. de Boeck, 19–30.\nOxford\n: James Currey.  [Google Scholar] ). There is an almost total lack of effective youth services or governmental engagement with young people, which is the responsibility of the overworked volunteers who staff the National Youth Council offices in local neighbourhoods (Sommers 2012 Sommers, Marc. 2012. Stuck : Rwandan Youth and the Struggle for Adulthood.\nAthens\n,\nDC\n: University of Georgia Press; published in association with the United States Institute of Peace.  [Google Scholar] ). The social condition of Rwanda’s youth was almost completely unknown until Sommers’ study.\nBoth in scholarship on Rwanda, and in local politics, Rwandan youth are either neglected completely or co-opted for other people’s politics. This is exactly the kind of observed predicament which stimulated the anthropology of youth and its desire to recover the young as a subaltern group for anthropological study. The anthropology of youth in its current form arose out of a desire amongst scholars to recover the lost voices of the young (Bucholtz 2002 Bucholtz, Mary. 2002. “Youth and Cultural Practice.” Annual Review of Anthropology 31 (1): 525–552. doi: 10.1146/annurev.anthro.31.040402.085443 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). The narrative runs like this: anthropology has always been dominated by adult perspectives; where youth has been studied, it has usually been as the state of adolescence or as a life stage hedged about by rituals controlled by senior community members. Youth in itself, or more importantly, young people in their own right, have been almost completely neglected. As a result, anthropologists of youth claim, there is a need to attend to the young as people with something to say, worthy of anthropologists’ attention (e.g. Cole and Durham 2007 Cole, Jennifer, and Deborah Lynn Durham, eds. 2007. Generations and Globalization: Youth, Age, and Family in the New World Economy. Tracking Globalization.\nBloomington\n: Indiana University Press.  [Google Scholar] ). I am wholly sympathetic with this general approach.\nMotari fit this general pattern extremely well. Motari are overwhelmingly young – my informants had an average age of around 29, and many had begun working at 16 or even younger. When sharing the results of my research with Kigali City Council, I was directed to the office of the Vice Mayor for Youth, Culture and Sport. In the media and in their everyday lives, motorcyclists are most commonly identified as a social problem, threatening ‘security’, umutekano, and have most intense relations with the police and the disciplinary wings of their own organisations. In these relationships, the state of youth, urubyuriko, is cited as a cause of ‘bad behaviour’ amongst motorcyclists: young people are often regarded by those in authority as impetuous, ill-disciplined and lacking the maturity to make appropriate decisions; they require control and guidance (c.f. Sommers 2012 Sommers, Marc. 2012. Stuck : Rwandan Youth and the Struggle for Adulthood.\nAthens\n,\nDC\n: University of Georgia Press; published in association with the United States Institute of Peace.  [Google Scholar] ). The youthfulness of motorcyclists therefore contributes to their reputation as a group who are hard to manage, noncompliant with regulations and policy, or even resistant. Motari themselves sometimes identify as ‘youth’, urubyuriko, and more often as unmarried men, abasore these are importantly negative marks of failure: specifically, their failure to secure an income that would enable them to build a house and marry – key markers of social maturity in Rwanda. 3 3  It follows, as Sommers ( 2012 Sommers, Marc. 2012. Stuck : Rwandan Youth and the Struggle for Adulthood.\nAthens\n,\nDC\n: University of Georgia Press; published in association with the United States Institute of Peace.  [Google Scholar] ) shows, in many contexts, to be young in Rwanda is to occupy a subordinate position and be subject to restrictions and various forms of exclusion. Motari are young, and their youth is a mark of other deficiencies and threats; the way in which motorcyclists are approached by the authorities in Kigali is importantly influenced by this status.\nWhile an identity as youth has little positive value to the social lives of motari, this does not mean that, as a population of young people, they do not have an enormous impact on life in the city. The question, of course, is how – especially in a city which is, as I shall show, overwhelmingly hostile to the ikimotari. Posed in this way, the question becomes less an issue of how motorcyclists elaborate identities as youth, and much more about the social relational systems (which include, but are not limited to the symbolic relations of identity) give motari a presence in the city – a social facticity perhaps, which prevents them simply from being legislated or wished away by the powerful (the key insight from Durkheim 1938 Durkheim, Emile. 1938. The Rules of Sociological Method. Vol. 8.\nChicago\nIL\n: The University of Chicago press.  [Google Scholar] ).\nIn taking this approach, I locate the issue at hand firmly in the (post?) modern moment in urban Africa (Rakodi 2006 Rakodi, Carole. 2006. “Relationships of Power and Place: The Social Construction of African Cities.” Geoforum; Journal of Physical, Human, and Regional Geosciences 37 (3): 312–317. doi:10.1016/j.geoforum.2005.10.001. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). A major concern in the literature on contemporary African cities has recently been the way in which disorganised, marginal and often destitute populations can conjure forms of socially significant action out of the apparent chaos and uncertainty of their lives (Boeck 2004 Boeck, Filip de. 2004. Kinshasa: Tales of the Invisible City.\nGhent\n: Tervuren. Antwerp: Ludion; Royal Museum for Central Africa; Vlaams Architectuurinstituut VAi.  [Google Scholar] , 2011 Boeck, Filip de. 2011. “Inhabiting Ocular Ground: Kinshasa’s Future in the Light of Congo’s Spectral Urban Politics.” Cultural Anthropology 26 (2): 263–286. doi: 10.1111/j.1548-1360.2011.01099.x [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ; Simone 2004 Simone, A. M. 2004. For the City yet to Come: Changing African Life in Four Cities.\nDurham\n: Duke University Press. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ). A dialectic of order and disorder, visibility and invisibility figures the resourcefulness of populations whose urban lives might otherwise be understood to have ‘failed’. At issue here is the question of how people whose marginal position – relative to the state, development agencies, or elites – can nevertheless be parlayed into a certain social presence as salient figures in the plans and calculations of others, and thus achieve certain kinds of agency. My suggestion here is that one effective way of exploring the presence of such marginal bodies of people is to attend to the political economy of their livelihoods (Staples 2007 Staples, James. 2007. Livelihoods at the Margins Surviving the City.\nWalnut Creek\n,\nCA\n: Left Coast Press. http://public.eblib.com/EBLPublic/PublicView.do?ptiID=677831 .  [Google Scholar] ), the resources they deploy and those they present to others to demonstrate how, although often disorganised, impoverished or excluded, such groups figure in the plans and schemes of others, and thus exert influence.\nThis approach is entirely different to that taken by most anthropologists of youth. The contemporary anthropology of youth starts out with the assumption that young people are agents, while youth is a social construction (see for example Amit and Wulff 1995 Amit, Vered, and Helena Wulff, eds. 1995. Youth Cultures: A Cross-cultural Perspective.\nLondon\n: Routledge.  [Google Scholar] ). These basic commitments give the contemporary anthropology of youth a very definite focus, a product of these pre-theoretical commitments (Moore 2004 Moore, Henrietta L. 2004. “Global Anxieties: Concept-metaphors and Pre-theoretical Commitments in Anthropology.” Anthropological Theory 4 (1): 71–88. doi: 10.1177/1463499604040848 [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ). In many respects, agency and social construction are difficult to keep in one frame since the socially (that is, compulsorily) constructed nature of the person or subject might be seen to undermine her agency, if this is interpreted as a capacity for free action (Butler 2005 Butler, Judith. 2005. Giving an Account of Oneself. 1st ed.\nNew York\n: Fordham University Press. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ; see also Laidlaw 2002 Laidlaw, James. 2002. “For An Anthropology of Ethics and Freedom.” Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 8 (2): 311–332. doi: 10.1111/1467-9655.00110 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). In a previous generation of anthropology, this antimony might have been expressed in the contrast been individual and social structure (Fortes 1963 Fortes, Meyer. 1963. “Ritual and Office in Tribal Societies.” In Essays on the Ritual of Social Relations, by Daryll Forde [and Others, edited by Max Gluckman, 53–88. Manchester, Eng.]: Manchester University Press.  [Google Scholar] ). There is thus a clear tension between the terms, in that prima facie it is not clear whether or to what extent agency can be maintained, as ‘freedom’ in the face of social construction (Stern 2000 Stern, D. 2000. “The Return of the Subject?: Power, Reflexivity and Agency.” Philosophy and Social Criticism 26 (5): 109–122. doi: 10.1177/019145370002600507 [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ; Merlan 2016 Merlan, Francesca. 2016. “Women, Warfare, and the Life of Agency: Papua New Guinea and Beyond.” Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 22 (2): 392–411. doi: 10.1111/1467-9655.12405 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ; Asad 2000 Asad, Talal. 2000. “Agency and Pain: An Exploration.” Culture and Religion 1 (1): 29–60. doi: 10.1080/01438300008567139 [Taylor & Francis Online]   [Google Scholar] ; Mahmood 2001 Mahmood, Saba. 2001. “Feminist Theory, Embodiment, and the Docile Agent: Some Reflections on the Egyptian Islamic Revival.” Cultural Anthropology 16 (2): 202–236. doi: 10.1525/can.2001.16.2.202 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). Only certain theoretical directions will allow agency and social construction to operate in a complimentary way. Most important of these are broadly post-modern or conservative post-structural positions associated with the ‘interpretive turn’ in anthropology (Asad 1998 Asad, Talal, ed. 1998. Anthropology & the Colonial Encounter.\nAmherst\n,\nNY\n: Humanity Books.  [Google Scholar] ; Clifford 1986 Clifford, James. 1986. “On Ethnographic Allegory.” In Writing Culture: The Poetics and Politics of Ethnography, edited by George E. Marcus and James Clifford, 98–121.\nBerkeley\n: University of California Press.  [Google Scholar] ). These perspectives locate agency in the capacity to define identities; social construction becomes evidence of human action (as opposed to impersonal Durkheimian forces – see Said 2003 Said, Edward W. (Edward William). 2003. Orientalism. New edition. (Penguin Classics); Penguin Classics. Harmondsworth: Penguin.  [Google Scholar] ). As such the anthropology of youth focuses on the cultural positions taken up by the young, the symbolic resources they deploy to maintain them, and their effect on the overall symbolic economy of their societies. The twin commitments of the anthropology of youth, to the agency and social construction of young people – can be maintained only so long as the basic focus of the sub discipline is on identity and ‘cultural production’ (Bucholtz 2002 Bucholtz, Mary. 2002. “Youth and Cultural Practice.” Annual Review of Anthropology 31 (1): 525–552. doi: 10.1146/annurev.anthro.31.040402.085443 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). Likewise, agency can only, really, manifest itself in young people’s capacity to modify and rework the symbolic terms on which youth are represented and represent themselves (Honwana and Boeck 2005 Honwana, Alcinda, and Filip de Boeck. 2005. “Children and Youth in Africa: Agency, Identity and Place: Introduction.” In Makers & Breakers: Children & Youth in Postcolonial Africa, 1–18.\nOxford\n: James Currey.  [Google Scholar] ).\nHowever, a starting point in material social relations (as opposed to ‘social construction’) does not place the same limits on how we can think about agency (which I refuse to assume at the outset, see Laidlaw 2002 Laidlaw, James. 2002. “For An Anthropology of Ethics and Freedom.” Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 8 (2): 311–332. doi: 10.1111/1467-9655.00110 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). It gives us the opportunity to rethink agency relationally and to ask, in what relationships and contexts do young people compel others – either deliberately or unwittingly – to take account of them? The ‘agency’ revealed here is less the act of a subject, than the particular historical outcome of an intersubjective system (Toren 1999 Toren, Christina. 1999. Mind, Materiality, and History: Explorations in Fijian Ethnography. Material Cultures.\nLondon\n: Routledge. http://www.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0649/99026827-d.html .  [Google Scholar] ). To paraphrase Butler, there is no need for a unitary, prior ‘doer’ behind deeds ( 1990 Butler, Judith. 1990. Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity. Thinking Gender.\nNew York\n: Routledge.  [Google Scholar] , 1995a Butler, Judith. 1995a. “Contingent Foundations.” In Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange, 35–58.\nNew York\n: Routledge.  [Google Scholar] , 1995b Butler, Judith. 1995b. “For a Careful Reading.” In Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange, 127–144.\nNew York\n: Routledge.  [Google Scholar] ) which are effective exactly because they are committed with (or compelled by) ‘another in mind’ (Strathern 1988 Strathern, Marilyn. 1988. The Gender of the Gift: Problems with Women and Problems with Society in Melanesia. Studies in Melanesian Anthropology; 6.\nBerkeley\n: University of California Press. http://www.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0641/88014267-d.html . [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] , 272). To state the point simply, whereas a focus on identity foregrounds the ‘resistance’ of people against a system, a relational focus encourages an analysis of the co-production of people and the system in which they live, including the modes of agency which will appear in that system (Ingold 1995 Ingold, Tim. 1995. “Work, Time and Industry.” Time & Society 4 (1): 5–28. doi: 10.1177/0961463X95004001001 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ).\nI begin by outlining the socio-economic basis of the ikimotari at the level of individual motorcycle owners, riders and their customers. I go on to show how these artisanal workers are implicated in organisational and regulatory regimes which aim to constrain and control them. From these frameworks, I turn to the relationship between motorcyclists and the city authorities – a relationship which has historically been fraught, occasionally violent, and is premised on the city’s unwillingness to permit the ikimotari to continue in Kigali. While motorcyclists’ capacity to resist the pressures placed on them by elites and organs of state is extremely limited, they have nevertheless survived and prosper. As a partial explanation for the continued presence of the ikimotari in Kigali, I explore the ways in which the profession presents others with opportunities for rent-seeking, enrichment and political influence. These political contests, both visible and hidden, place motorcyclists in the city and define their ability to pursue their livelihood. That is, they demonstrate the agency of this group of young people, defined as their capacity to figure in the plans and schemes of others, to have value and social ‘weight’ – what I speak of here as ‘presence’.\nThe ikimotari in Kigali\nIn common with East Africa’s other major cities, motorcycle taxis are a ubiquitous feature of Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda. Locally called taxi-moto or simply moto, these taxis congregate at major intersections, bus stations and in marked areas throughout the city but can be hailed anywhere. A trip on a moto costs between RWF 300 and RWF 2000 (about £0.30–£2.00). Taking a moto is almost always the fastest way to move around Kigali, and for the majority of people without their own vehicles, is usually the only means of transport available in the early mornings or at night.\nMotorcycle taxis are not the only form of public transport in Kigali. The cheapest and most widely used form of transport is provided by small minibuses called matatu with a capacity of either 18 or 36. These ply set routes, usually from the town centre outwards into the suburbs. Bus fares range from RWF 100 to RWF 300. Taxicabs are also available, although they are expensive and rarely used by most people. Taxi drivers complain that they find customers only on special occasions – weddings, funerals, for trips to the airport or a big night on the town. Recently, large buses familiar from European transport systems have been introduced into Kigali, operated by Kigali Bus Services (KBS) (Oz Architecture and Kigali City Council 2013 Oz Architecture and Kigali City Council. 2013. “Kigali City Transportation Masterplan Report.” http://www.masterplan2013.kigalicity.gov.rw/downloads/Docs/RWF1101_04_Kigali%20Transportation%20Master%20Plan_04062013-s.pdf .  [Google Scholar] ).\nMotorcycles are valued because of their capacities to transport people fast, relatively cheaply, door-to-door and at all hours. Whereas buses work on designated routes, with some neighbourhoods a considerable distance from a bus route, motos are available everywhere. Unlike buses, they also drop people exactly where they want to go and operate after 9 pm, serving bars and clubs in town. These are issues of importance in a context in which to walk long distances, sweating in the heat is felt to be demeaning and in which male social life revolves around drinking in bars. Taxicabs offer a similar service, but their fares are simply too high for most people. Motos are not cheap, but even people on relatively modest incomes can afford to use them when the need arises. They also have the advantage of being able to negotiate standing traffic, a considerable issue in Kigali on arterial routes at peak times. We should not allow ourselves to lose sight of these basic dimensions of the moto sector in the analysis which follows.\nThe value of motorcycles for transport is in spite of their low social prestige. Motari operate in the context of an explicit cultural hierarchy of vehicles, in which operating – or better still owning – a vehicle confers considerable prestige. Bicycles used to transport goods and people occupy the bottom rung of this hierarchy, followed by small mopeds used for personal transport and as taxis. Motorcycles are regarded as a step up from either, but almost all of the motorcyclists I spoke to aspired to drive taxicabs in spite of the lower incomes they offer, minibuses or even trucks. The aspiration to drive a taxi was often explicitly made an issue of ‘respect’ (agaciro) by informants. Privately owned cars – preferably luxurious sedans or four-wheel drive models occupy the top of this hierarchy. 4 4  This is a somewhat simplified account, which deals with the major vehicle types in use in Kigali. It should be noted that riding a bicycle as a sport is an elite activity. Likewise, more powerful or stylish motorcycles, or even mopeds can be status symbols. Motari can salvage some relative prestige by decorating their machines with stickers and paint – commonly displaying pan-African symbolism, rappers or footballers – or even fitting elaborate LED lighting to the wheels or frame to attract ‘superstars’, cool urban youth. View all notes Not incidentally, this ordering of vehicles correlates closely with age: working as a motari is a young man’s profession, since it requires considerable strength. Correspondingly, driving a moto is not a prestigious livelihood – all the less as riders are usually dirty, dusty and dressed in layers of old jackets and sweaters at work – but one appropriate for youths and other people of low social status. Many motorcyclists complain of the ‘disrespect’ (agasuzuru) they receive from customers and officials.\nIn late 2012, there were around 10,500 registered motorcycle taxi drivers in Kigali, 5 5  I am grateful to SYTRAMORWA and FERWACOTAMO for this figure. View all notes a city of some 1.2 million people. This is almost certainly an underestimate of their true numbers, as in some areas and at certain times, large numbers of undocumented riders work, especially away from the city centre and on dirt roads. Their sheer numbers give motari importance in the city’s economy. The average household size in Kigali is 4.7 people (National Institute of Statistics 2012b National Institute of Statistics. 2012b. “Third Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey (EICV3).”  [Google Scholar] ). Interviews with motorcyclists in 2012 suggested that on average they support close to this number of people, around 4.5. That means that between 4% and 5% of the city’s population is supported by the ikimotari, or as motari put it, as a motorcyclist ‘you feed many people’ (utunze abantu benshi). 6 6  This is a claim that is in tension with motorcyclists relative (social) youth. Young people do not support households in Rwanda, where the capacity to support a family is a marker of adulthood (Sommers 2012 Sommers, Marc. 2012. Stuck : Rwandan Youth and the Struggle for Adulthood.\nAthens\n,\nDC\n: University of Georgia Press; published in association with the United States Institute of Peace.  [Google Scholar] ). Some motorcyclists are junior members of larger households to which they contribute, however a large number especially of riders who own their own machines are household heads in their own right. The claim to ‘feed many people’ is therefore in a sense a means of contesting motorcyclists’ subordinate role as ‘young people’. View all notes\nMoreover, the sector is growing rapidly. In the three years to 2011, the number of registered motorcycle taxis in Rwanda increased by more than 250% (Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency 2011 Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency. 2011. “Key Statistics Information: Transport of Persons (Road Transport).”  [Google Scholar] ). This growth has been driven in part by increased registration of motorcyclists, but also, motari claim, by a relaxation of the driving test and a considerable increase in the opportunities for testing. The growth in motos reflects a countrywide expansion in both candidates for driving tests and awarded licenses in recent years. Between 2009 and 2011 147,000 licenses were awarded – more than 70% more than there are vehicles on Rwanda’s roads (Asiimwe 2012 Asiimwe, Bosco. 2012. “Rwandans Rush to Own Driving Permits.” The New Times, February 6, sec. News.  [Google Scholar] ). Learning to drive is clearly a widely held aspiration amongst Rwandans, especially male youth. Driving a motorcycle is seen by many as a route out of poverty – and reasonably so: a motorcyclist can expect to take home between |RWF 1000 and RW 5000 a day, a good income for the poorly educated and unskilled youth who make up the bulk of Kigali’s motari.\nThe Rwandan National Institute of Statistics collects poverty data on a household basis, so it is difficult to see how these figures compare to young people in other situations. However, the national poverty line at the time of my research was RWF 118,000 per adult per year (National Institute of Statistics 2012b National Institute of Statistics. 2012a. “EICV Thematic Report: Youth.”  [Google Scholar] ). Assuming that motari belong on average a household of between four and five people, even if that household had no other workers, a motorcyclist earning just RWF 1700 a day would be able to maintain all of its members above the poverty line. The conclusion that motorcyclists are not poor is corroborated by Sommers’ ( 2012 Sommers, Marc. 2012. Stuck : Rwandan Youth and the Struggle for Adulthood.\nAthens\n,\nDC\n: University of Georgia Press; published in association with the United States Institute of Peace.  [Google Scholar] ) account of urban youth poverty. Although his data was collected in 2008 and prices have since risen, it is striking that the young people he interviewed regarded an income as adequate if it enabled them to secure lodging and buy one hot meal a day. In 2012, a one room house, often shared with at least one other working person, could cost as little as RWF 25,000 per month, while a hot meal could cost as little as RWF 500. Even a relatively unsuccessful rider can easily command these amounts of money. Of course, the livelihood of a motorcyclist is by no means as comfortable as that of the city’s emergent middle class. 7 7  The notion of ‘middle class’ should be used with great caution here. By some definitions, motorcyclists are already ‘middle class’ in terms of their consumption power (Ncube and Lufumpa 2015 Ncube, Mthuli, and Charles Leyeka Lufumpa, eds. 2015. The Emerging Middle Class in Africa.\nNew York\n,\nNY\n: Routledge.  [Google Scholar] ). However, in terms of their lifestyle, they are clearly not meaningfully middle class (Burger et al. 2015 Burger, Ronelle, Cindy Lee Steenekamp, Servaas van der Berg, and Asmus Zoch. 2015. “The Emergent Middle Class in Contemporary South Africa: Examining and Comparing Rival Approaches.” Development Southern Africa 32 (1): 25–40. doi: 10.1080/0376835X.2014.975336 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) and often teeter on the brink of a return to poverty (Visagie 2015 Visagie, Justin. 2015. “Growth of the Middle Class: Two Perspectives That Matter for Policy.” Development Southern Africa 32 (1): 3–24. doi: 10.1080/0376835X.2014.965387 [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). They are also subject to patterns of vulnerability and humiliation that are not consistent with a recognisably ‘middle class’ lifestyle (Scott 1990 Scott, James C. 1990. Domination and the Arts of Resistance: Hidden Transcripts.\nNew Haven\n: Yale University Press. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ). View all notes Riders were very well aware of this and extremely realistic about the relative monetary worth of their profession. For example, someone working as a bank teller or as a salesperson in one of the upscale supermarkets in town – a job for educated young people – would expect to earn three or four times as much as a motorcyclist, and of course undergo much less risk in the process.\nThe ikimotari is a strictly artisanal business. Most riders do not own the bikes they ride. Rather they either rent or lease them from small-scale entrepreneurs, ababosi or abakoresha, ‘bosses’ for around RWF 5000 per day. These are not relationships of employment, even though motari sometimes speak as though they were. Rather they are relationships of clientship and patronage, normally between a senior person and a younger man. Bosses can make considerable amounts of money from their relationship with motari. Over twelve months, a motorcycle leased or rented at RWF 5000 per day can return almost RWF 300,000 on an investment of RWF 1,300,000, or about 20% profit. Where bosses rent or lease bikes they have acquired second hand – for as little as 500,000 – the possible profits are much higher.\nThese relationships are highly individual. In some cases a rider’s boss is a neighbour or friend, perhaps someone with an interest in the young man and who introduces him to the business in order to advance his prospects while making a profit. In other cases, riders barely know their bosses and enter into purely monetary transactions with them. In these cases, other riders usually make the introduction or occasionally riders are connected to bosses through their co-operative organisations. A minority of riders are owner-operators, most having acquired their first machines through a lease arrangement with a boss, a few using commercial credit. Another, larger minority have no regular access to motorbikes at all and, lacking a regular boss, rely on borrowing motorcycles from other motari at the same RWF 5000 fee. In any case, riders gain access to motorcycles in individuated and sometimes closely guarded networks of friendship and patronage.\nThere are no established social systems – based on ethnicity, region, kinship or any other factor – which I could discern organising motari into wider networks beyond their particular friendships, immediate family and their bosses. Indeed, motorcyclists’ social circles are likely to be localised rather than based on their occupation. Riders I became friendly with were likely to move amongst other young people, usually in insecure employment or with no fixed source of income: market carriers, builders’ helpers, petty hustlers, car washers and drug dealers figured prominently in the peer groups of riders I knew. These friendship groups seemed more often than not to be based on where a rider lived, rather than anchored in circle of colleagues. 8 8  See Sommers ( 2012 Sommers, Marc. 2012. Stuck : Rwandan Youth and the Struggle for Adulthood.\nAthens\n,\nMD\n: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers.  [Google Scholar] ) and Latour ( 1993 Latour, Bruno. 1993. We Have Never Been Modern.\nCambridge\n,\nMA\n: Harvard University Press.  [Google Scholar] ), both of whom have argued that the relentless focus on the relation between individuals and a system – typically conceptualised as society or culture – places serious constraints on our ability to comprehend social life. For both theorists, the ‘purification’ (Latour 1993 Laidlaw, James. 2002. “For An Anthropology of Ethics and Freedom.” Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 8 (2): 311–332. doi: 10.1111/1467-9655.00110 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ) of a social field to reveal individuals as points of autonomous agency is simultaneously to render invisible the relationships that make that agency possible. Hence for Latour, a focus on human agency neglects the agency of non-human systems in constituting it. Similarly for Strathern, attributing an act to a specific author erases the chain of action that made that authorship possible (Strathern 2001 Strathern, Marilyn. 2001. “The Patent and the Malanggan.” Theory, Culture and Society 18 (4): 1–26. doi: 10.1177/02632760122051850 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). In both cases, those elements of a situation that are erased in the effort to identify agency are relegated to a non-agentive or constraining context or system against which people appear to act (Strathern 2003 Strathern, Marilyn. 2003. “Redescribing Society.” Minerva 41: 263–276. doi: 10.1023/A:1025586327342 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). In this vein, Graeber ( 2001 Graeber, David. 2001. Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of Our Own Dreams.\nNew York\n: Palgrave. [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ) has argued for a reconceptualization of social science that would remove completely the distinction between individual and society, and thus between agency and structure, in favour of a vision of social life as a system in operation, where agency and events are multiply constructed out of the actions of others. In short, to act is always to stand in relation to someone or something else as the condition of acting.\nNaturally, there is nothing specific to studies of youth about these theoretical positions. They become pressing insofar as anthropologists and other scholars of youth oppose the young to other sections of society, social structures or cultural systems that constrain or control them and against which their agency is manifest. In fact, the entire architecture of ‘youth cultural agency’ outlined in the introduction to this paper stands in stark contrast to the kind of theoretical positions mapped out by Strathern, Latour and Graeber.\nHence, at a methodological level, this reading of agency suggests that it is a mistake to isolate youth from other domains of social life. It is common, for example, to distinguish ‘youth cultures’ from ‘adult society’ and then to enter into an analysis of the way in which youth cultures demonstrate the agency of youth in the appropriation and modification of ‘adult’ norms and values (Blackman 2005 Blackman, Shane. 2005. “Youth Subcultural Theory: A Critical Engagement with the Concept, Its Origins and Politics, from the Chicago School to Postmodernism.” Journal of Youth Studies 8 (1): 1–20. doi: 10.1080/13676260500063629 [Taylor & Francis Online]   [Google Scholar] ). Yet the distinction between youth and adult social spheres can never be more than an artefact of an analytical perspective. It is just as fruitless to try to define ‘women’s social lives’ from the lives of their menfolk: these things, viewed at a wider angle, are necessarily intertwined and mutually constitutive (Strathern 1980 Strathern, Marilyn. 1980. “No Nature, No Culture: The Hagen Case.” In Nature, Culture and Gender, edited by Carol P. MacCormack and Marilyn Strathern, 174–222.\nCambridge\n: Cambridge University Press.  [Google Scholar] , 1988 Strathern, Marilyn. 1988. The Gender of the Gift: Problems with Women and Problems with Society in Melanesia. Studies in Melanesian Anthropology; 6.\nBerkeley\n: University of California Press. http://www.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0641/88014267-d.html . [Crossref]   [Google Scholar] ; Abu-Lughod 1990 Abu-Lughod, Lila. 1990. “The Romance of Resistance: Tracing Transformations of Power through Bedouin Women.” American Ethnologist 17 (1): 41–55. doi: 10.1525/ae.1990.17.1.02a00030 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] ). This is not to say that either young people, or women are unimportant to a given social formation. It is rather to recognise that even the subsidiary elements in a system shape that system in significant ways (Scott 1998 Scott, James C. 1998. Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed. Yale Agrarian Studies.\nNew Haven\n: Yale University Press. http://www.h-net.org/review/hrev-a0a9o0-aa .  [Google Scholar] ). How women relate to men is generally recognised as more significant than the fact that there are women (Moore 1999 Moore, Henrietta L. 1999. “Whatever Happened to Women and Men? Gender and Other Crises in Anthropology.” In Anthropological Theory Today, 151–171.\nCambridge\n: Polity Press.  [Google Scholar] ); likewise, the relation of young people to their seniors should surely by granted more significance than what young people do in their putatively independent cultural worlds.\nThus, just as feminist anthropology has effectively shifted its methodological stance from a focus on women to a focus on gender relations, it may be time for the anthropology of youth to abandon the notion that attending to young people and their actions is an adequate basis for accounting for the various social phenomena we term ‘youth’. Very often it is the lot of the young to be dominated and exploited by people older and better connected than they are. This does not mean that young people do not matter, or that we must strive to isolate this neglected population in opposition to others; it simply calls for the acknowledgement that the agency of youth is manifest more in the ways they are co-opted for the schemes of others, perhaps, as here, related to the patterns of their livelihoods, than in their independent exercise of will. That is, young people are more significant in their presence than in their capacity for independent and unconstrained action.\nAcknowledgements\nI wish to thank colleagues who attended the 2013 Centre for Anthropological Research on Childhood, Youth and Education workshop, especially Phil Mizen and Ginny Morrow, for their helpful comments.

Wide use of modern IT technologies enables cyber attacks to disrupt the operation of ICS. Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) are the most threatening attacks to ICS due to their long persistence and destructive cyber-physical effects to ICS. This paper considers a simulation of attackers and defenders of an ICS, where the defender must consider the cost-effectiveness of implementing defensive measures within the system in order to create an optimal defense. The aim is to identify the appropriate deployment of a specific defensive strategy, such as defense-in-depth or critical component defense. The problem is represented as a strategic competitive optimisation problem, which is solved using a co-evolutionary particle swarm optimisation algorithm.

Planning and scheduling activities relevant to the rail industry.\nThe think tank group was made up of senior representatives of Network Rail and other corporate partners of the wider AUTONOM project. Of particular interest to this group was the area of planning and scheduling in relation to autonomous systems and the potential advantages such systems can bring. The four areas shown in Figure 1 demonstrate the potential for automation and have been highlighted as priority areas by Network Rail and the authors. The following subject areas are investigated in more detail in relation to the elements outlined in Figure 1 .\nAutonomous systems\nSuch systems may range from semi-automated to totally autonomous (without human intervention) operation. Semi-automated operation includes European train control system (ETCS) in-cab signalling and automated train braking systems. Fully automated operation examples include the automated operation of trains.\nData mining\nThe practice of data mining is the identification of structural patterns in data and links between data points that are not readily discoverable. Rail industry data collected from train-based and wayside sensors provide a vast potential repository for data mining.\nKnowledge engineering frameworks\nKnowledge engineering is similar to the discipline of software engineering; it turns the process of constructing knowledge-based systems from an art into an engineering discipline. Such practice is required in the design of new information management systems for rail.\nExpert and decision support systems\nAn expert system is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert; they can also provide decision-making support. A decision support system aids a user in their decision-making by providing possible solutions for a problem area. Decision support can be seen in the use of more sophisticated rail scheduling software.\nSemantic technologies\nOntologies can be thought of as maps between vocabularies that allow document creators to know how to describe their documents. The wide variety of protocols for the transfer of data in rail applications provides the opportunity for semantic description of such data to aid interoperability.\nPlanning and scheduling: Approaches that can be applied\nSection:\nPlanning and scheduling is a wide subject area relating to both manufacturing and service industries (Pinedo 1 ). In manufacturing one of the most common uses of scheduling is in the flow shop. Cheng et al. 2 describe such a case where the scheduling of jobs through batch processing machines is considered. Within the rail industry scheduling can apply to a variety of topics as evidenced in Figure 1 . The work of Cao et al. 3 examines the problem of mixed-speed train scheduling on a high-speed line; where the flow of trains, travelling at different rates along a rail line, must be continuous. Rail maintenance scheduling has been addressed by Lautala and Pouryousef 4 who describe a preventive maintenance scheduling problem modelling approach for preventative maintenance. In this approach parameters related to specific line specifications, drawn from three high-speed line case studies, are defined as a series of descriptive analytical tables. One of the more recent areas for investigation in relation to rail industry scheduling problems has been the use of soft computing techniques. Hu et al. 5 propose a scheduling approach utilising a particle swarm algorithm to optimise the scheduling within an urban rail network, based on data hosted in a cloud repository.\nAutonomous systems\nAutonomous systems can contain complex control logic often incorporating computational intelligence techniques such as fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms. Such systems are linked to physical objects to provide sensing capabilities, to control the motion of mobile hardware assets and activities of both fixed and mobile assets. Agents are one avenue of research for the autonomous control of assets. Agents are said to embody two principles: an ability to act autonomously and the capability to interact with other agents (Wooldridge 6 ). Multi-agent systems are then, by definition, interacting collections of agents (Wooldridge 6 ).\nFisher 7 has investigated the design and evaluation of agents providing a framework for the temporal execution of agent designs. This work was motivated by the lack of such a framework and methods to assess the actual behaviour of agents once designed.\nLearning algorithms have also been employed in the control of autonomous systems. Reinforcement learning is likened by Sutton 8 to a mapping between situations and actions in response to a reward. Reinforcement learning is prominent in autonomous control research and agent theory. Policy search is a technique from the area of reinforcement learning in which a probability distribution is assigned to a set of possible actions. Deisenroth and Rasmussen 9 put forward an approach for data-efficient policy search and apply it to control tasks such as the cart-pole learning task.\nThe subject of autonomous real-time planning has been investigated by Cresswell et al. 10 in their work on the learning object-centred models system. Automated planning has also been investigated by Fernandez et al. 11 who propose an architecture for the automation of data mining tasks. Again the Planning Domain Definition language features heavily in this approach. The papers included in this section so far, while not currently applied to rail uses, do hold some potential for further investigation with regards to autonomous rail research. There are only limited investigations into full autonomous operation within the railway industry, usually concentrating on automatic operation of metro/light rail systems as in Dominguez et al. 12 and Wackrow and Slamen. 13 Opportunities exist to review maintenance planning and scheduling, among other activities, with a view to autonomous or semi-autonomous operation.\nData mining\nThe area of data mining has increased in importance in-line with the increasing ability for information systems to capture and preserve data. In tandem with this is the maturing of computational intelligence techniques used for the identification of patterns in the collected data (Witten and Frank 14 ). The rail industry is both a producer of data and a user of the knowledge extracted from such data sets.\nThe work of Goverde and Meng 15 utilises train describer records (describer records contain operational information about the track and train movements) to improve the performance of infrastructure and train services. This paper outlines tools for the mining of train describer data, and its analysis, for the purpose of increasing capacity, punctuality and reliability while improving safety. Of interest in this area is the mining of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data. SCADA systems are employed in a range of industrial scenarios including rail (Hadžiosmanovic et al. 16 ). The work of Hadžiosmanovic et al. 16 mines SCADA data in a workflow-centric manner with regard to the identification of anomalous log traces that could indicate incorrect use of the system or a potential security breach.\nThe mining of rail data in the form of business processes is explored by Kecman and Goverde. 17 Train describer event data is mined by a process mining tool to provide a more informed analysis of potential train path conflicts (to minimise disruptions to trains in the network and improve safety). Business process mining aims to rediscover a process from event log data (recorded executions of business processes) typically drawn from enterprise software systems. The practice of business process mining is further described in Van der Aalst and Weijters 18 and a range of techniques are referenced in Tiwari et al. 19\nKnowledge engineering frameworks and ontology\nKnowledge engineering concerns the practice of designing and building knowledge-based systems. In the opinion of Studer et al. 20 the practice of knowledge engineering (KE) should adopt formal structured approaches inherent in a discipline such as software engineering. In essence KE has, since the work of Studer et al., 20 become a discipline that has its own set of frameworks and methodological approach. Studer et al. 20 mentions three frameworks for knowledge engineering: CommonKADS, MIKE and PROTEGE-II.\nA critical component of KE is the use of semantic technologies utilising XML meta-descriptions of objects and ontologies, enabling an enhanced level of contextual meaning to be expressed through knowledge systems. Ontologies, in particular, have had a significant role to play in semantic web technologies and in the use of computational intelligence techniques in KE. Ontologies can be thought of as a type of dictionary that links together corresponding words in different vocabularies, allowing document creators to know how best to describe their documents. As Antoniou and van Harmelen 21 put it ‘an ontology consists of a finite list of terms and the relationships between these terms’. This can make such documents, at least partially, machine understandable with the application of artificial intelligence algorithms.\nThe case for the use of ontologies in rail industry applications is made by Easton et al.; 22 in that the proliferation of legacy systems in the industry together with the range of alternative terms used by different parties to refer to the same entity make ontology use highly desirable. An example use of ontologies in the rail industry is given by Briola et al. 23 These authors utilise ontologies, along with natural language processing, to manage traffic control within a railway network (using representative test data sets). Work by Zarri et al. 24 examines the generation of business rules from a semantic knowledge system for use in the checking of hazardous materials being transported by rail. In this work the ontological approach aids the development and structuring of If/Then rules concerning the checking of hazardous materials transported in rail wagons.\nSemantic technologies\nSemantic technologies rely on ontologies for their definition and context. Semantic languages often employ XML as a framework due to its ability to provide a structured meta-description for combination with or attachment to another digital object. Bousse et al. 25 extend one such semantic language, SysML (systems modeling language), for use with rail safety systems. The case study described by Bousse et al. 25 concerns a railway crossing controller made up of a set of sensors fitted to a level crossing. The SysML specification is modified with suitable additions to describe the correct monitoring and functioning of the crossing. The modelling of such safety control systems in the rail industry may be carried out in a language such as UML. Berkenkötter and Hannemann 26 outline an approach utilising UML 2.0 for such a task, utilising semantic descriptions. The use of such a modelling paradigm with a semantic XML description could provide a powerful tool for the exploration, verification and enforcement of a control system. Network Rail have also been investigating the use of the IEC 61850 standard used by the electrical supply industry in their use of XML coding as a communication interface between power supply systems and controllers (Burnham 27 ) with the aim of being able to remotely monitor the condition of suitably equipped power supply systems within the network.\nSemantic process mining is another recent extension of an existing technique with ontological and semantic capabilities. Jareevongpiboon and Janecek 28 concentrate on the direct addition of semantics to business processes. With this technique business process event logs are annotated with ontologically defined concept descriptions. A number of ontological resources are utilised for the annotation: a domain ontology (for the domain concerning the business processes); company ontology (containing company-specific definitions) and definitions from relevant databases (Jareevongpiboon and Janecek). 28\nSemantic technologies provide a new method of data description for potential use in the rail industry. Many data interchange standards still exist in the rail networks of Europe and semantics provide the potential for providing a harmonised way of exchanging information between different systems; a useful requirement, considering the range of technologies being introduced in both rail vehicles and trackside, when considering their intelligent control.\nExpert and decision support systems\nExpert systems within the rail industry can take many forms and may be used to address a number of areas. Saa et al. 29 outline an ontology-driven expert decision support system for the design of railway electrification systems. This approach is based on the development of a knowledge database composed of expert views and used to inform the design process. The intended automation of the collection and use of expert views will be facilitated though the further development and use of a rules engine. Such systems may also be autonomous in their operation, and are often employed in the task of monitoring assets. Palte 30 makes the point that remote vehicle monitoring systems, for rail vehicles, must be capable of communicating their collected data and analysis in an informative and appropriate way to interested parties; Palte 30 presents a commentary of a number of salient factors for designers of such monitoring systems to take into account. Zhang 31 puts forward a framework for the monitoring of maintenance, repair and operation (MRO) activities regarding high-speed trains. This approach, based on the use of radio frequency identification sensors, utilises complex event processing and semantics to evaluate the efficiency of MRO activities. Condition monitoring of rail vehicles is also the subject of the work of Firlik et al. 32 who examine light rail systems from this perspective. This paper examines the dynamic adjustment of maintenance needs and track speed limits based on sensor readings from axle boxes. Such autonomous functionality is still new in the rail industry, with only the most recent papers giving serious attention to it.\nIntelligent decision support systems are now becoming a reality in the rail industry. Ngigi et al. 33 detail the progress in predictive control methods and their relevance to condition monitoring activities related to rail. Such systems can be used to support decisions on when to perform maintenance and renewals tasks. In particular a class of algorithms known as model predictive control (MPC) attempt to optimise future behaviour of assets by computing a sequence of modified actions. One such control method is the Kalman filter, which has been utilised in the assessment of the dynamic performance of rail vehicle components while in motion. In addition wheelset condition monitoring (WCM) systems are now used to assess a range of wheel-related degradation instances and include systems such as: wheel impact detectors, hot axle bearing detection, brake pad inspection systems and automatic vehicle identification systems. The authors acknowledge that the combination of WCM and simulation techniques is required for high-performance real-time condition monitoring of rail vehicles and the support of maintenance decisions.\nOne interesting development, with possible application to safety uses in the rail industry, is the introduction of the European GALILEO satellite navigation system. This system will potentially be a rival for the global positioning system (GPS) and, unlike standard GPS, will in time be certified for use in railway safety applications (Beugin et al. 34 ). The work of Beugin et al. 34 envisages a time when all trains will be fitted with intelligent communication systems capable of transmitting their real-time position and health to control centres. Safety-critical situations, such as velocity of a train in speed-restricted sections of lines and location of a train within signalling blocks, are potential application areas for real-time location technology (Beugin et al. 34 ).\nPlanning and scheduling applied to rail research subject areas\nSection:\nTimetable planning\nTimetable planning is an active area of research for the rail industry. The work of Yang et al. 35 investigates the development of incomplete cyclic timetables for trains. Real-time re-scheduling of trains is the subject of Wegele et al., 36 where genetic algorithms are used to perform a heuristic re-ordering of trains when delays are encountered in the rail network. The mark-up language RailML is also mentioned in this work. RailML is a metadata language, utilising XML, which defines a set of common rail-specific terminology as meta descriptions. RailML is only mentioned in a few papers at present (RailML is detailed in Nash et al. 37 ). The practice behind train dispatching is outlined by Kuckelberg and Wendler 38 who aim to address the conflicts that arise when trains block each other due to delays. These authors provide an algorithmic software tool incorporating a strategy building approach to conflict resolution and a system framework.\nThe timetabling problem is framed by Ho et al., 39 as one of multi-objective optimisation in that a feasible solution must be identified within a limited time constraint that satisfies a number of objectives. Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is used to design a timetable for a railway network that operates as an open market (an open market network usually consists of an infrastructure provider and a number of competing train operating companies). In PSO optimisation each particle in a swarm represents a potential solution to an optimisation problem through its location within the swarm (Ho et al. 39 ). The optimisation of timetables has also been addressed by Forsgren et al. 40 who provide an optimisation tool that is also capable of conflict resolution. In this approach, existing timetables are fed in and then optimised while still allowing timetable planners to make their own adjustments. Albrecht et al. 41 take an approach to timetable revision that involves the use of a problem space search heuristic to generate alternative solutions. This approach is particularly relevant to re-scheduling situations due to track and infrastructure maintenance needs. The simulation of rail systems to aid planning and timetable design has been investigated by Besinovic et al. 42 who aim to determine real train running time and speed profiles. In the work of Pellegrini et al., 43 who propose a simulation model utilising mixed-integer linear programming, the area of train routing and scheduling for complex rail junctions is explored. This research aims to achieve optimised routing for trains in the event of unexpected disruptions to track availability. Different levels of granularity (locking of routes and of just track sections) were considered. The locking of track sections involved in the finer granularity gave higher-quality solutions (shorter delays). In future work the authors aim to use the model in a rolling-horizon framework. The mixed integer linear programing construct is also deployed in a simulation by Rudan et al. 44 who investigate the area of dynamic railway scheduling. A number of constraints are considered in this work describing the normal scheduled operation of trains, including time taken at junctions, dwell time at stations and timetabled journey commencement. On average a 30% reduction in delays can be achieved using this approach. Another advantage of this approach is its ability to highlight the most delay-prone trains in the network. Additional work in this area includes Ruan et al. 45 who utilise a genetic algorithm approach to determine the parameters that should be examined by a rail system simulation, in terms of safety-critical operation.\nA salient point is made by Crevier et al. 46 in that the financially viable operation of rail networks normally involves the inclusion of freight services and that such services can present scheduling challenges. The combination of network scheduling and pricing is considered in this work with a mixed-integer approach presented and the consideration of two pricing policies, disjoint (separate prices are given for each itinerary) and common (where a common tariff is used for all itineraries). From this research, it was found that a disjoint pricing policy provided more revenue, with future work concentrating on the ability of the customer to select a tariff. This research is one of the few works to consider profitable freight pricing with scheduling.\nThe area of rail yards is in part the subject of Marinov et al. 47 who examine the use of simulation software to model rail timetable and network management decisions. This paper describes common yard types and approaches to modelling common factors such as wagon speeds, section lengths and train manoeuvring parameters. The further work of Marinov and Viegas 48 examines the simulation of rail freight by examining the rail network as a set of entities (such as yards, stations, lines) and looks at the queuing situations at each entity.\nScheduling of trains in terms of energy-efficiency goals is another active area of interest and one such approach is described in the work of Hu et al. 5 This approach utilises a combination of a standard multi-objective optimisation algorithm and a fuzzy multi-objective optimisation approach to find train allocations and movements that balance fuel efficiency with passenger travel time. Timetable and planning robustness related to the movement of long-haul trains is the subject of the work of Pudney et al. 49 who utilise a Monte Carlo approach to locomotive movements in the Australian rail network.\nTrain control systems\nOne of the major developments in train control systems in recent years has been the European rail traffic management system (ERTMS). The ERTMS system is composed of two main entities, the European train control system (ETCS) and global system for mobile communications-railway (GSM-R) (Abed 50 ). ETCS is comprised of two main components, the automatic train protection system (automated emergency braking at red signals) and signalling system (in-cab signalling). GSM-R is an international standard for mobile voice and data communication transmission in a railway environment and primarily used for train to control centre communication. The different levels of ERTMS are detailed in Abed. 50\nAn interesting paper in the area of certification of ERTMS systems for installation in European rail networks has been produced by Jabri et al. 51 This paper puts forward a method based on a combination of UML (Unified Modelling Language) and Petri nets for this purpose.\nAlternative train control systems are being developed outside of Europe. In Baba et al. 52 the advanced train administration and communications system is outlined. This system, developed by Hitachi and the East Japan Railway Company, operates in a similar way to ERTMS and corresponds to level 3 of the European system (Baba et al. 52 ).\nEnergy conservation is another recent topic for research within the field of train control systems. According to Xun et al. 53 there are four types of energy saving actions that can take place within train operation.\nEnergy efficient train driving style.\nCoordination of trains in real-time.\nTimetabling for energy efficiency.\nInclusion of energy efficiency goals in planning activities.\nXun et al. 53 point to the use of re-generative breaking to contribute to energy savings and define two types of control for this mode; train dwell time and train running time (these two types are discussed in more detail in Wong and Ho 54 ). Xun et al. 53 stress the importance of fully automated operation of trains running within such an energy-efficient system. Further work by Park et al. 55 examines the prediction of energy consumption related to the driving of electric trains in the Korean rail network through the utilisation of simulation techniques. An optimal train driving strategy is also put forward by Bocharnikov et al. 56 who examine this area in relation to electrically powered suburban railways. This technique utilises a genetic algorithm to identify optimal train trajectories from a set of simulations. In addition energy-efficient driving of trains is the subject of the work of Ke et al. 57 who look at this subject in relation to rapid transit systems with the aim of optimising speed of service with the need for reduced energy consumption.\nThe modelling and verification of control systems for high-speed trains is a necessary step in the assurance of the safe operation of modern rail lines. Lv et al. 58 put forward such a model capable of describing hybrid systems that compose most modern high-speed train control systems. Train protection systems and the problem of train over-speed has been the subject of research by Guo et al. 59 In this work the authors describe the simulation of a train protection system with the aim of reducing the development time of a working real life system.\nAlthough this area is dominated by ERTMS and ETCS, it should be noted that additional systems are also relevant in the delivery of safe and efficient train control, such as those involved in efficient driving strategies for rail vehicles.\nRailway infrastructure\nIncreasingly the rail industry is looking to autonomous and intelligent systems to address the maintenance needs of its infrastructure. According to Dadashi et al. 59 this introduction of intelligent infrastructure has been brought about by the need to move from reactive to diagnostic and prognostic modes of railway maintenance where faults are predicted and potentially designed out of the system (Dadashi et al. 60 ). Three main uses of intelligent infrastructure have been highlighted by Dadashi et al.: 60\ndata acquisition: to obtain data from fixed assets such as signals, bridges and points;\nhealth assessment: to ascertain the health status of the aforementioned fixed assets;\nadvisory notification: to deliver diagnostic and prognostic information to operators and add to a decision support knowledge base.\nFurther to these definitions Dadashi et al. 60 provides an outline data processing framework for intelligent railway infrastructure. Rail inspection is a substantive topic for research; Popović et al. 61 gives a comprehensive overview of the subject with regard to common rail defects. Rail maintenance is also the subject of Bouillaut et al. 62 who provide an approach and a decision support tool for the reliability maintenance of underground rail tracks. The approach taken in this work is to utilise a Bayesian network for the modelling of maintenance strategies to detect and prevent broken rails. In addition the work of Guler 63 describes a decision support system for railway track maintenance and renewal programmes, which is comprised of rules developed from interviews with track experts and secondary research sources. Nystrom and Soderholm 64 present a method for the prioritisation of railway maintenance actions. Zhao et al. 65 also examine scheduling activities in the form of synchronised rail track component renewal. In this work they utilise a genetic algorithm approach to optimise track renewal activities; thus, minimising the cost incurred and track possession time.\nThe automated inspection of rail track is the subject of the work of Li et al. 66 who present a method to detect track components using a computer-vision-based system. In addition GPS data along with a distance measurement instrument are used to improve the accuracy of track components detection. Rail ties and anchors are vital components in the attachment of rails to track. These components must be in a good maintenance condition and have the correct spacing to make the track safe. The system can achieve up to 99% accuracy in the identification of rail ties. Future work includes the use of a modified imaging system and improved track illumination in order to reduce the number of false-positive readings recorded. Another example of automated track inspection is given by Resendiz et al. 67 who have developed an algorithm that can identify periodically occurring track components. Signal processing and a spectral estimation technique are used in the development of the technique. The MUSIC (multiple signal classification) technique was selected in this research due to its ability to detect multiple repeating instances in data streams containing noise. Future work aims to develop the system to a level of accuracy where it can operate autonomously.\nA major safety concern for rail networks is the stability of the track. In the work of Ahmad et al. 68 a track stability management tool is developed for the assessment of temperature and amount of track deformation. A margin of safety, along with a range of allowable temperature tolerances for tracks, has been calculated in this work that allows for decisions to be made on when maintenance teams are to be sent out on inspections and when the setting of speed limits in hot weather is appropriate.\nTrack geometry inspection technology is the subject of the work of Li et al. 69 who propose a neural network technique to recognise complex patterns between track geometry and vehicle response. Their performance-based track geometry inspection system relates track geometry and vehicle speed to actual vehicle performance in real-time. This system has been tested against historical data of past derailments and vehicle performance issues related to track geometry.\nOne novel development for rail maintenance is the use of handheld computers to display rail-specific special information such as track layouts (Dadashi et al. 70 ). Such a system could be used to highlight danger areas and prominent landmarks to line workers who do not have local knowledge of a particular work site. Dadashi et al. 70 put forward the point that electronic layouts are more practical than paper-based ones for night working and working in bad weather conditions.\nSignalling systems\nBeyond the area of train control systems, such as ETCS, considerable research has been carried out in the area of signalling and its analysis for safety-related purposes. The work of Filip et al. 71 examines the use of global navigation satellite systems (GNNS) in relation to railway safety applications. In this study the authors examine the applicability of existing GNSS technologies and their modes for use in the railway industry, highlighting their current limitations. As Filip et al. 72 mentions satellite technology will have a significant impact on the railways, in that the trackside sensor equipment (such as Balaises and hot box sensors) will be superseded by asset-located sensors that determine the actual real-time position via satellite. Filip et al. 72 go on to mention the European Galileo satellite system currently under development and its applicability to railway signalling.\nAs mentioned already railway signalling research has been conducted involving areas such as satellite technology 71 , 72 though there has also been an investigation into the use of Internet protocol for the control of signals reducing the need for the installation of traditional copper wiring (Endo et al. 73 ). The general trend in signalling research is that the real-time location and monitoring of rail asset condition as data inputs to signalling systems is now on the near horizon; though knowledge of the impact on planning and scheduling activities brought about by this new paradigm is not as well-developed. One of the more relevant works in this direction is that of Lai and Wang 74 who address capacity planning from the perspective of new signalling systems and track layout designs. A paper of particular interest as a primer for further planning and scheduling research is that of Dicembre and Ricci 75 who investigate the effect of factors such as signalling and capacity on high-density urban rail corridors. In summary, in the European rail sector, although ETCS (in-train cab signal system) is seen as the future for many main lines it is likely that for cost, and in some cases logistical reasons, traditional track side signalling equipment will remain in branch lines for many decades. This necessitates the need for ongoing maintenance and renewal of such track side assets.\nMaintenance\nAs mentioned by Dadashi et al. 60 there has been a move from reactive to diagnostic and prognostic modes of railway maintenance; where fault diagnosis and prediction are key. As part of this movement work has been conducted into the area of fault states and the interdependencies between the states in Schöbel and Maly. 76 This paper makes clear the need for active monitoring of rail vehicles so logical connections between fault states can be made and acted upon in a timely manner.\nAs in the work of Dadashi et al. 70 (discussed in the infrastructure section) data from assets deployed in the field can increasingly be made available to mobile devices. Bye 77 details the use of mobile devices and the design of application interfaces with case studies drawn from the UK infrastructure provider Network Rail.\nThe subject of risk-centred maintenance is investigated by Selvik and Aven. 78 These authors make the point that reliability-centred maintenance for preventative maintenance practice is well understood in industry, though it does present limitations when used to quantify risk and uncertainty in projects. In order to address this limitation the authors introduce the reliability and risk-centred maintenance framework that provides a methodology for the communication and quantification of risk in maintenance practice. In general a good review of scheduling techniques for preventative maintenance is provided by Soh et al. 79\nThe importance of organisational design in railway maintenance operations is highlighted by Jiang et al. 80 Maintenance operations may be performed by a collection of co-operating organisations, having a model of how such organisations operate together is, in the opinion of Jiang et al. 80 essential. Jiang et al. 80 put forward the OperA + framework, which is an agent-based framework allowing for the creation of dynamic representations of organisational interaction. Such an agent-based approach is said, by Jiang et al. 80 to provide a more accurate model of both real life and future organisation interaction scenarios.\nThe scheduling of rail maintenance teams is the subject of the work of Peng et al. 81 where a time–space network is proposed to optimise the assignment of workers. A number of constraints, drawn from industry practice, are proposed in this work, such as: time windows, travel costs, and parallel execution of projects. Local search algorithms are utilised to solve sub-divisions of the problem space. The work has been applied to a railroad network and has outperformed industry standard manual practices. In future work the authors propose the inclusion of further constraints reflecting latest practice in the rail industry.\nIn Peng et al. 82 the optimal routing and scheduling of periodic inspections in a rail network are explored in the context of long-term planning. A heuristic algorithm is put forward as part of this research that utilises a local search method, thereby allowing for the scheduling problem to be divided into sub sets, as in similar work by Peng and Ouyang. 83 Improved results are found over existing manual techniques, although this approach is only able to add new tasks at the end of the schedule rather than within the schedule.\nSchlake et al. 84 makes the point that wayside monitoring of railcars is essential for the enablement of predictive maintenance practice. This research looked at the economic impact of train delays and the effect of introducing lean production methods on mainline railway operations to improve railcar inspection processes facilitated by monitoring equipment. The cost savings provided by improved maintenance practices were estimated by this study at over $15,000,000 a year.\nThe work of Hajibabai et al. 85 focuses on the mining of data collected from rail carriages utilising wheel impact load detectors and wheel profile detectors. A regression analysis was performed to predict with 90% efficiency high impact wheel train stops within a 30 day period.\nIncreasingly industry is looking towards the provision of support service packages to complement the products that they sell. This product service system approach (which is expanded on in Baines et al. 86 ) involves manufacturers having to calculate the cost of maintaining products over set periods of time. Dersin and Valenzuela 87 describe the use of Petri nets to model the maintenance costs inherent in a rail system. The Petri net models are used in conjunction with a policy planning tool to simulate the processes required for different maintenance policies.\nThe area of semantics and their use in maintenance practice is the research subject of Matsokis et al. 88 A great deal of maintenance-related data held on assets is not described and recorded in any uniform way at present; the work of Matsokis et al. 88 aims to address this issue by providing an ontology model for maintenance practice. Although the authors have not expressly based their work in the rail industry, the applicability of their methodology is implied.\nOpportunities with semantic technology\nSection:\nAs mentioned earlier, the value of knowledge-based systems in the rail industry is rapidly increasing. The use of ontologies and semantic technology increases the potential usefulness of data stores and legacy data repositories. The ability to draw meaning from data in a context-relevant fashion is becoming a new research focus in the industry and is of direct relevance for the development of autonomous systems for rail.\nThe mining of text resources for knowledge has received considerable attention in recent years. In particular, the area of web mining has become popular with organisations using data mining techniques to identify solutions to problems from web-based materials. One such approach is put forward by Thorleuchter and van den Poel 89 who investigate the use of web mining to discover new technological developments based on optimised parameter values. Such a technique could be valuable in the rail industry for the identification of potential solutions from proprietary data sources. Due to the array of potential data sources in the rail industry a web mining approach may allow for unified access to these sources.\nWeb mining is of great relevance to the rail industry as both web and rail industry sources of information may possess varying degrees of structure. Web mining largely involves the mining of unstructured context-rich information from a variety of text-based sources (Cambria et al. 90 ). The mining of personal opinions is one such target of web mining techniques. Cambria et al. 90 explore the subject of sentiment analysis, in which the meaning of personal opinions on social blogs and other sources are sought, using a combination of data mining and other computational techniques.\nIn similar work Mostafa 91 uses text mining coupled with a Lexicon (dictionary) containing words with known sentiment descriptions to mine consumer sentiments about brands recorded in social blogs. Cruz et al. 92 also explore the area of opinion mining using a domain-oriented approach. In their approach Cruz et al. 92 opinions are extracted from user-generated product reviews. The authors find that domain-oriented approaches produce more accurate opinion extraction systems; their approach also utilises a method to determine the polarity and strength of the polarity of reviews. The work of Robaldo and Di Caro 93 is notable here as they provide an XML mark-up language for use in opinion mining called OpinionMining-ML.\nA final example of the use of ontologies in the management of rail systems is provided by Briola et al. 23 who present a semantic architecture for the centralised control of railway traffic. One of the main advantages of this system is the ability for a user to make natural language queries on the data being collected. Two key objectives of this approach are to reduce the overall cost of managing the rail system through autonomous or semi-autonomous operation and the ability to make real-time changes to train movements and their scheduling when encountering problems that may lead to service disruption such as faulty trains and damage within the infrastructure (Briola et al. 23 ).\nAn Analysis of Planning and Scheduling Papers\nSection:\nAlthough the papers reviewed in this paper have been assigned to particular headings based on their central concept many benefit from more than one approach. Table 1 shows a number of opportunities for the use of different technologies within rail industry planning and scheduling activities. From Table 1 it was possible to construct a pie chart of the literature review papers relating to planning and scheduling activities within the rail industry based on the technologies that they utilised. Figure 2 demonstrates that 58% of the papers feature expert and decision support systems, with 14% utilising semantic technologies. From this analysis it can also be seen that more recent papers are now referring to autonomous applications, though they are mainly restricted to applications such as the automatic or semi-automatic operation of metro systems.\n""","0.20214856","""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0954409714565654""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

However treatment of these pathologies can only be achieved through conventional means. This paper describes the next generation WCE with increased functionality to enable targeted drug delivery in the small intestinal tract. A prototype microrobot fabricated in Nylon 6 is presented which is capable of resisting peristaltic pressure through the deployment of an integrated holding mechanism and delivering targeted therapy. The holding action is achieved by extending an “anchor” spanning a 60.4 mm circumference, for an 11.0 mm diameter WCE. This function is achieved by a mechanism that occupies only 347.0 mm3 volume, including mechanics and actuator. A micropositioning mechanism is described which utilises a single micromotor to radially position and then deploy a needle 1.5 mm outside the microrobot’s body to deliver a 1 mL dose of medication to a targeted site. An analysis of the mechanics required to drive the holding mechanism is presented and an overview of microactuators and the state of the art in WCE is discussed. It is envisaged that this novel functionality will empower the next generation of WCE to help diagnose and treat pathologies of the GI tract.\n1. Introduction\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a long-term condition of the GI tract. The most common forms of this inflammatory condition are Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis which can affect the colon and small intestine. These autoimmune diseases can be treated with antibiotics; however diagnoses can be difficult and treatment can lead to side effects such as dysbacteriosis. An approach to diagnose conditions of IBD is wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE). WCE has become a valuable tool for the diagnosis of pathologies of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract [ 1 ]. These small pill-sized cameras allow the gastroenterologist the ability to diagnose pathologies in the small intestinal tract, which is the most difficult section of the alimentary canal to reach. The pill-sized cameras take pictures of the intestinal wall and relay them back to a recorder for evaluation at a later date.\nAn early example of a swallowable WCE is the M2A developed by Given Imaging Ltd. in 2000 [ 2 ]; it was renamed PillCam SB(R) in September 2004. The PillCam was specifically designed to overcome the problem of examining the small intestine. The capsule which is 11.0 mm in diameter and 25.0 mm long comprises a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera, four illuminating light emitting diodes (LEDs), a radio frequency (RF) module, and a power supply. WCE has now become the gold standard for examining the GI tract and there are a number of WCEs available commercially for this purpose; a detailed review of commercial WCE systems can be found in [ 3 , 4 ].\nWCE systems are generally restricted to diagnostic use as the availability of onboard space for surgical tools or medication limits the ability to treat pathologies such as ulcerative colitis [ 5 ]. This inability to deliver therapy to an area of interest in the GI tract leaves only the curative options of administering large quantities of drugs or surgical intervention.\nThe paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the state of the art in WCE systems, Section 3 presents the background to actuators employed to drive surgical tools, Section 4 presents a novel method for targeted drug delivery and a method to overcome natural peristalsis in the GI tract, Section 5 presents the design, analysis, and prototyping of a novel holding mechanism, Section 6 discusses the performance of a functioning prototype holding mechanism, and Section 7 concludes this work.\n2. State of the Art\nConventional WCE systems are passive medical devices which have been focused on imaging the GI tract; however for the next generation to be useful surgical tools they will require active mechanical parts to enable them to carry out tasks such as performing a biopsy or electrosurgery while resisting natural peristalsis.\n2.1. Resisting Peristalsis\nIn order to overcome the limitations of conventional WCE researchers have been exploring methods of increasing a capsule’s functionality such as methods of resisting natural peristalsis [ 6 – 8 ] or navigation through the GI tract [ 9 – 12 ]. The paddling based microrobot developed by Park et al. (2007) [ 13 ] was developed specifically for navigating the GI tract. This method of locomotion uses a leadscrew engaged with six radially positioned legs to propel a microrobot forwards. A method for anchoring to the intestinal wall which reduces the risk of injury to the intestinal tissue is proposed by Glass et al. (2008) [ 14 ]. They propose a three-legged anchoring mechanism which utilises micropatterned adhesives for resisting peristalsis. The anchoring mechanism consists of three axially aligned legs equally spaced around the capsule. Each leg is connected to a cylindrical pulley which is free to rotate. One end of a cable is secured to the capsule while the other end is secured to the upper end of the leg. The normal state of the cables is relaxed with the legs in the closed position. The leg pulleys are connected to the base of the capsule via rubber springs. When the anchoring mechanism is activated micromotors or shape memory alloy (SMA) wires pull the cables; this results in a torque being applied to the pulleys which rotate the legs opening them outwards. At the same time the rotation applies a torque to the rubber spring resulting in an opposing torque; this counter torque is the means of returning the legs to the closed position when the cable torque has been removed.\nAn alternative clamping system for clamping to the wall of the GI tract for the purpose of long-term pH monitoring has been proposed by Menciassi et al. (2005) [ 15 ]. The clamping system utilises three grasping units which extend forwards from the capsule and can be activated to clamp to the intestinal wall. The clamping mechanism is a combination of two subsystems, one system to operate the protrusion and return of the grasping unit and another system to operate the opening of the grasping unit. The clamper unit slides in a groove which runs parallel to the capsule’s body and is the vehicle which moves the grasping unit. The clamper unit is driven by thermally activating a 100 μm diameter SMA wire which is housed in a trench that runs alongside the groove. The wire has been coiled to generate the large forces required to slide the clamper unit forwards to bring it into contact with the intestinal wall. The grasping unit comprises two arms made from SMA. The arms are normally in a closed position which is achieved by virtue of a flexure joint which biases the arms. The arms are activated by heating a 20.0 mm long by 50 μm diameter SMA wire which has been fixed into holes in the arms. The heating causes the wire to contract which opens the arms.\nCurrent WCE devices lack the ability to control their speed and direction relying on natural peristalsis to move them through the GI tract. A solution that overcomes this problem is the robotic legged locomotion device developed by Valdastri et al. (2009) [ 16 ]. The 12-legged endoscopic capsular microrobot features two sets of six legs integrated into the capsule. These propel the device through the GI tract and help to uniformly distend collapsed colon tissue making visualisation easier. The legs are operated via their connection to a nut which moves axially up and down a leadscrew. The set of legs simultaneously open and close as the nut translates the leadscrew, with each set of legs being independently controlled by a motor and gearbox. The number of legs distributes the contact force over the colon wall reducing slippage.\nThe procedure of inspecting the lining of the oesophagus using a flexible endoscope is routine; however it is also a very uncomfortable procedure for the patient. Tognarelli et al. (2009) [ 17 ] propose SMA flat springs to halt the progress of an oesophageal WCE for the purpose of inspecting the oesophagus lining. The transit time through the oesophagus is rapid; therefore a stopping mechanism must have a quick response time. The 11.0 mm in diameter by 31.0 mm long capsule developed by Tognarelli et al. [ 17 ] can deploy a stopping mechanism suddenly to halt its progress through the oesophagus. The stopping mechanism consists of three equally spaced SMA flaps, a DC brushless motor, a pulley, a gear set, and three 0.15 mm diameter Kevlar wires. Rather than being triggered by the Joules effect the SMA legs have been set in an open position to take advantage of the superelastic properties of the material. The DC motor is connected to the gear set and pulley and is used to wind the legs into a cavity in the capsule body by virtue of the Kevlar wire which connects the tip of the legs to the pulley. When the wire is released the flaps return to their original open position and halt the progress of the capsule.\n2.2. Drug Delivery\nIncreasing a capsule’s functionality to include the means of delivering medication to a site of interest offers great advantages to patients. A commercial system developed by Phaeton Research attempts to deliver drugs to a specific location in the alimentary canal. The Enterion capsule [ 18 ] is administered with a standard volume of water (240 mL) [ 19 ] and relies on natural peristalsis to move it through the body. The device is manufactured from FDA approved plastics and has a capacity of storing 1 mL of medication in a drug reservoir in either a liquid, powder, or solid form. The medication is loaded by simply removing a bung at the rear of the capsule and filling up the drug reservoir. The medication is administered through the use of a compressed spring which when triggered operates a cylindrical piston. The piston expels the medication through the rear aperture at the same time as ejecting the bung. The spring is held in position by an anchoring mechanism which consists of a thin thread connected to the piston and to a heating element which is mounted on a circular printed circuit board. The anchoring mechanism works by heating the thin thread until it becomes weak and breaks releasing the spring and hence operating the piston. The heating element which is a resistor is triggered by an externally applied radiation. When the device passes through an electromagnetic field at the frequency an onboard receiver is tuned to, the induced current powers the resistor which heats the thin thread. The 1 mL of medication can be expelled at a target region in the GI tract such as the jejunum, ileum, ascending colon, or descending colon. It cannot target specific pathogens such as tumours or ulcers because it releases its payload as a bolus form. This has the effect of spreading the medication over a section of lumen as the capsule is under constant movement from peristalsis and has no means of stopping and holding its position.\nThe InteliSite is a drug delivery system manufactured by Innovative Devices LLC [ 20 ]. It opens ports on the side of the device releasing the drugs into the GI tract. It has a 1 mL reservoir capable of being loaded with either a liquid or a powder drug formulation. The drugs are administered when the capsule is exposed to a radio frequency magnetic field. The magnetic field causes two SMA wires to heat up and straighten out. This action causes an inner sleeve which has a series of slots in it to rotate aligning it with a series of slots in the outer surface. This action allows the drugs to be released into the GI tract. The device has no means to propel the drug from the capsule into the GI tract; instead it relies on the natural turbulence generated from the capsule passing through the GI tract to disperse the medication.\nPhilips Research has developed IntelliCap [ 21 ], an intelligent pill for electronically controlled drug delivery in the GI tract. This device uses a micropump to propel the medication into the GI tract. The IntelliCap incorporates a microprocessor, battery, pH sensor, temperature sensor, RF wireless transceiver, fluid pump, and drug reservoir. A microprocessor controls the delivery of the drug through the internal fluid pump which can disperse the medication in different delivery profiles such as burst, progressive release, or a multilocation dosing.\nThe telemetric capsule developed by Lambert et al. (1991) [ 22 ] has an interchangeable tip used for either aspirating or releasing a liquid into the GI tract. The tip is controlled by a magnetic switch which is activated by a permanent magnet being brought into close proximity to the capsule (closer than 15 cm). The switch triggers a microfurnace to heat up a strip of plastic which breaks after two seconds causing a clip to open; this releases a compressed spring which starts the delivery. The plastic strip is destroyed each time the capsule is deployed and needs replacing. The drug delivery tip utilises an inflatable elastic reservoir to store 1 mL of medication. A port on the side of the capsule allows for easy filling of the reservoir using a syringe; a tight Silastic joint prevents the medication from escaping. When the mechanism is activated the piston moves forward opening the way for the medication to flow through, propelled from the contraction of the expanded reservoir, and delivering the medication into the GI tract.\nKarargyris and Koulaouzidis (2013) [ 23 ] propose a diagnostic capsule which provides positional information while navigating the GI tract. The system, which is based on previous work carried out by Bourbakis et al. (2010) [ 24 ], utilises two positional sensor wheels as opposed to the one wheel approach proposed by Lambert et al. (1991) [ 22 ]. The capsule’s two sensor wheels are mounted on soft spiral springs. The springs extend the wheels from the capsule’s body so that they make contact with the GI tract wall. Frictional forces between the intestinal wall and the wheels cause the wheels to rotate. The rotating wheels emit electromagnetic peaks which are received by precision sensors on the control board of the capsule allowing the progress of the capsule to be monitored.\n2.3. Microbiopsy Actuators\nIt is challenging to diagnose pathologies of the small intestinal mucosa; however performing a biopsy can diagnose pathologies early such as in the diagnosis of small intestinal Crohn’s disease [ 25 ]. To this end, researchers have been extending the capabilities of WCE to include actuators for the purpose of obtaining a tissue sample from the intestinal tract.\nPark et al. (2008) [ 26 ] have developed an actuator for small intestinal biopsy which can be integrated into a conventional WCE. The microactuator has been manufactured through a LiGA process. The dimensions are 10.0 mm in diameter by 1.8 mm thickness. The actuator comprises three main component parts: a microspike for taking the biopsy, a torsion spring actuator, and an SMA heating wire triggering mechanism. The microspike is propelled forwards and backwards through the operation of a slider-crank mechanism. The slider crank comprises a connecting rod which is attached to a torsion spring at one end and the microspike at the other. A polymer string holds the torsion spring in position by anchoring it to a series of small fixing posts. This fixing method allows the polymer string to be routed across the PCB mounting board and across an SMA heating wire. When a current is applied to the SMA wire it heats up and melts the polymer string and hence releases the torsion spring which in turn propels the microspike forwards and then backwards to the stored position.\nKong et al. (2005) [ 27 ] have developed a rotational microbiopsy module which has been integrated into a WCE specifically to perform a biopsy of the small intestines. It is a compact design with a diameter of 10.0 mm and a thickness of 2.0 mm. The thickness is approximately 10% thicker than the design proposed by Park et al. (2008) [ 26 ]. The module utilises an eccentrically mounted razorblade configuration to remove a section of the GI wall. The release of a torsion spring causes the tissue-cutting razorblade to protrude from the side wall of the capsule. The blade rotates 120 degrees at a force of 10 N removing a sample of the wall as it rotates. The continued rotation of the blade causes the sample to be sealed into the WCE. The razorblade trigger mechanism is a paraffin block which restrains the blade against the torque from the torsion spring. The blade is released when the WCE receives a trigger signal causing the paraffin block to melt at 42°C. The low melting temperature ensures the intestines remain undamaged. The power requirement to operate the trigger was measured at 300 mA for 1.7 seconds and it is intended that it will be supplied by an onboard battery.\nA self-propelling endoscopic system with a miniature manipulator mounted at the front is proposed by Peirs et al. (2000) [ 28 ] for retrieving a biopsy sample from the intestinal wall. The device uses two clamping modules which utilise a series of perforations to hold the intestinal wall through an applied vacuum. The modules are connected by an expansion/contraction bellow which allows the clamping modules to move independently. A hydraulically controlled Stewart platform with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF) has been utilised to position the micro tools. The hydraulic power required to drive the actuators will be supplied by an umbilical cord.\n2.4. SMA Based Actuators\nSMAs are increasingly being used by researchers as actuators to increase the functionality of WCEs as they can take advantage of their superelastic properties which allow large amounts of deformation to take place without permanently damaging the material.\nGorini et al. (2006) [ 29 ] propose the use of SMA wires to operate an actuator for a six-legged endoscopic capsule. The proposed miniaturised leg mechanism is to be integrated into a WCE for the purpose of locomotion in the GI tract. The mechanism comprises three main components: a PEEK prismatic support with dimensions of 3.4 mm × 25.0 mm × 3.2 mm, the leg, and the SMA wire system. The operation of the leg is through the activation of two 100 μm diameter SMA wires connected to a brass micropulley. The right-hand wire is wrapped clockwise around the pulley and the left-hand wire is wrapped anticlockwise around the pulley, with the ends of the wires fixed to the prismatic support. Applying a current of 360 mA and 10 V for a period of 4 s to the left-hand wire causes the wire to contract by 6% and rotate the pulley approximately 135 degrees. After a period of cooling the right-hand wire is activated bringing the leg back inside the prismatic support. The degree of leg rotation is dictated by the length of contraction of the 100.0 mm long SMA wire; however the geometry of the prismatic support limits the length of wire which can be used. This issue has been overcome by the addition of glass shafts mounted in the prismatic support which allow the wire to be wrapped around them without shortcutting the circuit. The SMA wire is 40.0 mm longer than required to fully open the leg as compensation for the resistance from the antagonist SMA wire during the rotation of the pulley is required.\nA two-way linear actuator mechanism driven by SMA springs is proposed by Kim et al. (2005) [ 30 ] for the purpose of locomotion in capsule-type endoscopes. The 33.0 mm long by 13.0 mm diameter capsule is intended to navigate the GI tract by means of four sliding clamps which have been arranged around the outside surface of the capsule body. The four sliding clamps carry microhooks which protrude from the capsule by 400–600 μm. The purpose of the clamps and hooks is to replicate the motion of insects such as the earthworm by mimicking its setae. The 180 μm diameter angled hooks are similar to those reported previously by Lee et al. (2004) [ 31 ]. The capsule moves forwards through a sequence of independent clamp movements which are driven by four two-way linear actuators. The two-way linear actuators comprise two SMA springs which are connected to either side of the clamp and are activated independently through the Joules effect. When the forward spring is contracted for a period of 2 s it pulls the clamp forwards at which point the clamp grips the surface of the GI tract. The forward spring is allowed to cool for a period of 5 s before the rear spring is contracted. The contraction of the rear spring pulls the capsule forwards with a maximum stroke length of 7.5 mm. This sequence is repeated with each sliding clamp being activated in turn to propel the capsule through the GI tract at a rate of 110 mm/min. The SMA springs reach a maximum operating temperature of 70°C with an applied current of 400 mA and a voltage of less than 2 V.\nTable 1 is a comparison of the capsules discussed and their actuator method. The positions marked with a “—” signify that the feature is unavailable or that details relating to the module’s function have not been published in the literature. As can be seen from Table 1 the WCEs have many different modules; however all possible modules are not contained in any one capsule.\nTable 1: Comparison of WCE systems with increased functionality for the purpose of delivering therapy to the GI tract.\n3. Background\nTo perform a surgical task a degree of mechanical movement is required of the tools. For example, a needle must move forwards to pierce tissue or the jaw of a clamp must close to obtain a sample [ 32 ]. The kinematics of the tools performing the curative treatment can be achieved through the application of actuators. There are a number of actuators available such as SMA actuators, piezoelectric actuators, and micromotors. Choosing the correct actuator for a given task such as holding a WCE against natural peristalsis requires the consideration of a number of factors such as the available space, the type of movement, and the peak power consumption.\n3.1. Piezoelectric Squiggle Motor\nAn actuator solution for controlling a holding mechanism could be the use of a piezoelectric linear motor to drive the mechanism directly. These motors use the piezoelectric effect to drive the actuation. The piezoelectric effect is the change in a material’s geometry due to an applied electric charge or a mechanical stress changing a solid’s shape which will result in a proportional electrical charge [ 33 ]. There are a number of issues with piezoelectric actuators such that they require displacement amplification mechanisms to obtain a useful stroke length and that they also require large voltages (100 V) to activate them [ 28 ].\nNonconductive materials such as quartz (SiO2) exhibit the piezoelectric effect and can be utilised in such applications as displacement transducers. The Squiggle piezoelectric linear motor manufactured by New Scale Technologies [ 34 ] utilises the piezoelectric effect to vibrate a leadscrew causing it to travel forwards and backwards (Figure 1 ).\nFigure 1: Piezoelectric Squiggle motor.\nThe Squiggle motor (SQL-RV-1.8-6-12) is one of the smallest piezoelectric motors in the world with a package size 6.0 mm long by 2.8 mm square and a leadscrew 12.0 mm long. The motor has a high positioning resolution of 0.5 μm and a stall force (4.5 V input) of 0.5 N which makes it a good candidate for operating a holding mechanism.\nAn alternative to the piezoelectric Squiggle motor is a micromotor. Micromotors could potentially be used to drive the holding mechanisms directly. An examination of the latest available technology in micromotors shows that there are a limited number of micromotors on the market which could fit within the package size of the capsule and have a useful torque capability at a low RPM.\n3.2. Micromotors\nA micromotor which appears to have the required specifications is the\n1.5 mm × 12.5 mm long geared micromotor manufactured by Namiki (number 10-010) [ 35 ] (Figure 2 ).\nFigure 2: Namiki four-stage geared micromotor.\nThe four-stage geared micromotor operates at 60 mW and runs at 76 RPM; this produces a stall torque of 1.6 mNm. The Namiki motor can be compared with the specifications of three alternative motors: a\n6.0 mm × 3.75 mm long motor manufactured by Maxon Motor (EC 6) [ 36 ], a\n1.9 mm × 10.82 mm long micromotor manufactured by Faulhaber (02/1) [ 37 ], and the Squiggle motor. An important criterion is the micromotor’s maximum power output. A comparison of the four motors using a merit index to compare the power output against the motor’s volume (Table 2 ) shows that the Squiggle motor is far superior to the other motors as the higher the merit index is the more powerful the motor is for its size. However the Squiggle motor operates in a linear orientation compared to the rotational output of the micromotors.\nTable 2: Power to volume merit index.\nThe Namiki micromotor can be evaluated for its ability to perform the task of moving a 0.5 g mass of stainless steel. The stainless steel would replicate the mass of the holding mechanism and represent 10% of the total weight of the microrobot.\nThe torque required to move the mass of stainless steel can be calculated using the following equation:\nwhere\nis the angular acceleration and can be calculated at 265.3 rads/s2 from the motor’s performance data and\nis the moment of inertia which can be expressed as\n, where\nis the mass concentrated at a radius, the Radius of Gyration (\n), which would be 5.0 mm. This concentrated mass would be a worst case scenario as it assumes the total volume to be moved is positioned at the extreme limit of the microrobot.\nThe results of the initial torque evaluation show that a torque of 3.32 μNm would be required to operate the holding mechanism. Clearly the 1.6 mNm capacity of the Namiki micromotor would be sufficient to drive the mechanism; however consideration of losses due to the inherent system’s friction would also be required.\n3.3. SMA Actuators\nSMAs can be used as an alternative to micromotors. The most commonly used SMA is superelastic nitinol which is an alloy of approximately 50% nickel and 50% titanium. Nitinol has superelastic properties which allow large amounts of deformation to take place without permanently damaging the lattice structure of the material. This allowable strain makes it possible to create super springs which can be triggered by the Joules effect. The disadvantages of using SMAs are that they require high power consumption and that they can affect their environment as a result of heating. Also they are unable to fully recover their original configuration after cooling due to twinning of the atomic crystal [ 38 ]. This can be overcome by detwinning the lattice through the use of a secondary process which would apply a bias to the spring.\nSMA wire could be employed to drive a holding mechanism. The wire could be orientated in a pulley configuration minimising volume and attaining a mechanical advantage from the pulley. The approximate relationship between the pulley’s radius (\n) and the length (\n) of wire required to rotate the pulley through an angle (\n) has been determined by Gorini et al. (2006) [ 29 ] and is given by\nThe 0.04 represents a 4% contraction of the wire due to the Joules effect. Applying the formula to a pulley with a radius (\n) of 0.9 mm and a required rotation (\n) of 90 degrees results in a theoretical length (\n) of the wire being 35.3 mm. The actuator mechanism would require a longer wire to operate efficiently as the theoretical model does not take into account the friction in the system and the drop in performance of the wire due to multiple operations. Also the wire would need to overcome the resistance imposed by a second wire which would be required to return the pulley to its original configuration. A consideration of the difficulty in manufacturing and assembling such small and complex components would need to be taken into account when designing such a mechanism.\n3.4. Actuator Characteristics Comparison\nThe various actuator mechanisms described offer a diverse range of potential solutions to control a holding mechanism, with each actuator system having a number of advantages and disadvantages. To present a clear overview and to help understand the various options an evaluation matrix has been created using a set of criteria relating to the actuators’ characteristics (Table 3 ). The matrix gives a quantitative assessment of the performance of each method.\nTable 3: Actuator characteristics evaluation matrix.\nThe evaluation matrix highlights the problems associated with completing a task such as controlling the opening position of a holding mechanism within the GI tract. The linear movement of piezoelectric actuators and SMA actuators makes controlling the deployment speed very difficult, whereas micromotors would have little difficulty with this task. However the position of the holding mechanism would need to be determined. It is envisioned that this problem could be overcome for micromotors by using a specifically designed encoder system or using the rise in current consumption as a system trigger.\n4. Methods\nThere is a clinical need to target and treat pathologies of the GI tract such as ulcerative colitis, polyps, and Crohn’s disease [ 39 ]. These pathologies are currently being treated by using conventional endoscopes in the upper and lower regions of the GI tract but the middle section, the jejunum, and ileum are only reachable through viewing a series of pictures from a WCE. Passive WCEs do not meet the clinical need to directly treat these pathologies of the small intestines. In order to examine or treat a specific location or feature within the GI tract a WCE would be required to stop. However it would still require small overall geometry to enable the capsule to pass through the junctions of the GI tract without becoming an obstruction.\n4.1. Microrobot Concept\nFigure 3 represents a microrobot concept design capable of resisting peristaltic pressure through the deployment of an integrated holding mechanism and delivering a 1 mL dose of medication to a targeted site through the positioning of a needle. The needle has the ability to be positioned in a 360-degree envelope while simultaneously maintaining a diametrically opposite relationship with the holding mechanism; this novel feature guarantees needle penetration of the GI tract wall. Figure 4 shows a section view through the component parts of the needle positioning mechanism.\nFigure 3: Concept microrobot capable of resisting peristaltic pressure through an integrated holding mechanism and delivering 1 mL of medication to a target site.\nFigure 4: Needle positioning mechanism assembly with material removed for clarity. Needle shown in the fully retracted position.\nDelivering a metered dose of medication to a site of interest is achieved through a novel mechanism utilising a cam, a needle funnel, two opposing ratchets, a needle, and a single micromotor manufactured by Namiki (Figure 4 ). The dimensions of the micromotor are\n1.5 mm × 10.5 mm long. Orientating the micromotor along the central axis of the microrobot allows for simple coupling to the cam and needle funnel via two opposing ratchets. Driving the micromotor anticlockwise allows for the angular positioning of the needle, which has been fixed at one of 16 positions equally spaced. Driving the micromotor clockwise extends and retracts the needle. The novel positioning mechanism functions through the use of a series of ratchets engaging and disengaging to allow the various operations to be performed. A detailed evaluation of the targeting mechanism can be found in [ 40 ].\n4.2. Microrobot Technical Specification\nConventional WCEs have a volume of 2.0 cm3; however the increased functionality requires a greater volume to house the mechanisms; therefore a volume of 3.0 cm3 has been chosen for the microrobot. Studies carried out by Connor et al. (2009) [ 41 ] have shown that capsules of dimensions\n11.0 mm × 32.0 mm long are capable of being swallowed by subjects aged 18 to 65 years. Therefore the increased volume will have little impact on the majority of patients being able to swallow the microrobot or on its ability to navigate the junctions of the small intestine such as the ileocolic valve. The detailed specifications for the microrobot’s performance are outlined in Table 4 .\nTable 4: Microrobot performance specification.\nIn order to realise a WCE with added functionality such as the ability to resist natural peristalsis or targeted drug delivery it is important to consider how these mechanisms can be operated.\nA single micromotor manufactured by Faulhaber (02/1) (Table 2 ) has been selected to drive the holding mechanism (Figure 5(a) ). The micromotor’s small package size\n1.9 mm × 10.82 mm long allows the motor to be orientated perpendicular to the microrobot. The micromotor’s novel configuration coupled with the bevel gear set allows rotation to be translated through 90 degrees and also a reduction in the micromotor’s RPM while maximising the use of space (Figure 5(b) ). The reduction in RPM will result in a multiplication of the micromotor’s torque; this will give the legs the strength required to distend the GI tract wall and hold the microrobot in place [ 42 ].\nFigure 5: Fully extended holding mechanism and micromotor driving a bevel gear set (a); holding mechanism shown in the fully retracted position (b).\nDistending the GI tract wall in order to resist peristaltic contractions will result in forces being applied to the surface of the wall through the interaction of the legs with the wall. This interaction results in the possibility of the GI tract suffering from postoperative ileus. As a result of the GI tract being contacted the wall can cease to function. However postoperative ileus is usually associated with metabolic abnormalities or with the GI tract being handled such as in laparotomies or abdominal surgery and is not associated with endoscopy or with the use of WCE. The thin leg sections may also pose a potential risk of damaging the GI tract wall if external forces become too high. However a larger surface area could easily be integrated into the distal profile of the holding mechanism’s legs to eliminate any potential trauma from operating the mechanism.\nThe bevel gear set comprises a 13-toothed drive gear, connected to the micromotor, and a 48-toothed follower gear (Figure 6(a) ). The stability of the follower gear is derived from the casing of the microrobot and a cover which holds the micromotor and bevel gear in position. The 48-toothed bevel gear drives an 8-toothed spur gear (Figure 6(b) ). The 8-toothed spur gear drives a gear train which runs inside a recess in the 48-toothed bevel gear. The last pair of 22-toothed gears drive the holding mechanism in and out via a connection between the gears and two legs.\nFigure 6: Fully extended holding mechanism: (a) 0.2 module 13-tooth and 48-tooth bevel gear set, (b) the 48-tooth bevel gear drives the central 0.1 module 8-toothed spur gear with the gear train running in a recess set in the bevel gear.\n4.3. Gear Train Parameters\nThe gear train reduces the 1,538 RPM output from the micromotor to 8.4 RPM; this allows the holding mechanism to be fully deployed in approximately 1.8 s. Based on an average transit time through the small intestines of 23 mm/min [ 19 ] the capsule would have travelled approximately 0.7 mm before the holding mechanism is fully deployed. The response time of the holding mechanism can be adjusted by reducing or increasing the number of teeth on the driver or follower gears.\nThe overall geometry of the microrobot and the gear module, which is the ratio of the pitch diameter to the number of teeth on the gear, has a direct influence on the dimensions of the gears. For example, the 48-toothed bevel gear has a module of 0.2; this results in an overall diameter of 10.0 mm which represents the maximum diameter that could fit within the microrobot. A module of 0.1 has been selected for the gear train as this facilitates maximum speed reduction yet minimises the use of space. The design parameters for the complete gear train are specified in Table 5 .\nTable 5: Bevel gear and spur gear design parameters.\n5. Results\nThe 0.1 module chosen for the gear train results in a micrometre gear tooth profile (Figure 7 ). It is therefore important to determine if the teeth can withstand the bending loads which they will be subjected to when the micromotor is operated at its maximum RPM. The Faulhaber (02/1) micromotor has been selected for the purpose of the gear train analysis. It has a two-stage 13 : 1 reduction gearbox which results in an output of 1,543 RPM and a torque of 0.15 mNm. The following sections analyse the loads which the teeth would be subjected to when the mechanism performs a full cycle.\nFigure 7: Gear tooth loading modelled as a cantilever beam.\n5.1. Gear Tooth Loading\nFor the purposes of analysis the tooth can be modelled as a cantilever beam with an involute gear tooth profile. Figure 7 shows the forces acting at the pitch circle of the involute tooth profile and some additional relationships between features.\nThe contact angle between mating teeth is known as the pressure angle (\n) and in this application it is set at an industry standard of 20 degrees for a spur gear.\n5.2. Bending Stress Calculations\nThe stress figures determined by analysis are an important resource as they can be used to determine the material the gears are to be manufactured from and the manufacturing process.\nThe bending stress for a spur gear tooth or a straight toothed bevel gear can be obtained by using the Lewis formula which has been modified to take into consideration the contact impact of the gears through the addition of a velocity factor:\nwhere\nis the load applied to the tooth,\nis the velocity factor,\nis the normal module, and\nis the Lewis form factor.\nThe assumptions made with the modified Lewis formula are that the full load is applied to a single tooth and the radial component force (\n) is ignored and also that the force is distributed evenly over the full face width of the tooth and that the stress concentration effect of the tooth fillet is also ignored.\nTo calculate the load (\n) acting at the circular pitch\nwhere\nis the torque on the drive gear and\nis the reference diameter of pinion and can be calculated by the number of teeth on the pinion (\n) multiplied by the normal module (\n).\nThe velocity factor\ncompensates for the dynamic effect of the gears pitch line velocity and the manufacturing method used to produce the teeth profile. For a hobbed or shaped gear Barth’s formula can be used to calculate the velocity factor:\nwhere\nis the pitch line velocity and is calculated by\nwhere\nis the pitch diameter and\nis the rotating speed of the gear in revolutions per minute.\nThe Lewis form factor (\n) is a function of tooth shape and is independent of tooth size; it also does not take into consideration the stress raiser effect of the tooth fillet. It can be calculated as follows:\nwhere\nis the number of teeth on the gear.\nThe normal module (\n) of a gear is the ratio of the pitch diameter to the number of teeth on the gear. The module has a direct relation to the geometry of the teeth and the overall diameter (\n); it can be calculated as follows:\nAn example of the module’s impact on the outside diameter can be shown using a module of 0.5 and 22 teeth as this would result in an outside gear diameter of 12.0 mm. If the same number of teeth was to be used with a 0.1 module the outside diameter would become 2.4 mm. Therefore the smaller the module the smaller the gear geometry which can be generated.\n5.3. Tooth Bending Stress\nApplying the modified Lewis formula ( 3 ) to the bevel gear set, which has a module of 0.2, results in a tooth bending stress of 3.57 Nmm−2 for the 13-toothed gear and 2.30 Nmm−2 for the 48-toothed gear. The calculated low figures for stress can be used to guide the design of the gears as the results suggest the gear set could be manufactured from a polymer such as PEEK. The benefit of making the 48-toothed gear from a polymer would be a simplified assembly as friction bushes can be eliminated by designing the gear to have bearing surfaces and reduced weight. However applying the formula to the next gear in the train results in significantly higher levels of bending stress.\nApplying the Lewis formula to the 8-toothed drive gear, which has a module of 0.1 and is connected to the 48-toothed bevel gear, yields a stress of 176.21 Nmm−2. At this level of stress it would result in a polymer tooth yielding; therefore a metallic gear would be required. The Lewis formula does not take into account the stress raising effect of the fillets or the stress distribution when the radial component load (\n) is applied; therefore an FEA analysis has been performed to determine a more accurate level of stress distribution through the tooth (Figure 8 ).\nFigure 8: Von Mises FEA 2D isoareas analysis of a 0.1 module gear tooth profile with a radial component load of 1.473 N.\nFigure 8 shows a Von Mises FEA 2D isoareas analysis of a 0.1 module gear tooth profile with an applied radial component load of 1.473 N. The radial load\nhas been calculated from the applied load\nand the pressure angle\n. There is a distinct difference in the result for loading: Figure 8 (A) shows the compressive stress to be 139.42 Nmm−2 while Figure 8 (B) shows the tensile stress to be 121.69 Nmm−2. Although the FEA figures are lower than the calculated figure (176.21 Nmm−2) the FEA figures confirm that the 8 toothed gear must be manufactured from a metal rather than a polymer to ensure the teeth do not yield under load.\nThe Von Mises FEA analysis assumes a worst case scenario; that is, at any one time only one pair of teeth are in contact with each other and they take the total load. Generally two pairs of teeth are in contact; however this may drop to 1.5 depending on the degree of tooth truncation and inaccuracies in tooth profile due to the manufacturing process. Increasing the value of the face width or increasing the module would reduce the stress in the tooth; however increasing the module would result in an increase in the overall diameter of each gear in the set and hence the overall size of the gear train would increase. Also increasing the tooth thickness will influence the overall length of the microrobot due to the stack-up of dimensions. However increasing the size of the components would make manufacturing generally easier.\n5.4. Gear Manufacture\nThere are a number of process routes which can be used to produce the holding mechanism’s gear train; for example, hobbing, rapid prototyping, and wire EDM are all methods which could be employed to produce the spur gear set which drives the legs in and out. However, feature geometry, material selection, and manufacturing cost dictated that CNC milling was chosen. Figure 9 shows a 5 : 1 scaled model of the complete gear train assembled in the gear box housing.\nFigure 9: 5 : 1 scale prototype of the holding mechanism’s gear train.\nPrototyping the gears using a CNC milling machine allowed the use of small diameter end mills (\n0.5 mm) to generate the tooth profiles and to achieve the tight root radii of the teeth. However the use of Nylon 6, which was selected for its mechanical properties, resulted in the gears having significant burrs owing to the manufacturing process. The burs can clearly be seen on the 8-tooth spur gear (Figure 10 ).\nFigure 10: CNC milled 8-tooth spur gear manufactured from Nylon 6. The profile of the teeth is obscured by significant burring.\nThere are a number of manufacturing issues which can leave the gears with excessive burrs; for example, the end mill feed rate may be too fast or the wrong style of cutter may be selected. Cutter selection is very important as different materials have different requirements. Cutting plastic requires a sharp edged tool; therefore a hollow ground edged tool is preferable over a radially ground tool as it will be sharper and result in a cleaner edge.\n5.5. Gear Measurements\nRemoving the burrs from all the gears in the gear train with a very sharp blade, such as a razor blade, allowed for inspection of the gears to confirm dimensional accuracy. Inspection of the 8-tooth spur gears was performed on a profile projector type PJ-300 manufactured by Mitutoyo at 10x magnification and a Mitutoyo 0–25 mm digital micrometer. The measured results have been collated in Table 6 .\nTable 6: Statistical measured data for the 8-tooth spur gears.\nComparing the measured dimensions with the design values shows that the average gear tooth thickness is greater than the nominal value and that the average tooth depth is shallower than nominal. The measured dimensions are well within the expected manufacturing tolerance limit for the given part; however the tendency for the teeth to be slightly bigger than required may pose problems with the gears meshing and running smoothly in the assembly.\n5.6. Gear Train Performance\nAs can be seen from Figure 10 there are significant burrs on the top and bottom of the teeth profiles; these burrs are also evident on the larger gears in the train although not to such an extent. The burrs can influence the performance of the gear train in a number of ways; they can directly change the gear profile by being trapped between the rotating teeth and, in addition, the excess material will reduce the clearance between the gears; these two faults may result in a greater bending load being imposed on the tooth. The reduced clearance will also increase the friction within the system which places a greater load on the micromotor driving the train. Therefore it is important to remove the burrs from all the gears before operating the gear train. To overcome the issue of significant burring an alternative material such as stainless steel 316 could be used as a direct replacement for the gears.\nThe average thickness of the teeth (0.798 mm) suggests that the gear train would not run smoothly due to the reduced clearance; however on the larger gears the average thickness of the teeth was undersized (0.71 mm). This compensated for the thicker teeth and, once the burrs had been removed, resulted in a smooth running gear train. The slightly larger sized teeth on the smaller gears are an advantage in this instance as they can withstand a greater bending stress during operation.\n5.7. Prototype Holding Mechanism\nThe prototype holding mechanism comprises the micromotor, gear train (bevel gears and spur gears), and two legs connected to the gear train which drive the tie bars and centre support in and out (Figure 6 ). The legs, tie bars, and centre support are pinned together to allow them to pivot freely. Figure 11 shows a section view of the fully assembled holding mechanism with some components removed for clarity and Figure 12 shows the complete microrobot with the holding mechanism fully expanded.\nFigure 11: 5 : 1 scale holding mechanism fully collapsed.\nFigure 12: 5 : 1 scale holding mechanism fully expanded.\nFigure 12 shows a prototype of the holding mechanism which can be manually operated through the rotation of a driveshaft connected directly to the gear train and which protrudes through the side of the gearbox; it also has a simplified spur gear train. The purpose of the simplified spur gear train was to enable manual functionality testing of the gears and the holding mechanism’s legs and as such the number of turns required to operate the holding mechanism was kept to a minimum. However the gear train uses all the gears specified in the concept design (Figure 6 and Table 5 ).\n6. Discussion\nDelivering medication to a target site of interest in the GI tract requires an ability to overcome peristalsis. A prototype microrobot with an integrated holding mechanism has been presented which achieves this goal through the deployment of an expandable set of legs that are driven by a micromotor and a novel gearbox configuration. The holding mechanism has been designed for ease of manufacture and also for ease of assembly. However there were a number of issues with individual component parts and with the assembly of the parts which required addressing before a working prototype could be realised. For example, the material and manufacturing process chosen to prototype the gears resulted in gears with significant burrs which required removal before the gear train could be operated. Changing the gear material to a stainless steel would overcome this issue and also open up alternative manufacturing methods such as hobbing or wire EDM.\nManually operating the gearbox resulted in a smooth, free-running mechanism that took three and a half turns to fully expand the holding mechanism and three and a half turns to collapse it. However the calculated number of turns required to operate the mechanism is 2.6 turns. The difference in these two figures can be attributed to the backlash in the gear train which predominantly comprises the clearance between the gears, required for free running, and also the clearance between the gears’ driveshaft and the housing. Reducing the backlash in future prototypes can be achieved through closer control of the manufacturing method chosen to produce the parts; for example, CNC milling and CNC turning could be used to produce the gears and gearbox. By applying tighter control over the dimensioning of the features the backlash in the gear train could be reduced. However the reduction in backlash would result in an increase in the manufacturing cost of the parts.\nProducing prototypes which meet intended requirements will generally involve a compromise between part accuracy, surface finish, size, and cost. The selected manufacturing method will satisfy the majority of requirements; however the designer will ultimately decide which parameters are the most important and therefore which can be compromised.\n7. Conclusion\nIn this paper we have presented the first holding mechanism of its kind for the purpose of resisting natural peristalsis in the GI tract. Exploitation of microactuators and conventional manufacturing techniques resulted in a holding mechanism which has been integrated into a WCE, occupying just 9% of the total available volume. The outcome of prototyping spur gears manufactured from Nylon 6 has highlighted the limitations with conventional CNC milling and material selection. This shows how adapting manufacturing methods to meet intended requirements can allow for radical changes in the capabilities of WCE systems in the future.\nConflict of Interests\nhttp://www.research.philips.com/ .\nA.

In particular, the unique subsurface drill will address some of these, such as the possible existence and stability of subsurface organics. PanCam will establish the surface geological and morphological context for the mission, working in collaboration with other context instruments. Here, we describe the PanCam scientific objectives in geology, atmospheric science, and 3-D vision. We discuss the design of PanCam, which includes a stereo pair of Wide Angle Cameras (WACs), each of which has an 11-position filter wheel and a High Resolution Camera (HRC) for high-resolution investigations of rock texture at a distance. The cameras and electronics are housed in an optical bench that provides the mechanical interface to the rover mast and a planetary protection barrier. The electronic interface is via the PanCam Interface Unit (PIU), and power conditioning is via a DC-DC converter. PanCam also includes a calibration target mounted on the rover deck for radiometric calibration, fiducial markers for geometric calibration, and a rover inspection mirror. Key Words: Mars—ExoMars—Instrumentation—Geology—Atmosphere—Exobiology—Context. Astrobiology 17, 511–541.\n1. Introduction\nPanCam is one of the context instruments on the ExoMars rover (Vago et al., 2017 , in this issue) and will provide images in the visible and near infrared (NIR), from which crucial observations of landscape morphology, geology, and atmospheric science may be derived. PanCam will be the prime tool to characterize the morphology and geology of rock outcrops on the martian surface and will be crucial during mission operations for geological target selection and characterization. PanCam data will support the overarching exobiological objective of ExoMars through the characterization of paleoenvironments that involved sustained liquid water at the ExoMars study site. The PanCam spectral range is extended by the Infrared Spectrometer for ExoMars (ISEM) instrument (Korablev et al., 2017 , in this issue), which will add to the mineralogical determination; as shown by Harris et al. ( 2015 ), definitive identification of unique minerals is rarely achievable with the PanCam wavelength range alone. In addition, the Close-UP Imager (CLUPI; Josset et al., 2017 , in this issue) will provide high-resolution images of potential drilling sites and other interesting samples. Subsurface context will be provided by a ground-penetrating radar (Water Ice and Subsurface Deposit Observation On Mars, WISDOM; Ciarletti et al., 2017 , in this issue) and a neutron detector (Autonomous Detector of Radiation Of Neutrons, ADRON; Mitrofanov et al. 2017 , in this issue), as well as a visible-IR spectrometer (Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsurface Studies, Ma_MISS; De Sanctis et al., 2017 , in this issue) in the drill tip to provide in situ mineralogy for the subsurface samples before they are brought to the surface. Sample analysis will be by the Analytical Laboratory Drawer (ALD) instruments, MicrOmega (Bibring et al., 2017 , in this issue), RLS (Raman spectrometer; Rull et al., 2017 , in this issue), and Mars Organic Molecule Analyser (MOMA; Goesmann et al., 2017 , in this issue).\nPanCam will be fundamental in the day-to-day scientific operations of the rover. The images and other data products will be available to the team soon after downlink to assist with scientific decisions on where to drive next, on what targets of interest geological observations should focus on, and where and which rock units ExoMars should drill. The team intends to make images available via ESA in near real time for outreach purposes as appropriate. The central role of PanCam in these activities has been shown to be vital in many field trials already (e.g., Schmitz et al., 2009 ; Steele et al., 2010 ; Gunes-Lasnet et al., 2014 ).\nIn this paper, after presenting the team organization, we discuss the PanCam scientific objectives and instrument design, and the measurement scenario, calibration, and 3-D vision aspects.\n1.1. Team organization\nThe PanCam team organization is illustrated in Fig. 1 . Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL) is the principal investigator (PI) institute with overall responsibility for the instrument, supported by co-PI involvements for major hardware contributions at DLR, Germany (supported by industry, OHB), and Space-X, Switzerland (supported by industry, RUAG). In addition, there are lead-co-I roles in Austria (Joanneum Research—3-D vision team lead) and Wales (Aberystwyth University—Small Items lead). The hardware team is led by a project manager. The international science team is co-chaired by the PI and co-PIs.\nIn addition to the science team, which has association with each of the key components, co-I “swaps” have been initiated with the ISEM, WISDOM, and CLUPI teams, emphasizing and enhancing the collaborative nature of the mission.\n2. Scientific Objectives\n2.1. Contribution to overall rover mission science\nThe overall goals of the ExoMars 2020 rover (Vago et al., 2017 , in this issue) are to search for signs of past and present life on Mars and to characterize the water/geochemical environment as a function of depth in the shallow subsurface. The key new aspect of the mission is the retrieval and analysis of subsurface samples from 0 to 2 m below the oxidized surface of Mars. Rover operations include an integrated set of measurements at multiple scales: beginning with panoramic imaging and analysis of the geological context, progressing to finer-scale investigations of surface rock outcrops, and culminating with the collection of well-selected subsurface (or surface) samples to be studied in the rover's analytical laboratory.\nThe main scientific objectives of PanCam may be summarized as follows:\n(1) Provide 2-D and 3-D geological and mineralogical context information through imaging, including construction of digital terrain models (DTMs) and their visualization;\n(2) Support the selection of rover science and drilling sites by providing geological and mineralogical characterization of target rock outcrops;\n(3) Geologically investigate and map the rover science traverse and drilling sites;\n(4) Locate the landing site, the science sites, and the rover position with respect to local and global references by comparison and data fusion with data from orbiters;\n(5) Support rover traverse planning with geological context of the environment;\n(6) Image and characterize the acquired drill samples;\n(7) Study the properties of the atmosphere and variable phenomena, including water and dust content of the atmosphere.\nPanCam will determine the geological and geomorphological context for the remainder of the rover payload. A pair of Wide Angle Cameras (WACs) and a close-up High Resolution Camera (HRC) located at the top of the mast of the rover, together with geological, atmospheric, and red/green/blue filters, constitute a powerful camera system for planetary science. The WACs and HRC enable complementary imaging at different scales to obtain both wide-angle multispectral stereoscopic panoramic images and high-resolution color images. PanCam can view the lander upper surface and verify mechanism deployments and potentially the interaction of the drill and the rover wheels with the regolith. PanCam is the main ExoMars rover instrument for the remote characterization of the landing site's geological context, to provide detailed 3-D DTMs through stereo imaging and measure the surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF).\nThe two WACs will each generate multispectral stereo images with 38.3° field of view (FOV) (horizontal/vertical), and the HRC will provide monoscopic “zoom” images with 4.88° FOV (horizontal/vertical; see Table 2 ); the combination provides morphological information on the rover surroundings. The WACs use multiple narrow-band filters to constrain the mineral composition of rocks and soils and the concentration of water vapor and the dust optical properties in the atmosphere.\nThe HRC can acquire high-resolution subset images of the wide-angle panoramas, as well as image mosaics, and furthermore enables high-resolution imaging of inaccessible locations, for example, on steep slopes such as crater or valley walls. It also allows observation of retrieved subsurface samples before ingestion into the Sample Preparation and Distribution System (SPDS) of the Pasteur payload. Combined with a Rover Inspection Mirror (RIM), placed at the front end of the rover body, engineering images of the underside of the rover chassis as well as views of the rover wheels for soil mechanics science and wheel wear can be acquired with the HRC. In addition, views of the underside of overhanging rock formations may also be acquired.\nThe wide-angle (WACs) and close-up (HRC) capability thus provides imaging at different scales, from submillimeter resolution (HRC) directly in front of the rover up to millimeter-to-meter resolution to effectively infinite distances. These properties allow the acquisition of information to support rover navigation. PanCam is the only scientific instrument on the rover that can generate detailed 3-D DTMs, slope maps, and similar products. This will be complemented by lower-resolution Navigation Camera (NavCam) data. It should be noted that NavCam has a 65° FOV with a 150 mm stereo baseline and is accommodated on the mast in front of PanCam tilted down by 18° (Silva et al., 2013 ). After a drill site has been selected, using PanCam and other context information, the instrument can also view the drill tailings and thus provide complete geological context for the subsurface samples.\n2.2. Specific scientific goals\nCamera experiments are an indispensable component of the scientific payload of any surface planetary mission, whether it is a stationary lander or a mobile rover (e.g., Bell et al., 2003; Edgett et al., 2012 ; Gunn and Cousins, 2016 ; Maki et al., 2012 ). PanCam will study the geological diversity of individual local areas along the rover traverse and will be a significant contributor to the scientific output of ExoMars, particularly to characterization of surface geology and geomorphology, atmospheric sciences, and cartography/geodesy. Importantly, analysis of PanCam imagery will guide the selection of areas and rock outcrops for more detailed analysis and provide stratigraphic context for these sites. The application of stereo imaging will significantly enhance the ability of the science team to investigate terrain and geology through 3-D vision. DTMs and the corresponding texture maps in a visualization environment will enhance the quantitative analysis of the geomorphology and geology of target areas. In the following sections, we describe in detail the scientific objectives that will be addressed by PanCam.\n2.2.1. Geology and geomorphology\nThe major objective of PanCam imaging with respect to geology and geomorphology is the identification and characterization of rock and unconsolidated surficial units on the basis of their morphology, geometry, distribution, and physical (e.g., cohesion) and spectral properties (the latter will be addressed in the next section on color investigations). Perhaps the single most important contribution of PanCam science to the mission will be to help reconstruct the geological and geomorphological history of the ExoMars study area and in particular to define the stratigraphic context. This is crucial to place sample analysis in a geological spatial and relative temporal framework. The search for biosignatures requires an understanding of the local and regional geological context (e.g., Westall et al., 2015 ), which will be interpreted mainly, but not exclusively, from imaging data. As geological context encompasses the multiscale character of natural systems, context information for planetary rover missions will not only come from in situ data obtained by rover instruments but also from remote sensing data acquired by orbiter instruments. Therefore, it will be essential to link observations at multiple scales by combining rover and orbiter data (e.g., Golombek et al., 2005 , 2008 ; Arvidson et al., 2015 ; Stack et al., 2016 ). An immediate application of such combined data analysis will be the identification of landforms visible in both PanCam and orbiter images, which is key for a precise determination of the landing site location in a global geodetic reference frame (Oberst et al., 1999a , 1999b ; Haase et al., 2012 ). Ideally, such combined analysis will benefit from simultaneous and coordinated observations between PanCam and orbiter instruments enabling cross-calibration for, for example, spectro-photometric investigations (ground truth; e.g., Lichtenberg et al., 2007 ; Hoekzema et al., 2011 ; Fernando et al., 2015 ). Importantly, the need for context information applies to all dimensions and requires 3-D products from PanCam's stereo images (e.g., DTMs) as a spatial reference for other data (e.g., WISDOM, ISEM; Paar et al., 2015 ).\nThe search for biosignatures on Mars is considered to be most promising at sites of ancient geological strata that exhibit morphological, geological, and mineralogical evidence for sustained aqueous activity (e.g., Farmer and Des Marais, 1999 ; Grotzinger et al. 2014 , 2015; Vago et al., 2015 , 2017). The final three candidate landing sites for the ExoMars rover mission (Oxia Planum, Aram Dorsum, Mawrth Vallis) are all characterized by layered deposits suggestive of aqueous activity (depositional and/or alteration) (Bridges et al., 2016a ). Spatially resolved PanCam images and 3-D data products will be essential to study their sedimentary and compositional characteristics. Imaging is necessary to establish the local and regional stratigraphy (e.g., Lewis et al., 2008 ; Edgar et al., 2012 ; Grotzinger et al., 2015 ; Stack et al., 2015 ), for identification of lithologies indicative of aqueous processes (such as the conglomerates in Gale Crater; Williams et al., 2013 ), and for analyzing key sedimentological features such as cross-stratification (Grotzinger et al., 2006 , 2015; Lamb et al., 2012 ) or clinoforms (Grotzinger et al., 2015 ). High-resolution views from the HRC will allow the examination of rock textures (e.g., Herkenhoff et al., 2008 ) and the analysis of particle shape (e.g., Szabó et al., 2015 ; Yingst et al., 2016 ) and grain size distributions (e.g., Grotzinger et al., 2015 ). Smaller grain size measurements, however, require very high image resolution and typically require a microscopic imager (e.g., Jerolmack et al., 2006 ; Edgett et al., 2015 ), and it is likely that PanCam and CLUPI will need to work jointly toward this goal. In theory, PanCam images would also help identify potential morphological biosignatures such as microbially induced sedimentary structures (Noffke, 2009 ). This task, however, will require great care, as distinguishing microbially induced sedimentary structures from abiotic features is challenging (Cady et al., 2003 ; Davies et al., 2016 ) and needs to consider different scales of observation (Ibarra and Corsetti, 2016 ).\nData products derived from PanCam stereo images will permit the quantitative analysis of geological and geomorphic features of interest. A prime example is stratal layer geometry (thickness and attitude, i.e., strike and dip), which can be determined from rover stereo data (e.g., Metz et al., 2009 ; Stack, 2015 ). At larger scales, the geometry of surfaces can be investigated by combining rover images and DTMs derived from orbiter images (e.g., erosional unconformities; Watkins et al., 2016 ). The use of 3-D data is not restricted to sedimentary rock outcrops but will support the study of all surface phenomena. For instance, it also helps to constrain eolian processes (e.g., prevailing paleo-wind directions can be reconstructed from ventifact geometry; Bridges et al., 2014 ) and quantitatively analyze volcanic landforms (Squyres et al., 2007 ; Manga et al., 2012 ). Rock populations have been studied at all previous landing sites (Golombek et al., 2012 ), and PanCam images and 3-D data will be used to characterize their properties and to constrain their provenance (Craddock and Golombek, 2016 ).\nRover images and 3-D data can also support the study of physical properties of rocks (Nahm and Schultz, 2007 ; Okubo, 2007 ) and soils, for example, by viewing the disturbance of the soil by the mechanical interaction with a robotic arm or with rover wheels (e.g., Moore et al., 1987 ; Arvidson et al., 2004 ). Rover telemetry data in combination with rover image data have been used by Arvidson ( 2015 ) and Arvidson et al. ( 2017 ) to analyze the mechanical properties of the soils traversed by the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover, Curiosity.\nIn the case of ExoMars, PanCam will also image the growing accumulation of loose drill material around the borehole to examine its physical properties (e.g., the angle of repose) and mineralogical properties. Indeed, as the MSL rover has shown, the analysis of drill powders provides important information on rock properties below the ubiquitous dust layer and on the weathering profile with depth (e.g., Treiman et al., 2016 ). Importantly, PanCam multi-angle and spectral data (see below) will also enable the study of spectro-photometric properties of the traverse area (Johnson et al., 2008 , 2015 ).\n2.2.2. Rock and soil composition and mineralogy\nOne of the great successes of the Curiosity rover has been the identification of igneous rocks present as clasts from conglomerates of the fluvio-lacustrine system, for example, the Hottah Facies in Gale Crater (Williams et al., 2013 ). For instance, ChemCam compositional analyses together with complementary Mastcam, MAHLI, and ChemCam RMI imagery have shown the presence of feldspar-rich trachybasalts (Sautter et al., 2015 ; Bridges et al., 2016b ), indicating that the Gale catchment contained fractionated igneous rocks in addition to more primitive basalts. PanCam will likewise be able to reveal igneous textures and felsic/mafic mineral proportions, either within clasts in sediments or by imaging of in situ lava flows that have been hypothesized for parts of Oxia Planum (Quantin et al., 2015 ).\nA first-order assessment of the composition of surface materials, including level of oxidation, hydration, and extent of chemical alteration, will be provided by PanCam WAC and HRC color images and selected WAC multispectral data. Analysis of narrowband multispectral images using the “geology” filters ( Table 3 ) will be used to determine spectrally distinct units that can be correlated with structural features identified with WAC DTM data products (e.g., Fig. 2C ), building up a picture of sedimentary or volcanic structure, local stratigraphy, and geochemical evolution. This approach has been used previously to great effect using image data sets from the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Pancams (e.g., Farrand et al., 2006 , 2014 ; Rice et al., 2010 ). Since the deployment of 12-band “geology” multispectral imaging on NASA Pathfinder (Smith et al., 1997 ), subsequent missions have gradually modified the distribution of their geology filters across the 440–1000 nm wavelength range (Gunn and Cousins, 2016 ). Due to the exobiology focus of the ExoMars mission, the PanCam 12-band geology filter set was redesigned for the specific purpose of detecting minerals that had formed in the presence of liquid water (e.g., clays), while maintaining the ability of PanCam to also detect Fe2+- and Fe3+-bearing mineral phases common to Mars (Cousins et al., 2010 , 2012), for which this wavelength range is most sensitive. While these modified filters cover different center wavelengths, many are within 3–9 nm of those flown on previous missions, including the 432, 535, 601, 673, 904, and 1009 nm filters on board the MSL Mastcam and MER Pancams (Anderson and Bell, 2013 ). This enables spectral observations from previous missions to be correlated with those acquired with ExoMars. Analysis of these spectral bands ( Table 1 ), together with the other data sets produced by PanCam (and IR reflectance spectra from ISEM—see Korablev et al., 2017 , in this issue), will enable the identification of evidence of the paleoenvironment's habitability (see Harris et al., 2015 ), forming a major step in deciding where to drill. The ability of PanCam multispectral data products to characterize and distinguish between different mineralogical units produced by argillic alteration of basalt was demonstrated during a field deployment of a PanCam emulator on Mars analog terrains in Iceland (Harris et al., 2015 ).\nView larger version                                     (97K)\nFIG. 2.\nPanCam data products.

Spectral Parameters for ExoMars PanCam\nContext information is essential for the successful interpretation of multispectral data, and other rover missions have used spatially highly resolved imaging data as context for multispectral spot observations. For example, the main camera on the MERs, Pancam (Bell et al., 2003), provided such context for observations made by the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES; e.g., Christensen et al., 2004 ). More recently, the ChemCam instrument on the MSL rover Curiosity was equipped with a Remote Microscopic Imager (RMI) to provide geological context for the Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectrometer (LIBS) measurements (Maurice et al., 2012 ; Le Mouélic et al., 2015 ). In the same way, PanCam's HRC will not only provide context for PanCam's WAC color images but also for the ISEM spectrometer (Korablev et al., 2017 , in this issue). To ensure a common imaging direction and accurate positioning, the optical axes of the HRC and ISEM are coaligned.\n2.2.3. Landing site investigations\nFor the 2020 ExoMars launch, the landing site will be selected from Oxia Planum and one of either Aram Dorsum or Mawrth Vallis (Bridges et al., 2016a ). There are a number of hypotheses for each of the landing sites that will be investigated with PanCam and the other instruments. The final landing ellipse dimensions and azimuths have not been firmly determined for a 2021 landing, but current planning uses a semimajor axis of 50–60 km (Bridges et al., 2016a ).\n2.2.3.1. Oxia Planum (18.14°N, 335.76°E)\nOxia Planum is thought to be a layered, clay-rich Noachian terrain at the southeastern margin of the Chryse region. A long-lived aqueous system is suggested to have existed in Oxia Planum, including the distal deposits of an early Hesperian sedimentary fan that may represent an ancient deltaic sedimentary body (Quantin et al., 2015 ). Several valley systems converge at Oxia Planum, with the proposed delta being at the outlet of Coogoon Valles (Quantin et al., 2016 ).\nIn addition, Oxia Planum has an ancient, finely layered clay-bearing unit with surfaces that have been exposed as recently as 100 Ma (Quantin et al., 2015 ). That region, in the middle and western part of the ellipse, is thought to be part of a 200 m thick phyllosilicate unit, providing primary scientific targets throughout the landing ellipse (Quantin et al., 2014 ). These deposits have similarities with other phyllosilicate deposits, such as those at Mawrth Vallis, that occur throughout the wider western Arabia Terra and Meridiani region (Noe Dobrea et al., 2010 ), suggesting that alteration processes could have been intense over this entire region (Poulet et al., 2005 ).\nThe region also includes a 20 m thick Amazonian capping unit of uncertain, but possible volcanic, origin (Quantin et al., 2014 ). The regions of the phyllosilicate unit that are closest to the capping unit have the strongest CRISM (Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars) signatures for Fe/Mg phyllosilicates (Quantin et al., 2014 , 2015).\n2.2.3.2. Aram Dorsum (7.869°N, 348.8°E)\nAram Dorsum is part of an exhumed inverted fluvial channel system in a regional ancient alluvial landscape (Di Achille and Hynek, 2010 ; Balme et al., 2015 ; Sefton-Nash et al., 2015 ). There are Noachian-aged sedimentary rocks throughout the ellipse, providing scientific imaging targets for PanCam. The system has been exhumed from beneath mid/late Noachian-aged “etched terrains” (e.g., Hynek and Phillips, 2008 ), so the region has been protected from the martian environment for what could have been several billion years.\nAram Dorsum comprises a central inverted “trunk” fluvial channel system with smaller subsidiary channels feeding into it. Traces of buried channels can be seen at various stratigraphic levels, suggestive of a long duration of sediment aggradation (Balme et al., 2015 ; Sefton-Nash et al., 2015 ). The main trunk channel is surrounded by what are interpreted to be floodplain sedimentary deposits (Balme et al., 2014 ). The exposed region of the system is of the order of 10 km wide and 100 km long (Balme et al., 2014 ). The working hypothesis for this site is that it represents a relict aggradational alluvial system that was long-lived and involved migrating fluvial channels (Balme et al., 2014 ). Thus, it hosted a variety of alluvial depositional environments and likely comprised sedimentary rocks displaying a variety of grain sizes. The predicted long-duration nature of the system, and the potential for fine-grained alluvial sediments, makes Aram Dorsum a potentially good location for preserved biosignatures.\nAt the time of writing, there are very few CRISM images available for Aram Dorsum, with dust coverage obscuring the images that are available. However, at nearby Miyamoto Crater, Fe/Mg phyllosilicates were found on both sides of the channel (Marzo et al., 2009 ; Balme et al., 2015 ). The similarity in setting has been taken as an indication that Aram Dorsum could also contain similar phyllosilicates (Balme et al., 2015 )—again adding to the potential for biosignature preservation.\n2.2.3.3. Mawrth Vallis (22.16°N, 342.05°E)\nMawrth Vallis has abundant Fe/Mg phyllosilicates and associated layered terrains (Loizeau et al., 2010 , 2015 ). It is a well studied, mineralogically diverse site (Bishop et al., 2008 ), which together with its stratigraphy has been taken to suggest aqueous systems and a rich aqueous history (e.g., Michalski et al., 2010 ). It is predicted that biosignatures could be retained in the phyllosilicate and hydrated silica deposits, especially as there is no evidence for mixed-layer clays that would degrade the biosignatures (Poulet et al., 2014 ). In addition, the high clay content in Mawrth Vallis might allow organic preservation in paleosol paleoenvironments (Poulet et al., 2015 ). Reduced paleosols are thought to be excellent scientific targets, as reducing soils cause immediate preservation and therefore can concentrate organics (Poulet et al., 2014 ; Gross et al., 2016 ). There are clay transitions within the landing ellipse, transitioning from Fe-smectite to overlying Al-clays (kaolinite), as can be seen in CRISM images (Poulet et al., 2015 ).\nThe landing site at Mawrth Vallis is part of a large area with widespread layered deposits and evidence for draping relationships between some of them (Poulet et al., 2014 ). Erosional landforms superposed on the clay-rich succession are also present, such as channels and small capped buttes and mesas. Furthermore, as there are few “boulder-forming” units and the thermal inertia is low, it is assumed that the region is formed at least in part from fine-grained sedimentary rocks (Poulet et al., 2014 ). There is also a capping unit in Mawrth Vallis, which is thought to have buried the exobiology regions of interest. Like Aram Dorsum, these have been exhumed in geologically recent times (Poulet et al., 2015 ), which improves the biosignature preservation potential.\nGiven the three potential landing sites, the identification and measurement of sedimentary structures and determination of the sedimentary facies and stratigraphy will be an essential part of the ExoMars rover mission. Working hypotheses for the geological context will be developed—and here, PanCam's capabilities will be central—and used to interpret the paleoenvironments that the sedimentary rocks formed in. From here, the ExoMars science team will choose which locales to target and sample using the other instruments.\nThe key hypotheses and questions that PanCam will be deployed to help test and address at whichever of the landing sites is chosen are as follows:\n(I) If Oxia Planum is the site, (i) What is the nature and depositional environment of the clay-bearing units? (ii) Are the Oxia clays truly the lower members of the more varied clay sequence observed at Mawrth? Is this a major regional alteration landscape? (iii) If the rover can reach the geographically constrained fan-shaped landform, is it a delta? (iv) Is the capping unit in Oxia Planum volcanic?\n(II) (i) Is Aram Dorsum an exhumed, alluvial depositional system? (ii) If so, are fine-grained floodplain and local lacustrine deposits present? (iii) Are phyllosilicates present in the Aram Dorsum region?\n(III) (i) What are the depositional or diagenetic environments for the various clay mineral–hosting strata documented at Mawrth Vallis? (ii) Does Mawrth Vallis contain evidence for paleosols? (iii) What is the significance and nature of the transition from Fe-smectite to Al-clays?\n2.2.4. Support of exobiology\nPanCam data will support the overarching exobiological objective of ExoMars through the characterization of paleoenvironments that involved sustained liquid water at the ExoMars study site. While water alone does not ensure habitability (e.g., Knoll and Grotzinger, 2006 ; Grotzinger et al. 2014 ; Fox-Powell et al., 2016 ), it provides the basis for current exobiological exploration of Mars (Rummel et al., 2014 ). Since 2012, MSL Curiosity MastCam data have revealed evidence of fluvio-lacustrine sedimentary deposits (Grotzinger et al., 2014 , 2015) and diagenetic veins and related mineralogy (McLennan et al., 2014 ; Nachon et al., 2014 ; Bridges et al., 2015 ; Schwenzer et al., 2016 ). Critical information for construction of the stratigraphic framework of sedimentary rocks along the rover traverse and their sedimentological and paleoenvironmental interpretation has been provided by MastCam, including images of fluvial conglomerates (Williams et al., 2013 ), a variety of cross-stratification structures, fine-scale lamination indicative of lacustrine sedimentation, and sulfate and Mg-rich veins cutting though the sediments (Grotzinger et al., 2014 , 2015).\nMastCam observations have also demonstrated how large-scale stratigraphic relationships between geological units along the rover traverse can be understood within the context of CRISM mineralogical data (Seelos et al., 2014 ; Grotzinger et al., 2015 ). The role of PanCam on ExoMars will be much the same, and its combination of wide-angle, high-resolution, 3-D, and multispectral visualization ( Fig. 2 ) will enable a thorough evaluation of the geological context for both drill-site selection and subsequent interpretation of sample analyses. Specific to ExoMars is the necessity to identify those lithologies most likely to harbor evidence for organic biosignatures (Farmer and Des Marais, 1999 ; Parnell et al., 2007 ), and the degree and type of post-depositional processes that have affected them. To this end, identification of reduced, phyllosilicate-bearing sediments will be a particular priority due to the hypothesis of preferential preservation of organic matter by clay minerals (Ehlmann et al., 2008 ). PanCam (HRC and WAC) will be an important tool in this, but this will be augmented by the use of a relevant suite of spectrometers (e.g., ISEM and the Raman spectrometer). The three potential landing sites satisfy this criterion, having either spectral evidence for abundant clays (Oxia Planum, Mawrth Vallis) or geological features that suggest environments where fine-grained sediment is likely to have accumulated (Aram Dorsum).\nDetermination of the subsurface stratigraphic extent of candidate sampling strata through combining PanCam DTMs of rock outcrops with WISDOM data (Ciarletti et al., 2017 , in this issue) will also be a key input into deciding where to drill. The three landing sites are all hypothesized to contain fine-grained sedimentary rocks. Burial of such deposits is likely to have been associated with diagenesis, for example, the formation of clay and iron oxide through the dissolution of olivine, and the creation of secondary mineral veins (Léveillé et al., 2014 ; Bridges et al., 2015 ). The role of post-emplacement diagenetic processes is of particular importance given the ability of diagenetic processes either to mineralize (preserve) or destroy/displace organic biosignatures, in addition to UV and oxidative degradation of organic material (ten Kate, 2010 ). A key finding from the MSL Curiosity mission has been the prevalence of diagenetic hydrated calcium sulfate fracture-fill veins, which formed from circumneutral fluids at relatively low temperatures (<50°C) and pressures (Nachon et al., 2014 ; Schwenzer et al., 2016 ). Remote detection of deposits such as these with PanCam will be achieved through a combination of WAC multispectral (color, hydration band identification) and HRC (mineral vein morphology and crystal habits) data. Likewise, combined HRC and WAC multispectral data will also be used to detect other low-temperature secondary mineralization features that have the potential to trap organic matter during precipitation, including evaporitic salt phases, zeolite mineralization, and carbonates, which can then be corroborated with ISEM spectral data to identify and spatially extrapolate their mineralogy across a PanCam scene.\n2.2.5. Atmospheric science\nThe major changes on the martian surface that can be detected by PanCam are caused by eolian processes and condensation of volatiles, which directly reflect variations in the prevailing near-surface wind regime, and the diurnal and seasonal volatile and dust cycles. Atmospheric studies will concentrate on the detection of clouds, measurements of the aerosol contents, and the water vapor absorption at 936 nm (Titov et al., 1999 ). Although currently present at only ∼30 ppm near the surface, the atmospheric water vapor distribution is vital to understanding the water exchange with the regolith and its loss to space. It may also be affected at high altitudes by any nearby crustal magnetic fields. The abundance of water vapor in the instrument line of sight will be inferred by measuring the 936 nm absorption feature, utilizing the 925 nm (continuum) and 935 nm solar filters ( Table 3 ). By direct imaging of the setting Sun, this feature will be measured as a function of zenith angle, to probe vertical distribution in the near-surface layers. These properties of abundance and vertical profile will be retrieved with the radiative transfer and retrieval tool NEMESIS (Non-linear optimal Estimator for MultivariatE Spectral analysIS) (Irwin et al., 2008 ). NEMESIS is a versatile tool designed for application to any planet and has retrieved vertical water vapor distributions at Mars (Lolachi et al., 2007 ) as well as atmospheric properties of Titan (Teanby et al., 2007 ), Saturn (Fletcher et al., 2007 ), Jupiter (Irwin et al., 2004 ), and Venus (De Kok et al., 2011 ), for a range of viewing geometries.\nScattering by dust particles (aerosols) controls the quantity of light in the sky and its spectral distribution (Thomas et al., 1999 ). Dust particles stripped from dust layers on the ground and ice, nucleated together, are important components of the aerosol load in the atmosphere. The vertical optical depth of aerosols in the atmosphere of Mars varies strongly, depending on meteorological conditions such as temperature and atmospheric pressure. The results obtained at the MER and MSL landing sites concerning atmospheric conditions were discussed by Smith et al. ( 2006 ), Moores et al. ( 2013 ), and Webster et al. ( 2013 ). PanCam will use images of the sky observed near sunset to determine scattering properties of the dust particles via simulation with NEMESIS (Kleinböhl et al., 2011 ), in conjunction with observations from meteorology packages on the ExoMars landing platform. The coordination of multiple instrument observations of optical depth has been successful in constraining aerosol properties over previous missions (Lemmon et al., 2004 ; Wolff et al., 2006 ). The variation of scattering properties with altitude may be inferred by observing the sky after sunset, when increasingly higher levels in the atmosphere are illuminated by sunlight (Markiewicz et al., 1999 ).\nIn addition to studies of dust particles and other aerosols, lander- and rover-based cameras have been used successfully to study and monitor cloud activity on Mars (e.g., Moores et al., 2010 , 2015 ), and PanCam will continue this endeavor, including using automated techniques (e.g., Francis et al., 2014 ).\nThe observations of these atmospheric properties across the mission duration will provide temporal data, contributing to the optical depth record accumulated and reviewed by Lemmon et al. ( 2015 ). The collected observations made by the ExoMars rover, landing platform instruments, and Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) will provide further insights into the characteristics and evolution of the martian atmosphere.\n2.3. Operational planning\nThe planning of all rover operations relies heavily on visual information provided by various camera systems (e.g., Bell et al., 2003). The ExoMars rover will have a nominal lifetime of 218 sols (approximately 7 Earth months). During this period, a total drive distance of several kilometers is expected (Vago et al., 2017 , in this issue). To plan drives and analytical campaigns, a daily process of localization and navigation planning will be necessary. This will make use of the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in particular, and to some extent imagery from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on Mars Express and the Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS) on the ExoMars 2016 TGO, together with the ExoMars rover navigation and localization cameras. Complementary to the onboard guidance navigation and control (GNC, Winter et al., 2015 ), which performs relative localization in reaction to a predefined local path, absolute localization [both for strategic (daily) and tactical (longer-term) planning] will be performed in the Rover Operations and Control Center (ROCC) at the ALTEC premises in Turin. The PanCam 3-D vision workflow PRoViP (Paar et al., 2009 ; see also Section 5.3 in this paper) will be able to interpret PanCam, NavCam, and Localization Camera (LocCam) data and generate 3-D vision products (panoramas and DTMs). These data are expected to be available on a daily basis to be used for scientific planning for that sol.\nFor absolute localization, given that high-resolution satellite DTMs/ortho images in the range of 0.5 m resolution or better are available, rover DTMs are projected into an orthorectified mosaic, which uses the XYZ location of each pixel to create a true overhead view. These mosaics are then compared with orbital (e.g., HiRISE) views of the terrain to pinpoint exactly where the rover is in terms of latitude and longitude on the martian surface (Tao et al., 2016 ). A Path Planning module based on the local DTM will facilitate the long-term route planning. A traverse-monitoring map will show areas within which the rover is allowed to enter or not.\nPanCam single images, mosaics, and stereo products will provide essential higher-resolution views of potential scientific targets, sometimes with geology filters. It is envisaged that some PanCam imagery and stereo DTMs will be available in the daily cycle of downloads, with the number of PanCam products varying according to scientific priorities and data downlink rates. A key strength of ExoMars science is expected to be the rapid integration of PanCam stereo imagery with additional 3-D information into the science and drive planning process.\n2.4. Synergies with other instruments\nAn important scientific property of the Pasteur payload instruments is their ability to contribute to the successive chain of observations aiming to collect the best possible samples for analysis. PanCam is the first link in this chain.\nThe PanCam WACs will obtain panoramic scale information needed to characterize the rover's surroundings. Without the need to move the rover, PanCam HRC, in combination with the IR spectrometer ISEM, can secure detailed, high-resolution visual and spectral data on faraway candidate targets. Armed with these results, the science team can make an informed decision regarding which geological targets to inspect at close range.\nOnce the rover has reached a scientifically interesting objective, for example, a sedimentary rock outcrop that could have been deposited in an aqueous environment, PanCam WAC, PanCam HRC, and ISEM can work in a concerted manner to study the target. This characterization can be used to determine which portion of the outcrop to investigate at very high resolution with CLUPI, the close-up imager accommodated on the ExoMars drill.\nPanCam can also support rover operations when performing subsurface scanning maneuvers. These are predefined trajectories executed by the rover in order to construct 2-D and 3-D models using the WISDOM Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and the ADRON neutron detector. They allow the determination of, respectively, the subsurface stratigraphy under the rover (including the existence of potential obstacles) and the subsoil's level of hydration—both important for deciding where to drill.\nPanCam and CLUPI can work in tandem to visually examine outcrops and rocks at progressively higher resolution, that is, overall views with the WACs, imaging at millimeter scale with the HRC, and detailed textural studies at tens-of-microns scale with CLUPI.\nPanCam and CLUPI can also monitor drilling operations. As the drill penetrates into the ground, a mound of fines will be collected at its base. CLUPI can obtain very detailed images of these fines at 39 and 13 (drill lowered) μm/pixel (Josset et al., 2017, in this issue). However, via the RIM, or once the rover has backed away, it is the PanCam HRC that can inspect the entire collection of fines, revealing any heterogeneity in the grains. This information can be compared with the borehole wall data obtained by the Ma_MISS IR spectrometer integrated in the drill tip.\nFinally, the PanCam HRC and CLUPI are tasked with imaging the sample deposited by the drill on the Core Sample Transport Mechanism (CSTM)—a small drawer emerging through a port on the front of the rover to receive the sample. Once again, CLUPI can obtain high-resolution images (∼20 μm/pixel) of portions of the sample, but the PanCam HRC will achieve a top view of the complete sample prior to its delivery to the analytical laboratory for further processing and analysis.\nIn summary, the use of PanCam in synergy with all the rover's external instruments constitutes a major requirement for achieving the mission's scientific objectives.\nAlthough not strictly an instrument, the rover locomotion system itself (Poulakis et al., 2015 ) will provide PanCam with numerous scientific opportunities, for example, wheel-soil interaction studies based on mechanical properties of the terrain material that the rover will traverse, which can be assessed with PanCam and CLUPI. The results of these investigations will help improve predictions for tractive performance of flexible wheels on different terrains and slopes (the rover includes wheel slip sensors and is able to assess effective traverse progress optically). The wheels of the rover can also be used to conduct trenching observations (planned or otherwise) where PanCam and CLUPI can directly inspect (shallow) excavated material deemed interesting.\n3. Instrument Design\n3.1. Instrument overview\nThe PanCam design (total mass 2.13 kg with margin) includes the following major items:\n(a) Wide Angle Camera (WAC) pair, for multispectral stereoscopic panoramic imaging, using a miniaturized filter wheel. The WAC units themselves are provided by RUAG and Space-X, Switzerland, and the filter wheels and drives are produced by Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL), University College London (UCL).\n(b) High Resolution Camera (HRC) for high-resolution color images. The HRC hardware is produced by OHB, Oberfaffenhofen, and DLR Institute for Planetary Research, Berlin, Germany.\n(c) PanCam Interface Unit and DC-DC converter (PIU and DCDC) to provide a single electronic interface. The PIU and DCDC are provided by MSSL-UCL.\n(d) PanCam Optical Bench (OB) to house PanCam and provide planetary and dust protection. The OB is provided by MSSL-UCL.\nThe PanCam mechanical design is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The OB is located on a rover-supplied pan-tilt mechanism at the top of the rover mast, at a height of ∼2 m above the surface (Silva et al., 2013 ).\nA summary of the main characteristics of PanCam is shown in Table 2 .\nTable 2. Main PanCam Characteristics and Resources\nEach of the WACs includes 11 filters comprising R, G, and B color bands, a geological filter set [optimized for use on Mars by Cousins et al. ( 2010 , 2012 )], and atmospheric filters to analyze the water and dust content in the martian atmosphere. The filter wheel and WAC system are illustrated in Fig. 4 .\nView larger version                                     (51K)\nFIG. 4.\nFront and rear CAD views of the right WAC assembly, showing the filter wheel and stepper motor. The left WAC and right WAC filter sets are not identical; they include RGB, narrow-band geology, and solar.\nInformation about Downloading\nThe HRC includes R, G, and B filters bonded to the detector chips to provide color information. The optical path is housed within the OB structure and comprises a baffle and mirror arrangement, a focus mechanism, and a detector with associated readout electronics (see Fig. 5 ).\nInformation about Downloading\nThe PIU is the main interface between the ExoMars rover and the PanCam subsystems, and uses an FPGA implementation. The final system component is the OB, which provides a planetary protection barrier to the external environment (including HEPA filters), as well as mechanical positioning of the PanCam components. A view of the structural-thermal model (STM) OB is shown in Fig. 6 .\nInformation about Downloading\nIn addition to the four major PanCam OB-mounted components outlined above, three additional “Small Items” hardware components are part of the PanCam design to improve the scientific return and provide useful engineering data. These are the calibration target (shared with ISEM), fiducial markers, and a rover inspection mirror (see Section 3.5). We note that data formatting and compression are performed within the rover electronics system.\n3.2. Wide angle cameras (WACs) and filter wheel\nEach WAC contains a STAR1000 APS-based camera with wide-angle optics and a filter wheel containing 11 filters ( Figs. 4 and 7 ).\nView larger version                                     (27K)\nFIG. 7.\nWAC block diagram showing the STAR1000 CMOS sensor with temperature sensor, the FPGA and image memory, connector, and LVDS drivers.\nInformation about Downloading\nThe 1 megapixel (1024 × 1024) STAR1000 detector is digitized to 10 bits with the onboard ADC. This CMOS active pixel sensor (APS) detector was selected to reduce the number of voltage lines required and the complexity of the support circuitry (compared to a traditional CCD sensor), thus allowing lighter, more compact camera heads to be designed. The STAR1000 was developed to be extremely radiation resistant (∼100 Krad, Cos et al., 2006 ) for long-duration geostationary missions and has flown previously as a star tracker detector (Schmidt et al., 2015 ). It was selected at a phase in the ExoMars mission evolution when a 1.5–2 year interplanetary cruise phase near solar maximum was foreseen. The sensor is currently in flight on the Mascot lander aboard the Hyabusa 2 spacecraft (Jaumann et al., 2016 ) and will be further qualified, for the demanding ∼200 thermal cycles it will see on the surface of Mars, as part of a life test model as part of the PanCam Assembly, Integration, and Test (AIT) phase. The product of quantum efficiency and fill factor of the STAR1000 is above 20% for most of the visible (i.e., 470–710 nm) but falls monotonically to 7% at 400 nm and only 3% at 1000 nm. To compensate for these quantum efficiency limitations, the WAC filter band passes systematically increase at both long and short wavelengths ( Table 3 ), maintaining relatively constant integration times by increasing the light energy reaching the sensor [as described in the filter selection paper by Cousins et al. ( 2012 )].\nTable 3. WAC Filter Properties for the Left Filter Wheel (Top Half) and the Right Filter Wheel (Bottom Half)\nThe fixed-focus, f = 21.85 mm optics provide in-focus images from approximately 0.85 m to infinity (optimized for 1.9 m). PSF modeling indicates >80% of a point source's energy is contained within the central 15-micron square pixel. This figure is a worst-case value for the edge of the field with performance improving toward the optical axis. The data from the detector are digitized to 10 bits. Stereo images are acquired with a 500 mm baseline and 2.8° toe-in (per “eye”), optimized for stereo vision at 5 m from the rover. The broadband red color filters in both WACs are used for stereo imaging, while in the same sequence images are taken through the green and blue broadband filters from one WAC (known as “RRGB”) to produce an RGB color texture to “drape” over the 3-D terrain model recovered from the stereo data. PanCam is mounted on top of the rover deployable mast array (DMA) some 2 m above the martian surface. From this position it can be panned (around the vertical axis) ±180° and tilted (around the horizontal axis) ±90°, from the straight-ahead position. This allows the WACs to image the PanCam Calibration Target (PCT) and Fiducial Markers (FidMs) on the rover deck and science targets on the (unobscured) martian surface and in the sky above the rover.\nEach WAC is composed of a gold-colored cube containing the power, memory, and sensor PCBs embedded in a protective epoxy attached to the 53° (diagonal) FOV lens. Unlike the HRC, the WAC design [incorporating over 20 years of development heritage—e.g., Beauvivre et al. ( 1999 ), Josset et al. ( 2006 ), Griffiths et al. ( 2005 )] calls for standalone modules containing 512 Mbits of memory storage for up to 50 images. The WAC is mounted to the OB just behind an 11-position filter wheel, turned by a stepper motor via a 64:1 gearbox (0.28° of filter wheel rotation per motor step). A Hall effect sensor detects magnets located along the periphery of the wheel (and also at the home position) to allow the PIU to determine the current filter location.\nThe 22 (total) filters are divided into three functional groups: 2 × R, G & B broadband color imaging filters (6), narrow-band geology filters in the 400–1000 nm wavelength range (12), and ultra-narrow-band solar filters (4) for dust optical density and water vapor absorption studies. The solar filters include a factor of ∼10−5 band pass attenuation to allow solar imaging without the detector saturating at even the minimum integration time. The filter center wavelength, pass band, and other properties are shown in Table 3 . Since data bandwidth limits will rarely allow the use of all 12 geology filters on extended targets, ratios of certain filters (shown with bold IDs in Table 3 )—for example, G03 and G05; G02, G06, and G01; and G07, G10, G11, and G12—will be used to identify diagnostic slopes, knees, or bands expected from hydrated clays, salts, or other minerals of exobiological interest (Harris et al., 2015 ).\n3.3. High Resolution Camera (HRC)\nThe PanCam HRC will be one of the few landscape-viewing cameras on Mars to be equipped with active focus capability, enabling it to reveal details near or far with about 8-fold better resolution than the WACs (and comparable to the 100 mm focal length, MastCam100 on the Curiosity rover).\nIn particular, HRC images will allow for high-resolution views of “Regions of Interest” within WAC wide-angle panoramas, as well as high-resolution imaging of rover-inaccessible locations on, for example, crater walls or in valleys. Combined with the RIM, placed at the front end of the rover body, high-resolution engineering images of the rover underside as well as views of the rover wheels for soil mechanics science or views of the underside of overhanging rock formations can be acquired.\nThe HRC is physically located inside the PanCam OB. The position of the viewing port next to the right WAC has been optimized to provide a top view of retrieved subsurface samples deposited by the drill on the CSTM.\nThe optical design is centered on a STAR1000 1024 × 1024 pixel CMOS detector, with 15 μm pixel size. Illuminated by a 180 mm EFL, f/16 lens (Cooke triplet), the detector enables detailed images of near and distant objects: the 4.88° square FOV takes images with a scale of ∼0.17 mm per pixel at 2 m distance and 8.5 cm per pixel at 1 km distance. PSF modeling indicates >70% of a point source's energy is contained within the central 15-micron square pixel. This figure is a worst-case value for the edge of the field with performance improving toward the optical axis. Physically, the HRC consists of the focal plane and control electronics PCBs, the focus drive stage with the lens barrel on top, the folding mirror assembly, and the entrance window (see Figs. 8 and 9 ). A major difference from the WAC is that the HRC lacks local image storage memory; instead, to simplify the design, the image data are transmitted directly to the PIU and buffered there. From the entrance window, the light is directed through an external and internal stray light baffle onto a 45° folding mirror. Inside the OB, an internal short wall carries a second internal baffle that directs the light onto the Cooke-triplet lens.\nView larger version                                     (32K)\nFIG. 9.\nHRC block diagram showing the STAR1000 CMOS sensor with temperature sensor, the FPGA (center), connectors, power conditioning, and LVDS drivers (right) and finally the focus motor control circuitry (left).\nInformation about Downloading\nTo enable active focusing, the lens group sits on a focus drive stage, which is mechanically actuated by a stepper motor for obtaining well-focused images between ∼1 m (distance to the sample on the CSTM) and infinity. Through a second short wall and third internal baffle, the light finally reaches the focal plane with the image sensor.\nThe HRC uses the same monochrome APS as the two WACs. However, instead of a filter wheel, an affixed red-green-blue filter strip over the CMOS detector is used. 1 Covering the spectral range from 440 to 654 nm (at FWHM), the three filter bands (covering, respectively, 342, 341, and 341 pixels horizontally) are blue (475 ± 35 nm), green (542.5 ± 22.5 nm), and red (635 ± 19 nm)—see Fig. 10 . For color image acquisition, using the three stripe filters on the detector, the camera head has to be panned over the full FOV to mosaic each color swath across the detector FOV. We note that optical testing of the HRC elegant breadboard revealed stray light issues relating to the filter; these have been mitigated by adding a black coating to the filter edges.\nView larger version                                     (32K)\nFIG. 10.\n(Left) RGB strip filter, directly glued onto the active area of the STAR1000 detector. (Right) Filter transmission curve of the RGB filter strips.\nInformation about Downloading\nConnected to the focal plane via a flex layer is the control electronics PCB, which houses all HRC electronics, including camera control, autofocus and autofocus motor control, and interface control.\nTo satisfy the stringent alignment requirements, the focal plane is placed on an isostatically mounted bracket. Shims between the focal plane bracket and the OB, as well as shims between the folding mirror bracket and OB, can be used to further adjust height and angular alignment during integration.\nThe autofocus algorithm is newly developed by the HRC team. An adapted global search strategy is used to search for the sharpest image within the focus range. The sharpness of an image is determined within a 32 × 32, 64 × 64, 128 × 128, or 256 × 256 window by Sobel filtering and calculation of the mean of the root-squared image gradients in x and y direction. The sharpness at the initial motor position is calculated by moving the motor either forward or backward depending on the current focus position, with a step length of 3 mm. Again, the image sharpness is calculated, and the motor movement direction is changed if the sharpness is lower than the initial sharpness. Then, steps of 1 mm are executed, and the image sharpness is calculated iteratively until a coarse global maximum sharpness is found. At the final stage, the step size is reduced to find the global maximum image sharpness. Although range estimation is not required for the HRC autofocus, the drive stage can be set by command at a position calculated based on range-to-target information from the WAC stereo products.\n3.4. Optical bench (OB)\nPanCam's internal components are contained in an OB. An OB was selected to provide the instrument with protection from the martian environment (e.g., dust) and to provide the martian environment protection from any contaminants brought from Earth by the instrument. The OB is vented with a HEPA filter to equalize pressure but maintain cleanliness. In addition, the rigidity of the OB helps maintain a stable structure from which to acquire stereo imaging.\nThe OB is of aluminum construction with dimensions of 562 × 70 × 113 mm (L × H × D). The walls are machined from a single aluminum block, and afterward the interior is cut out by using electrical discharge machining wire cutting. Wire cutting allows the OB to have thinner walls than could be machined from a solid block, resulting in a lightweight rigid structure.\nThe base is electron-beam welded to the wall structure, and the lid is secured to the top of the bench by a series of fasteners once the internal components are mounted. In this configuration, the box makes a very stiff, extremely light monocoque structure. The mass of the OB itself, including 12% margin, is just under 780 g.\nThe interior of the OB is painted with a black paint (Z306) to cut down on stray light. Aeroglaze Z-306 has a reflectance of ∼8% BoL in the visible (Gilmore, 2002 ) and a few percent in the NIR (Ames, 1990 ). The exterior of the OB is coated with A276, a space-qualified white paint that aids PanCam thermal control. Equally importantly, A276 is compatible with ExoMars planetary protection guidelines; it is glossy and smooth, so it is less likely to harbor spores and other bioburden. It can also withstand dry heat microbial reduction sterilization.\n3.5. Supporting electronics—PanCam Interface Unit (PIU) + DC-DC converter (DCDC)\nThe function of the PIU is to provide a single interface for all three cameras to the rover and this is achieved by using the SpaceWire RMAP interface protocol. The PIU receives the SpaceWire RMAP packets and executes them as required and forwarding the command to the cameras. Due to power constraints, only a single camera can be powered at any one time. The active camera is selected by the PIU using power switches.\nSingle alternating WAC operation (e.g., during stereo image acquisition) is not expected to present problems maintaining operating temperature. This is because thermal modeling indicates that the low thermal conductance to the OB means that one camera is unlikely to cool significantly in the few minutes it is switched off (while the other is acquiring the matching image in the stereo pair). Alternating camera use during a sequence of stereo pairs allows heat loss from each camera to be minimized.\nThe PIU is responsible for control of the filter wheels. The PIU maintains locally the Rover Elapsed Time (RET) in order to allow time-stamping of HK packets and image data. In addition to time stamps, images can be identified by a unique image ID that is embedded in the image metadata and contains parameters such as the sol date and task ID. Owing to PanCam's position on the end of the mast and again to power limitations, the instrument does not have any survival heaters and follows the martian surface temperature.\nTherefore, the cameras will generally be operated during the day when surface temperatures are above −40°C (to reduce power required for heating). An exception may be the solar observations just prior to sunset (sunrise observations likely being precluded by power and thermal restrictions). However, since the rover is solar powered, it is similarly limited to daytime operations when the dust opacity is low enough to enable (and any seasonal constraints allow) a suitable operating power margin to be maintained (Vago, 2012 ).\nGiven this, the PIU provides autonomous camera unit temperature control and monitoring with secondary power for the heaters. Moreover, the PIU is responsible for the control of the filter wheels. The performance and state of PanCam is monitored though the Housekeeping packets generated by the PIU. These Housekeeping packets are also used by the rover to detect any off-nominal behavior and take the appropriate actions.\nA single DC-DC converter, which is housed in a dedicated compartment of the OB, provides the galvanically isolated secondary rails as required by the rest of the instrument. The DC-DC converter converts the 28 V primary power bus to three different voltages:\n• 12 V, used to drive the filter wheels and the HRC focus actuator;\n• 6 V, which powers the various digital components (switched to power the cameras as needed);\n• 1.5 V, used by the PanCam FPGA.\nThe DC-DC converter incorporates a number of features such as current limiting designed to safeguard the rest of the instrument in the event of a component failure or upset.\n3.6. Small Items\nThe PanCam “Small Items” consist of additional passive hardware to aid the surface operations of PanCam and allow in situ calibration. These items include the PCT, the FidMs, and the RIM. The PCT and FidMs are mounted on the rover deck and the RIM on the left-hand suspension bogie bracket as shown in Fig. 11 .\nInformation about Downloading\n3.6.1. PanCam Calibration Target (PCT)\nThe PCT provides an in situ calibration target for the radiometric calibration of PanCam on the martian surface. The PCT has a mass of 36.2 g excluding mounting screws and consists of an aluminum structure with a surface area of 67 × 76 mm, which mechanically retains eight colored glass and ceramic calibration patches. Six of the calibration patches (red, yellow, green/blue, blue, and two gray) have an exposed diameter of 18 mm and will be used only for PanCam calibration. Colored glass was selected for the calibration patches, as the color has excellent resistance to UV-induced fading and damage from the moderate doses of ionizing radiation it will encounter during the mission. The surfaces of the calibration patches are processed to obtain a diffuse reflection, and the back surface is aluminized to increase the total reflectance. The glass for the six small calibration patches is standard Schott colored and neutral-density filter glass.\nThe white and multiband calibration patches have an exposed diameter of 30 mm and will be used for the radiometric and spectral calibration of ISEM (Korablev et al., 2017 , in this issue) in addition to PanCam. WCT-2065 (a rare earth doped glass developed by NIST and manufactured by Schott) is used to provide well-defined bands for spectral calibration applications in the visible and NIR. The white calibration patch is Pyroceram manufactured by the Vavilov State Optical Institute in St. Petersburg.\nThe calibration patches will be calibrated for absolute reflectance in total hemispherical/8° geometry and BRDF so that the angle of incident solar illumination can be compensated for. The PCT includes two shadow posts to allow the level of indirect (scattered) skylight to be assessed and aid in the determination of the illumination direction and angle.\nThe PCT is mounted on the front of the rover deck in a region as clear as possible from sources of shadowing and stray light and will be viewed by PanCam from an angle of ∼23° from the vertical. Measurements of the light scattered by the PCT will allow the level of incident illumination to be determined over the PanCam and ISEM spectral range. In combination with preflight calibration data, these measurements will allow PanCam images to be processed to obtain calibrated data products such as spectral parameter images and relative reflectance spectra of objects in the FOV.\nDust deposition on the PCT during the ExoMars mission will be accounted for in the data processing by developing a radiative transfer model of the PCT/dust system, building on the results of previous missions (Johnson et al., 2002 ; Bell et al., 2006; Kinch et al., 2007 , 2015 ). This will use laboratory measurements of Mars analog dust (JSC Mars-1; Allen et al., 1997 ) on the PCT prototype as with the MER calibration target (Johnson et al., 2006 ) and measurements of settling rates derived from the rover solar array power output (Stella et al., 2005 ).\n3.6.2. Fiducial Markers (FidMs)\nTogether with the PCT, the three FidMs form two right-angle triangles on the rover deck to allow in situ geometric calibration of the PTU/PanCam system. Each FidM consists of a single piece of aluminum, anodized black and with the center section ground back to aluminum to provide high contrast. The center hole in each FidM provides a mounting point for geometric reference targets for preflight calibration activities. The FidMs have dimensions of 32 × 16 × 6.5 mm and a mass of 1.2 g excluding mounting screws.\n3.6.3. Rover Inspection Mirror (RIM)\nThe RIM is a 50 mm diameter convex spherical mirror machined and polished from aluminum, with a radius of curvature of 30 mm mounted on an aluminum bracket. The RIM assembly has a mass of 21.8 g excluding mounting screws. The RIM will be imaged by the HRC and will allow the drill spoil heap to be observed while drilling is taking place. It will also allow the underside of the rover to be observed for diagnosis in the event of problems with uneven surfaces, the drivetrain, and so on. The RIM will also allow the PanCam instrument to take “selfies” of the rover for publicity and outreach purposes.\n4. Measurement Scenario\n4.1. Usage of PanCam\nThe ExoMars mission plan is to explore the martian terrain near the landing site using a series of six experiment cycles and two vertical surveys (Vago et al., 2015 , 2017). The rover will target outcrops as indicators of buried rock masses that may extend below the radiation-altered and oxidized layers to depths of >1.5 m where molecular fossils may have survived for billions of years.\nA “reference surface mission,” involving experiment cycles, has been designed to provide the necessary requirements for sizing the rover. The discussion in this section is based on that existing plan, which also provides a rough template for achieving the main scientific goals during the nominal surface mission. We fully appreciate that the detailed planning for Mars operations will vary significantly from this scenario. Inputs from the science and engineering teams for PanCam and other instruments will be generated on a daily basis as the mission progresses, in reaction to the martian terrain and environment and to the state of the rover.\nIn an experiment cycle (EC), the rover uses the Pasteur payload (over a period of 14 sols, with another 4 sols reserved for traveling between EC sites) to home in on a suitable outcrop from which to acquire samples (Vago, 2012 ). For particularly promising EC sites, a vertical survey can be conducted where samples are returned every 50 cm from the surface to the maximum drilling depth of 2 m.\nThe EC can be divided into an approach phase (3–4 sols) and a sampling phase (10–11 sols). At the beginning of the approach phase, the rover can be up to 20 m distant from a possible drill target, so a PanCam WAC panorama of up to 10 RRGB color/stereo images of the area ahead of the rover is acquired on the first sol. At the same time, HRC RGB color images and co-registered ISEM spectra (Korablev et al., 2017 , in this issue) of promising rocks (seen during the ∼100 m drive from the previous EC location) are acquired. From these data, an outcrop target will be chosen for the rover to approach to ∼3 m on the second sol. ADRON (Mitrofanov et al., 2017 , in this issue) and WISDOM (Ciarletti et al., 2017 , in this issue) surveys are conducted during the approach phase. A WAC image using either all 12 geology filters or selected groups (as discussed in Section 3.1) is taken of the outcrop along with a mosaic of eight HRC color images (and again eight co-registered ISEM spectra). Then on the third sol, a HRC color context image is taken of the potential drill target area to be imaged in greater detail by CLUPI. Subsequently, CLUPI will acquire up to six images (with depth from focus position information) to characterize rock microtexture and select a location to drill. Finally, on the forth sol of the approach phase, a surface sample is acquired and imaged by the HRC and CLUPI before ingestion into the ALD by the HRC and CLUPI. In this way, PanCam forms part of the “remote sensing” part of the Pasteur payload (along with WISDOM, ADRON, ISEM, and CLUPI) used to determine where to drill and acquire a sample.\nDuring the EC sampling phase, the “remote sensing” instruments are used less frequently, with the ALD instruments taking center stage. However, assuming the surface sample results are promising, on the sixth sol a 6-position WAC RRGB mosaic is acquired to help plan a WISDOM pattern search for a location to drill deeper for unaltered samples. The WAC is used again on the seventh sol to acquire 12 RRGB images to increase the accuracy of the knowledge of rover positioning at the corners of the WISDOM pattern.\nNext, on the eighth sol while drilling to at least 1.5 m depth is proceeding, the WAC is used to acquire a further 10 RRGB images for strategic planning (e.g., to help determine the drive direction for the following EC). The final use of PanCam during the sampling phase is on the 10th sol to image the retrieved subsurface sample with the HRC (along with CLUPI) before ingestion into the ALD.\nBetween the 11th and 13th sols, PanCam rests while the ALD instruments analyze the subsurface sample. Then, from the 14th to 18th sol, the rover drives to the next EC location, while conducting WISDOM and ADRON soundings. The only PanCam activity on these sols is the possible acquisition of WAC broadband red filter stereo pairs (or mosaics of stereo pairs) to provide higher-resolution views (than available with the NavCams) to help plan the rovers' course to the next EC location.\nDuring the mission's two vertical surveys, the PanCam is mostly inactive while the rover drills at a single location. HRC images of the samples prior to ingestion can again be envisaged.\n4.2. Instrument performance examples\nThe instrument performance will be determined from the integrated PanCam instrument and from calibration when the instrument has been assembled (see Section 5.1–5.2). At present, representative examples have been produced by using PanCam emulators such as the AUPE-2 Aberystwyth University PanCam Emulator 2 (e.g., Pugh et al., 2012 ; Harris et al., 2015 ) and breadboard models, but the actual instrument performance examples are not available as yet.\nA number of ExoMars-related field trials and tests have been performed in the last few years (see Fig. 12 ), including participation in recent Arctic Mars Analogue Svalbard Expeditions (AMASE) 2008–2015 (see Schmitz et al., 2009 ; Steele et al., 2010 ), the SAFER campaign in the Atacama Desert in 2013 (Gunes-Lasnet et al., 2014 ), and field trials in Iceland in 2013 (Harris et al., 2015 ). For these tests, a representative PanCam simulator was used, which was provided by Aberystwyth University. This simulator includes representative (though not the final) filter wavelengths from which spectral information may be used to study mineralogy. These campaigns have been used, in combination with teams from other ExoMars instruments, to develop working procedures representative of a mission to Mars, as well as to test instrument performance, develop calibration techniques, and pursue scientific investigations of particular areas. These included, for example, the Bockfjord Volcanic Complex and the Nordaustlandet/Palander Icecap. Scientific data from these trials are discussed elsewhere (Schmitz et al., unpublished data).\nView larger version                                     (74K)\nFIG. 12.\nViews of AUPE PanCam simulator at tests in a Hertfordshire, UK, quarry (bottom left) and at the AMASE campaign, Svalbard.\nInformation about Downloading\nOther PanCam ground tests have included “blind” geological identifications performed in the AU Mars analog facility, tests in a quarry in Hertfordshire with the Astrium UK “Bridget” prototype rover, a field trial in Shropshire in 2015, and deployment in Boulby mine (Payler et al., 2017 ).\n5. Calibration and 3-D Vision\n5.1. Radiometric calibration plan\nRaw PanCam images will be processed to remove image artifacts caused by the camera system and convert digital numbers into calibrated radiometric values. These processing activities will be implemented in the PanCam data processing pipeline at the ROCC. To correct camera-induced image artifacts and obtain a true representation of the scene viewed by PanCam, radiometric calibration measurements to fully characterize the camera properties will be necessary.\nThe radiometric calibration of the PanCam instrument will comprise a combination of component- and system-level measurements to characterize the properties of various parts of the instrument. Component-level calibrations will measure camera properties including the following: detector dark current and bias, detector linearity, detector hot/cold pixels, filter absolute transmission, PCT reflectance, and so on. System level calibrations will characterize properties of the complete system and include the following: flat-field measurements to determine the non-uniformity in the response of the optical system, measurements of system radiometric response, measurements of system spectral response and the response of the system to stray light. Dark current and flat fields will also be acquired periodically in flight to determine the effects of thermal cycling and radiation exposure on the detector response.\nMany of the camera properties will be temperature-dependent, so calibration will be carried out as a function of temperature. The PanCam instrument together with calibration hardware, including an integrating sphere, will be mounted in a thermal vacuum chamber (TVC) at MSSL (see Fig. 13b ) so that measurements can be carried out over the full operating temperature range of the system: −50°C to 35°C. These measurements will be interpolated to the sensor temperature recorded for the in-flight images to allow the modeled sensor response to be subtracted and estimates of remaining errors to be derived (following the methods of Bell et al., 2006).\nView larger version                                     (56K)\nFIG. 13.\n(a) PanCam embedded in the Geometric transformations chain of the ExoMars rover. The main element is the rover frame with various elements attached such as Drill or WISDOM (bottom). The cascade relevant for PanCam is the transform between rover and PTU, followed by the transform between PTU and WACL—depending on the pan-tilt values. WACL, HRC, and WACR are described in the PanCam coordinate system. In addition, for fusion purposes PanCam (WACL) will be cross-calibrated with NavCam and ISEM. (b) MSSL TVC to be used for WACs/HRC calibration in open state. (c) PanCam geometric calibration target design with random dot pattern for WACs (large dots) and HRC (small dots).\nInformation about Downloading\nThe integrating sphere will be mounted on a linear translation stage so that it can be placed in front of each of the PanCam cameras without breaking vacuum. Light sources for the integrating sphere will include white light for flat-field and linearity measurements and a tunable light source incorporating a monochromator for spectral calibrations. The light sources and a calibrated monitor spectrometer will be located outside the TVC and coupled via optical fibers. PanCam calibration measurements will be traceable to national standards laboratories (NIST) via appropriate calibration standards. These will include a calibrated light source to achieve absolute radiometric calibration and reflectance standards to determine the absolute reflectance of the PCT.\n5.2. Geometric calibration plan\nThe geometric calibration of the PanCam involves all the steps required to define its components in a common coordinate system. This coordinate system will allow local reconstruction of the information collected by the PanCam components at each rover position on Mars.\nTo perform calibration, first each PanCam camera must be calibrated individually, second relative to each other, and then to the rest of the PanCam components. This last step is called cross-calibration.\nThe individual calibration of the WACs and HRC will compute the coordinates of the principal point, the focal length, and the lens distortion coefficients for each camera that is called intrinsic orientation (IO)—various representations are available. PanCam will use a derivative of the TSAI model (Tsai, 1987 ) with the option to convert to other well-known schemes such as CAHVOR (Di and Li, 2004 ). The IO of the WACs will be obtained by using one representative filter (e.g., the red RGB component); distortion of other filters is measured in comparison to it by measuring the relative distortion. For HRC IO, the calibration using two different focal lengths is needed. The cross-calibration determines the geometric relationship between all PanCam components, which are mathematically expressed as 3-D-Helmert transformations, as displayed in Fig. 13a .\nChanges in the IOs of the WACs and HRC will be observed by executing several temperature transitions in vacuum. Further exhaustive tests will be conducted in ambient conditions outside the TVC to assess the dependency of the filter wavelengths on the WAC IOs and the stability of the WAC and HRC IO and relative orientation after rotating the cameras around the Pan and Tilt Unit (PTU).\nThe original plan to bring a full setup of 3-D target points, measured by an optical coordinate metrology system (e.g., Vicon), into the calibration clean room was abandoned due to planetary protection and laboratory space reasons. Instead, a flat calibration target that fulfils the planetary protection requirements, that is, appropriate for dry heat microbial reduction, will be used. It consists of an aluminum target containing a set of randomly distributed points in different scales to fit the WAC and HRC needs simultaneously, as displayed in Fig. 13c . Furthermore, in contrast to up-to-date approaches of targets with regular patterns (Bell et al., 2003; Edgett et al., 2015 ), the target can cover the full image, and the points can still be automatically detected and correctly assigned to perform a fully automatic calibration using hundreds of images.\nThe final AIT task requires measurements of the relative calibration between the rover and OB, PTU, FidMs, and Mast. The current plan is to accomplish this by cross-calibration with NavCam and additional adjustment of the WACs versus the PTU axes by multiple overlapping image observations under varying PTU angles and overlapping observations of the rover deck and fiducial markers under varying PTU angles.\nCross-calibration with ISEM and CLUPI will be obtained by multiple simultaneous viewing of the same target (e.g., the PCT), followed by an adjustment procedure. Cross-calibration to WISDOM will be done only indirectly based on the PanCam and WISDOM individual alignment in the rover coordinate system.\nVerification and possible correction of the calibration on Mars will be obtained by bundle adjustment of single stereo pairs and overlapping patches of stereo panoramas.\n5.3. 3-D vision\nThree-dimensional scene reconstruction from PanCam stereo imagery is established by the processing framework PRoViP (Planetary Robotics Vision Processing). Starting with images from the instrument available via the ESA Planetary Science Archive or NASA Planetary Data System (during the mission the data will be directly from downlink sources in the ROCC), stereo matching is performed, followed by 3-D reconstruction into DTMs in various geometries, generation of an intermediate data set (“GPC”: Generic Point Cloud), combination of the DTMs into unique consistent mosaicked products, and finally the export into products to be exploited by scientists and operations personnel.\nExamples of processing products and capabilities are as follows:\n(a) Digital Elevation Models in spherical, cylindrical, and Cartesian coordinate space;\n(b) Ortho images;\n(c) 3-D meshes;\n(d) Derived thematic maps of the surroundings, describing reconstruction accuracy, occlusions, solar illumination, slopes, roughness, hazards, and so on;\n(e) Fusion of rover- and orbiter-based images;\n(f) Fusion between WAC and HRC 3-D vision data products (e.g., overlay of WAC DTM/ortho images with HRC texture).\nPRoViP has been extensively tested with various Mars mission data sets from sensors similar to PanCam, including MSL Mastcam (Barnes et al., 2015a , Paar et al., 2016a , 2016b ) (see Fig. 14 ).\nView larger version                                     (55K)\nFIG. 14.\n(Left) Result of MSL Mastcam processing of Garden City outcrop area taken at MSL Sol 926 and 929 (DTM, rendered by PRo3D) making use of ExoMars PanCam 3-D vision processing workflow scheme PRoViP. (Right) 3-D rendered MSL Mastcam stereo processing results at subcentimeter resolution, as appearing in PRo3D Graphical User Interface.\nInformation about Downloading\nFor immersive 3-D presentation of the PanCam 3-D vision products, we will use an interactive 3-D viewing tool called “PRo3D” (Planetary Robotics 3D Viewer, Barnes et al., 2015b ), which allows one to virtually explore reconstructed martian terrain and perform geological analysis ( Fig. 15 ). PRo3D builds upon the ideas of existing rendering tools used for tactical and strategic planning such as combining the rover CAD model with the 3-D reconstructed environment (Poulakis et al., 2008 ; Cooper et al., 2013 ; Proton, 2015 ) or the exploitation of image poses to generate virtual views (Howard, 2015 ). In addition, it goes beyond the approach of transition between panoramas and 3-D environment followed in Google Mars but gives simultaneous real-time access to different resolutions from planetary to microscopic level and therefore allows an interactive fusion of rover image products and orbiter DTMs (Paar et al., 2015 ), closing the loop between 3-D vision processing and immersive 3-D geology. Various measurement and annotation tools are provided to\n(a) Delineate geological boundaries,\n(b) Obtain the true dimension of geological features,\n(c) Obtain linear and projected distances between surface points,\n(d) Calculate dip and strike values of stratigraphic layers.\nView larger version                                     (85K)\nFIG. 15.\nScreenshot of PRo3D showing a geological interpretation session in the Shaler area (Gale Crater, MSL mission), based on PRoViP 3-D reconstruction from a set of 99 MSL Mastcam stereo images. This detailed interpretation of the stratigraphy shows the main stratigraphic boundaries as gray lines, bedset boundaries as thick white lines, and laminations within those bedsets as thin white lines (note that the original image is in color). The dip and strike values are available directly in PRo3D in color coded by dip value and generally dip 15–20° to the southeast (validation forthcoming). The findings are consistent with those in the works of Anderson et al. ( 2015 ) and Edgar et al. ( 2014 ) in that the outcrop represents a changing fluvial environment, with recessive, fine-grained units interlayered with coarse, pebbly units.

Developing such support must, at the very least, take account of the controller's traditional planning tool-the flight progress strip. Indeed, consideration of development policies of evolutionary change and greater automation suggests the need for an explicitly formulation of the design problem entailed by the use of flight progress strips for planning. The article reports research which aims to produce such a formulation. Specifically, it presents an analytic characterisation of the domain of air traffic management and illustrates the reconsideration of the flight progress strip facilitated by that characterisation.\nPublication data is maintained in RPS.

JENNINGS\nDepartment of Electronic Engineering, Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London, Mile End Road, London E1 4NS, UK\nReceived: 18 January 1993\nRevised: 18 August 1993\nSystems composed of multiple interacting problem solvers are becoming increasingly pervasive and have been championed in some quarters as the basis of the next generation of intelligent information systems. If this technology is to fulfill its true potential then it is important that the systems which are developed have a sound theoretical grounding. One aspect of this foundation, namely the model of collaborative problem solving, is examined in this paper. A synergistic review of existing models of cooperation is presented, their weaknesses are highlighted and a new model (called joint responsibility) is introduced. Joint responsibility is then used to specify a novel high-level agent architecture for cooperative problem solving in which the mentalistic notions of belief, desire, intention and joint intention play a central role in guiding an individual’s and the group’s problem solving behaviour. An implementation of this high-level architecture is then discussed and its utility is illustrated for the real-world domain of electricity transportation management.\nKeywords: Distributed artificial intelligence; multi-agent systems; BDI architecture; joint intentions; intentionality; rational problem solvers\nCited by (29):\nAnton A.

Yet as any new technology driverless vehicles carry with them many new risks and disadvantages that need to be understood and protected against in order for the introduction of said systems into the market place to be a long lasting and fruitful one.The present work will look at the possible safety and security risks posed by the use of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems on the open road, motivated by the fact that many projected autonomous vehicle concept systems rely on them for object detection and avoidance. Specifically the use or abuse of infrared laser technology will be analyzed for the potential risks it could pose in case of it were used to perpetrate an attack on the public by disguising an offensive system within the shell of a LiDAR-guided vehicular platform.The shape and possible mechanisms of such a threat will be elaborated upon and recommendations for their prevention will be proposed.\nEvent:\n""","0.31738585","""http://papers.sae.org/2015-01-0219/""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

Theoretical measures and issues connected with their estimation are described. Results are illustrated in the context of specific ecological questions about spatial patterns of trees in two forests.\n2The pair correlation function, related to Ripley's K function, provides a formal measure of the density of neighbouring plants and makes precise the general notion of a ‘plant's-eye’ view of a community. The pair correlation function can also be used to describe spatial relationships of neighbouring plants with different qualitative properties, such as species identity and size class.\n3The mark correlation function can be used to describe the spatial relationships of quantitative measures (e.g. biomass). We discuss two types of correlation function for quantitative marks. Applying these functions to the distribution of biomass in a temperate forest, it is shown that the spatial pattern of biomass is uncoupled from the spatial pattern of plant locations.\n4The inhomogeneous pair correlation function enables first-order heterogeneity in the environment to be removed from second-order spatial statistics. We illustrate this for a tree species in a forest of high topographic heterogeneity and show that spatial aggregation remains after allowing for spatial variation in density. An alternative method, the master function, takes a weighted average of homogeneous pair correlation functions computed in subareas; when applied to the same data and compared with the former method, the spatial aggregations are smaller in size.\n5Synthesis. These spatial statistics, especially those derived from pair densities, will help ecologists to extract important ecological information from intricate spatially correlated plants in populations and communities.\nReceived: 12 December 2008; accepted: 6 April 2009Handling Editor: Kyle Harms\nRelated content\nArticles related to the one you are viewing\nCiting Literature\nNumber of times cited: 128\n1\nEric Marcon, Florence Puech, A typology of distance-based measures of spatial concentration, Regional Science and Urban Economics, 2017, 62, 56\nCrossRef\n2\nJulia Chacón-Labella, Marcelino de la Cruz, Adrián Escudero, Lorena Gomez-Aparicio, Evidence for a stochastic geometry of biodiversity: the effects of species abundance, richness and intraspecific clustering, Journal of Ecology, 2017, 105, 2, 382\nWiley Online Library\n3\nHoujuan Song, Yudan Xu, Jing Hao, Bingqing Zhao, Donggang Guo, Hongbo Shao, Investigating distribution pattern of species in a warm-temperate conifer-broadleaved-mixed forest in China for sustainably utilizing forest and soils, Science of The Total Environment, 2017, 578, 81\nCrossRef\n5\nPavel Kukuliač, Jiří Horák, W Function: A New Distance-Based Measure of Spatial Distribution of Economic Activities, Geographical Analysis, 2017, 49, 2, 199\nWiley Online Library\n6\nPablo Ramón, Marcelino de la Cruz, Julia Chacón-Labella, Adrián Escudero, A new non-parametric method for analyzing replicated point patterns in ecology, Ecography, 2016, 39, 11, 1109\nWiley Online Library\n7\nEduardo Velázquez, Isabel Martínez, Stephan Getzin, Kirk A.

This rise in interest is due to the enormous requirements of multi-domain earthquake rescue, pollution monitoring, natural species discovery and other applications in which multi-modal locomotion can offer unprecedented advantages to robot mobility. Swimming, crawling, rolling, walking, running, jumping and flying are quite common in the animal kingdom, and such locomotion occurs in very different physical environments. Interestingly, an animal may perform two or more modes of locomotion. For instance, turtles and salamanders can swim underwater and walk on land, while swans can swim and fly effectively. Their often remarkable abilities could inspire innovative designs to improve the way man-made systems operate in and interact with challenging outdoor environments consisting of multiple media.\nModes of locomotion in nature can be decomposed broadly into three categories: terrestrial, aerial and aquatic. There are situations in which the distinction between categories is vague, such as movement on the surface of water or in underground tunneling. However, generally, the types of locomotion used by animals can be categorized into one of these three areas.\nThe primary venue of locomotion for many animals tends to be mono-modal; the majority of their task-space demands only a singular modality, with minimal need of alternative morphologies for transportation. The fundamental reason for multi-modal animal locomotion is for survival. The need for these multiple modes can arise from different requirements related to survival, including fast escape, fast pursuit, searching for food, breeding, nesting, conserving energy and migration.\nMost phylogenetic lineages of organisms are conservative in terms of habitat use, but some groups display major shifts in this trait. Some of the most spectacular examples of such phylogenetic shifts involve the invasion of aquatic (especially marine) habitats by terrestrial taxa. Because of the very different physical properties of air and water, selective pressures for effective locomotion can generate massive morphological divergences. Shine and Shetty [ 1 ] discussed the aquatic and terrestrial locomotion by studying the data gathered on speeds of sea kraits in water and on land. Multiple invasions of oceanic habitats by terrestrial organisms thus provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the process of adaptation in general and the nature and magnitude of trade-offs involved in adaptive transitions between alternative modes of locomotion. As pointed out by Shine et al [ 2 ], amphibious animals may be subjected to strong but conflicting selective pressures to enhance locomotor performance both on land and in water. Biomechanical models suggest that in snakes, adaptations to swimming (e.g. reduction of ventral plates, flattening of tail) will reduce their ability to move on land.\nIt is impossible to simultaneously optimize performance in two tasks that require mutually incompatible morphologies or physiologies. In addition, conflicting optima can occur for many kinds of traits, but the easiest to study are those in which performance can be easily quantified and optima can be easily identified. Thus, the most clear-cut examples of trade-offs in locomotor performance involve species that move in highly contrasting ways such as running versus flying or swimming. The results showed that locomotor speeds of amphibious sea snakes vary among specie, differ between the sexes within species and change with body sizes. A snake's species and sex also affect its relative speed in terrestrial versus aquatic locomotion. In the paper by Shine et al each of these effects was examined with the aim of evaluating conclusions and predictions from an earlier study [ 1 ].\nAs highlighted by Marlene [ 3 ], animals' kinematic changes between air and water can be understood in terms of the mechanical loads characteristic of these different fluid environments. The increased buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces in water compared to those on land can cause a shift in the predominant destabilizing forces an animal experiences. An animal using pedestrian locomotion under water must contend with hydrodynamic forces that can prevent it from locomoting quickly or that can cause it to overturn or wash away. In addition to an animal's morphology, factors such as posture, behavior and water flow environment dramatically influence the hydrodynamic forces the animal experiences.\nIn another study of an animal's multi-modal locomotion, Marlene measured hydrodynamic forces on the amphibious shore crab Grapsus tenuicrustatus in aquatic and terrestrial postures. The amphibious shore crab changes body posture as well as kinematics, using a different locomotory gait on land than in water [ 4 ]. The crabs walk on land at slow speeds, but in water at these same speeds, the crabs use a more variable gait (submerged punting), characterized by alternating thrust generation and gliding. Due to the lower hydrodynamic forces in the aquatic posture, a crab could move up to 50% more quickly than it could in the terrestrial posture or through a faster water flow environment [ 5 ]. Marlene also found that in slower flow environments, animals can move faster and take advantage of different gaits that are not available to them in faster flow environments.\nA brief survey on the recent application works of hybrid and multi-modal locomotion is presented in the following sections.\n2. Hybrid air-water mobility\nCurrent Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are greatly limited by being able to operate in air only, preventing them from moving effectively on the ground or in water. Developing robots with hybrid air-water mobility would address the need for remote water sampling in inaccessible areas during disasters. Of particularly high importance is the detection of chemicals and biological contaminations in the sea, in coastal regions or in urban areas where humans are in contact with water. This is of paramount interest in disaster scenarios such as flooding situations, after chemical or nuclear accidents and during oil spills. Recent examples, such as the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil spill in 2010 or the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011, show the urgent need for remote sensing capability in hazardous situations to better react to emergencies and coordinate manned interventions.\nWhile some UAVs can land on water, no technology is available that would allow them to both dive and fly due to dramatic design trade-offs that have to be solved for movement in both air and water and due to the absence of high-power propulsion systems that would allow a transition from underwater to air. However, in nature a variety of animals are able to move in both air and water such as diving birds, flying squid and jumping fish. In the following sections, existing concepts of air-water mobility in robotics will be reviewed, and a summary of the design principles for the next generation of flying robots with hybrid mobility capabilities will be provided.\n3. Air-Water mobility in robotics\nOne of the main challenges in the design of aerial-aquatic vehicles includes the design of the mission profile. A variety of approaches can be taken to achieve aerial water sampling (figure 1 ). For example, a water sampling probe can be descended from a hovering UAV (figure 1 (A)) or a simple floating UAV (figures 1 (B) and (C)) might be used to land on the water surface and take a water sample. However, these concepts are inherently limited by either very short flight times or susceptibility to surface movement and by waves that can be detrimental to the operation of the UAV. Other concepts include dropping an underwater vehicle from the UAV (figure 1 (D)) for single-use missions or using the propellers to move underwater (figure 1 (E)), although the propellers that are used for flight are not adapted for underwater operation due to the different fluid properties. Looking at nature, a variety of solutions for air-water mobility has evolved, with several animals executing a plunge dive maneuver, i.e. drop-diving from air to water and transitioning back to flight directly from under the water's surface. This approach of dynamic air-water-air locomotion (figure 1 (F)), although a technically challenging solution, is very promising for high-frequency water sampling in cluttered and unpredictable terrain, with a high robustness to water waves and an avoidance of floating obstacles that would prevent hydroplane style landing and take-off.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 1. Aerial water sampling can be performed with a variety of mission profiles: (A) a probe is descended from a hovering UAV, (B) hovering UAV lands on the water's surface and floats due to buoyancy, (C) hydroplane landing of a fixed wing UAV, (D) UAV drops an underwater vehicle from flight, (E) multi-copter using its propellers to dive underwater and (F) UAV using its flight momentum to dive and transition back to flight.

Novel robotic technologies, fluid structure interaction principles and control methods need to be developed to enable the implementation of AquaMAVs. In efforts toward implementing AquaMAVs, studies have been conducted on the implementation of plunge diving capability in a flying vehicle [ 5 – 7 ], and Liang et al [ 7 ] have developed a testing platform able to fold its wings before diving into the water. However, these systems are currently experimental platforms and are not able to fully transition between air and water.\nPropulsion in both air and water has been studied in [ 8 – 10 ] using a flapping wing approach for diving-bird-inspired flapping flight. Using a hydroplane style surface landing approach, many existing robotic aerial vehicles use the water's surface as an extended runway. While none of these robots are able to operate beneath the surface, some systems deploy underwater vehicles from the air but are usually reliant on single-use, disposable equipment such as parachutes, airbags and disposable wings. However, the existence of demand for air launched underwater vehicles [ 11 ] is important nonetheless, and several military programs have attempted to create manned submersible aircraft [ 12 , 13 ]. A fully integrated AquaMAV would have the ability to be launched from underwater from an autonomous surface vessel as well as from the air, offering added mission capability to existing unmanned vehicle frameworks.\nAlthough several different approaches have been taken in the design of an aerial-aquatic vehicle, a fully functional AquaMAV has yet to be presented. Inspiration from biology, in combination with the best of robotic engineering and a thorough understanding of the fluid dynamics involved in the process, will be a key to achieving this objective and developing this next generation of UAV.\n4. Design principles for effective air-water mobility\nIn the animal kingdom, the combination of aerial with underwater locomotion is very prevalent, with several species able to transition between the two medium very effectively. Examples include flying fish, flying squid, diving birds and diving insects (figure 2 ) [ 15 ]. We have summarised the advantages and limitations of several animals and robots with aerial-aquatic capabilities in table 1 [ 15 ].\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 2. Strategies for aerial-aquatic locomotion [ 15 ]: (A) two stage transition: Flying Fish, (B) Hydroplaning: Ducks, (C) Jet propulsion: Flying Squid, (D) Plunge diving: Northern Gannet, (E) Morphing wings: Common Guillemot, (F) Foot propulsion: Great Diving Beetle.

In this process of biological inspiration it is important to adopt only the principles and not copy the exact morphology of the animals. To this end, we adopt the Inspire-Abstract-Implement paradigm for bioinspired robot design (figure 3 ) [ 14 ] that outlines how the successful robots can be built based on principles from biology.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 3. Inspire-Abstract-Implement bioinspired design paradigm [ 14 ] in which the bioinspired design process can be separated in three distinctive phases which integrate the abstraction of biological design principles with modern engineering tools.

Based on the analysis in table 1 , the most important principles are: (i) using jet propulsion, (ii) employing a wing folding mechanism and (iii) performing a plunge diving approach for the transition from air to water by using the flight momentum to move underwater.\nThe main challenge for the propulsion unit is achieving the very high power density required for take-off. For example, flying fish reach a speed underwater of around 20 body lengths per second. This performance is one order of magnitude higher than what has been achieved with swimming robots so far [ 15 ]. Moreover, miniaturisation of the mechanism would make it very difficult to build a vehicle at a very small size that requires a propulsion choice that can be fabricated across the range of AquaMAV sizes. An alternative and easily scalable propulsion approach is offered by water jet propulsion. Using pre-charged or locally generated pressure, scalable mechanisms can be designed to eject water, allowing for thrust in both water and air. In the animal kingdom, water jet propulsion is used by flying squid that can range from several centimeters to several meters in size, proving the utility and effectiveness of the approach. The first robotic implementations of the high-power water jet propulsion mechanisms are presented in [ 15 , 16 ].\nMost animals have a folding wing mechanism that offers protection for their often fragile wing structures. Folding wings are also used by many birds to actively modulate the wing shape to initiate and guide dynamic flight behaviours. All aerial-aquatic animals use some kind of folding wings. Most notably, flying fish and flying squid use them to sustain lift in air while having them shaped differently in water for efficient swimming. Gannets also fold their wings to reduce the impact forces on their body when diving through the water's surface, allowing them to reach depths easily. For AquaMAVs, using folding wings is likely a preferred choice to protect the wings from mechanical damage on impact, to use the flight momentum to dive deeply without needing underwater buoyancy control and to potentially use the folding wings for efficient dynamics in both air and water.\nAerial-aquatic mobility is the next step for flying robots to enable applications such as water sampling, oil spill response and underwater inspection. The challenges that need to be addressed in the development of these AquaMAVs include propulsion methods and wing folding principles and their integration with novel control approaches for operation in both air and water. Building on principles found in nature by diving birds and flying sea animals, we can develop AquaMAVs and advance the fields of mobile robotics.\n5. Recent works on land-water locomotion\nIn the field of hybrid or multi-modal locomotion, biologists and robotists have collaborated and achieved meaningful results. On one hand, biological emulation and investigation have inspired engineers and have been fused into implementing novel mechanisms and/or improving pre-existing prototype performance [ 40 – 42 ]. On the other hand, robotic prototypes have been developed to understand hybrid locomotion principles [ 10 , 43 – 57 ]. Experimental observation on multi-modal locomotion is often limited to the behaviors voluntarily executed by amphibious animals. Moreover, the measurement of biomechanics and dynamics on free locomotion is also a challenging task.\nTypical cases of multi-modal locomotion include swimming robots with walking and/or flying abilities within amphibious behaviors. Low et al [ 43 ] proposed and developed swimming and crawling gait and action patterns of an amphibious land-water robot inspired by sea turtles, as depicted in figure 4 . Ijspeert et al [ 48 , 56 ] focused on using robotic models to understand behaviors of amphibious salamanders, as shown in figure 5 . The transition from aquatic to terrestrial locomotion was implemented and further understood using a neural central pattern generator (CPG) control scheme in the vertebrate multi-modal robotic prototype. Furthermore, a CPG control architecture was developed for controlling the hybrid locomotion of an amphibious snake/lamprey robot capable of swimming and serpentine locomotion. Yu et al [ 46 ] proposed and implemented a versatile amphibious robot, AmphiRobot-II, inspired by various amphibian principles in the animal kingdom. A novel hybrid propulsive mechanism coupled with wheel-propeller-fin movements was proposed that integrates fish- or dolphin-like swimming and wheel-based crawling. The robot is not only able to implement flexible wheel-based movements on land but is also able to perform steady and efficient fish- or dolphin-like swimming under water. Furthermore, it can switch between these two patterns via a specialized swivel device.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 4. Land-Water amphibian robot inspired by turtles [ 43 ]: (A) swimming and crawling turtles, (B) Crawling gait of a sea turtle, (C) Crawling gait of a turtle-inspired robot and (D) Swimming gait of a turtle-inspired robot.

Some of these robots achieve these tasks through multiple locomotion modes as shown by animals [ 49 , 56 , 58 , 59 ]. Multi-modal locomotion, particularly that of the multi-legged robotics, has recently gained increasing interest due to its ability to achieve natural interaction between the mechanical dynamics of the robot and the environment. Locomotion dynamics are the result of interactions between a particular internal control structure, the mechanical dynamics of the robot's body and the environment [ 60 , 61 ]. In addition to low-power systems and portability, which are vital challenges that substantially limit any successful biorobotic-based application, the proposed paradigms should also take into account issues related to scalability and security.\n6. Works related to air-ground locomotion\nIn nature, many animals that can fly can also move on ground effectively by either walking, crawling or jumping. Walking birds or insects are examples of this faculty, offering precise ground locomotion to the animal in addition to its flying capacity. There are some animals that use their ground mobility as a way to transition from ground to air, e.g. by jumping, which is then followed by gliding flight. Examples of such jump-gliding animals include gliding lizards, locusts, gliding geckos, gliding ants, spiders, gliding frogs, jumping bats, gliding mammals, gliding snakes and many birds (figure 6 ) [ 62 ]. Jumping and gliding can also be found amongst extinct species, such as the Sharovipteryx, and amongst some lizard-like reptiles with similar wings to that of the Draco lizard. Although all of these animals have very different body morphologies, they have converged in their evolution by adopting a hybrid jumping and gliding locomotion strategy. As the focus of this article is of a technological nature, the reader may refer to [ 63 – 65 ] for in-depth reviews of jump-gliding animals, with detailed descriptions of morphology and behavior.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 6. A selection of animals that use gliding as part of their locomotion strategy [ 62 ].

A related class of mobile robots includes propeller or flapping-wing-propelled vehicles that have added ground mobility [ 66 , 68 ] using legs or whegs (figures 7 (E) and (F)). These hybrid robots offer proof-of-concept implementation of multi-modal mobility for aerial vehicles, and they demonstrate the potential of combining ground and aerial locomotion. However, the field on multi-modal mobility is still at its early stages, and there are many unexplored avenues on how to combine aerial with ground and aquatic locomotion. Challenges include actuation, materials, propulsion, control and system integration. Thus, this field offers a wide range of possible research topics. Biological inspiration and creative design beyond the commonly employed airframes and control schemes will be a key in the development of these next-generation multi-modal robots.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 7. Air-Ground robots: (A) UC Berkeley Wing assisted running reproduced with permission from [ 68 ], (B) Stanford jumpglider reproduced with permission from [ 69 ], (C) EPFL jumpglider reproduced with permission from [ 70 ], (D) CMU MultiMo-Bat [ 70 ], (E) U.

Recent advances in biorobotics have helped bridge the gap between robotists and biologists; thus, recent mechatronic systems and robots are controlled in a way that reflects better understanding of complex living organisms.\nThe IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Technical Advisory Committee on BioRobotics organized a workshop on 'Biologically inspired based strategies for hybrid and multi-modal locomotion', in conjunction with the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) that was held at Tokyo Big Sight, Japan on November 3–7, 2013. The aim of the workshop was to explore and tackle the challenges of applying biologically-based concepts to robots in order to improve the robotic capabilities. The specific focus was on hybrid and multi-modal locomotion in air, water and/or on land.\nThe IROS 2013 Workshop consisted of four sessions: multi-modal ground robots, multi-modal locomotion dynamics, swimming and amphibian robots and multi-modal aerial robots. Four keynote speakers and several others were invited to present their work on the relevant fields. All scientists who presented their work at the workshop were invited to submit their work for review and possible publication in Bioinspiration & Biomimetics.\nIn this special issue, seven distinguished research teams with biology and engineering backgrounds present their ideas and works to fuse biological inspirations into robotic hybrid locomotion. Among the seven papers, one paper is concerned with the flapping wings inspired by bat and bird morphology, another paper focuses on a bioinspired underwater robot, four papers consider bioinspired land robots in different locomotion modalities and modes and one paper is devoted to the formulation schemes of bioinspired locomotion by virtue of multibody systems dynamics.\nIn the first paper, Stowers and Lentink present a new mechanism for passive wing morphing of flapping wings inspired by bats and birds. The mechanism consists of an unactuated hand wing connected to the arm wing with a wrist joint. To better understand the passive dynamics, a computer model of the unfolding process was constructed using rigid body dynamics, contact models and aerodynamic correlations. This model predicts the measured passive unfolding within about one flap and shows that unfolding is driven by centrifugal acceleration induced by flapping. These simulations indicate that unfolding is dominated by centrifugal accelerations induced by wing flapping rather than aerodynamic or gravitational forces. Finally, it is experimentally shown that passive unfolding wings can withstand impact with a branch by first folding and then unfolding passively. This mechanism enables flapping robots to squeeze through clutter without complex control. Experiments suggest that friction in the hinge should be minimized to the largest extent possible. The predicted unfold time based solely on centrifugal acceleration is on the order of one wingbeat and can be as short as half a wingbeat. This insight, corroborated from the theoretical, numerical and physical analysis of a flapping folding wing, provides new research avenues for the functional interpretation of the muscle groups that control vertebrate hand and arm wings.\nBioinspired sensing modalities enhance the ability of autonomous vehicles to characterize and respond to their environment. The paper by DeVries et al describes the design and implementation of a multi-modal artificial lateral line for flow sensing and feedback control of an underwater vehicle. By employing an artificial lateral line, the performance of underwater sensing and navigation strategies is improved in dark, cluttered or murky environments where traditional sensing modalities may be hindered. The estimation and control strategies enable an airfoil-shaped unmanned underwater vehicle to assimilate measurements from a bioinspired, multi-modal artificial lateral line and to estimate flow properties for feedback control. The robotic prototype outfitted with a multi-modal artificial lateral line composed of an ionic polymer metal composite and of embedded pressure sensors experimentally demonstrates the distributed flow sensing and closed-loop control strategies.\nInspired by observations from a biological runner, the paper by Park and Kim presents a bioinspired quadruped controller that allows variable-speed galloping. The developed controller estimates the required vertical impulse at each stride by applying the linear momentum conservation principle in the vertical direction and prescribes the ground reaction forces at each stride. Based on a biological observation, a new control design scheme is proposed for high-speed galloping in the MIT Cheetah 2 robot. Quadrupedal animals increase the vertical impulse that is generated by ground reaction forces at each stride as running speed increases and as the duration of each stance phase is reduced, whereas the swing phase stays relatively constant. Based on a biological observation, a new control design scheme is proposed for high-speed galloping in the MIT Cheetah 2 robot. A stable 3D galloping controller is currently applied to the MIT Cheetah 2 robot and will be implemented in indoor running of the robot.\nOne of the most significant challenges in bioinspired robotics is determining how to make use of multi-modal locomotion to help robots perform a variety of tasks adaptively in different environments. In order to address the challenge properly, it is important to understand that locomotion dynamics are the result of interactions between a particular internal control structure, the mechanical dynamics and the environment. The fourth paper by Nurzaman, Kim and Lida presents an approach to enable a robot to take advantage of its multiple locomotion modes by coupling the mechanical dynamics of the robot with an internal control structure known as an attractor selection model. The robot considered is a curved-beam hopping robot that possesses rich and complex mechanical dynamics that are dependent on its interactions with the environment. Through dynamical coupling, the robot performs goal-directed locomotion by gracefully shifting between different locomotion modes regulated by sensory input, the robot's mechanical dynamics and an internally generated perturbation. The coupling between the mechanical dynamics and the attractor selection mechanism enables the robot to take advantage of the different locomotion modes to bring itself toward the goal. The approach was also implemented in a real robot, enabling it to perform goal-directed locomotion based on the same principle.\nAnimals have demonstrated the ability to move through, across and over some of the most daunting environments on earth. This versatility and adaptability stems from their capacity to alter their locomotion dynamics and employ disparate locomotion modalities to suit various terrains. Dynamic climbing is commonly employed by legged animals, allowing for rapid and robust locomotion on vertical and near-vertical substrates. The paper by Miller et al presents a biologically-inspired model for dynamic climbing that captures the underlying pendular motion observed in studies of cockroaches and geckos running on vertical surfaces. This model was inspired from observations of similar gait characteristics in the dynamics of rapidly climbing cockroaches and geckos. This paper investigated several of these factors and proposed policies and methodologies to improve performance and reliability on both dedicated climbers and multi-modal systems.\nRecent works suggest that jumping locomotion in combination with a gliding phase can be used as an effective mobility principle in robotics. The paper by Vidyasagar et al evaluated the performance of jump-gliding locomotion and provides models for the relevant dynamics of flight. It also defines a jump-gliding envelope that encompasses the range that can be achieved with jump-gliding mobility and that can then be used to evaluate the performance and improvement potential of jump-gliding robots. In order to validate the prediction of these models, a jump-gliding robot, named the 'EPFL jump-glider', has been tested in experiments to perform jumps from elevated positions, to perform steered gliding flight, to land safely from considerable heights and to move on ground by repetitive jumping.\nThe last article of the special issue by Boyer and Porez developed a set of generic tools for multibody systems dynamics devoted to the study of bioinspired locomotion in robotics. In considering a general problem of locomotion, they progressively drew a unified geometric picture of locomotion dynamics, starting from the model of discrete mobile multibody systems, followed by the case of continuous and finally soft systems. Starting from animals before moving on to robots, it is shown that there is a need to develop methodological tools for designing, modeling, control and motion planning of a new generation of robots with multi-degrees of freedom. The paper also addresses the practical problem of the efficient computation of these models by proposing a Newton-Euler-based approach to efficient locomotion dynamics, with a few illustrations of creeping, swimming and flying. The authors discovered that behind their apparent diversity, many locomotion modes share common geometric structures.\n8. Concluding remarks\nAs discussed in this article and covered by the papers in this special issue, various modes of locomotion that can be adopted by different genus groups in multiple media are investigated to understand the compromise in ability adopted by the animals when achieving multi-modal locomotion.\nConsidering all of the natural examples shown for aerial, aquatic and/or terrestrial operations, it would appear that using distinct locomotive mechanisms for multi-modal operations of this type is advantageous. This is true for both birds and insects, with birds having the advantage of higher feasible scalability of functions. More experimental works would be required to determine if the terrestrial ability has led to a decrease in aerial ability within a specific species.\nMany different types of locomotion are used across the biological classes, but it should be noted that each has a varying level of competence within the substrate, and as such, careful consideration must be given before assuming that mimicking the animal's techniques will provide the most suitable combination for real-world engineering problems [ 40 , 48 , 60 , 72 – 74 ].\nIn the near future, much closer biologist-and-robotist collaboration will still be an important step for developing multi-modal locomotion. More innovative biorobots are to be developed to emulate and investigate hybrid locomotion since man-made prototypes outperform repetitive behaviors and influential factor isolation when compared to animals. Biomechanics on transition among jumping, walking, running, rolling, crawling, swimming and/or flying should be focused on. Agile movements of animals should be further understood in principles of their central and peripheral nervous systems as well as their musculoskeletal system. Certainly, their adaptation to varying environments is also a really interesting and inspiring component. Furthermore, inspiration from emulating or understanding multi-modal locomotion should promote robotics performance and enable more practical applications. Smart materials, flexible mechanisms and advanced control strategies are essential to realize the enormous potentials in industrial, educational, common-health, security-related, home-service and special fields of robotics.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank the authors for their exciting contributions to this special issue.

These smart devices and sensors will be found in our homes, our cars, our workplaces, etc., and have the potential to revolutionise how we interact with the world today. The slew of data generated by such a volume of devices necessitates the use of smart, autonomous machine-to-machine (M2M) communications; however, this necessarily poses serious security and privacy issues as we will no longer have direct control over with whom and what our devices communicate. This could potentially open up new attack vectors for criminal hackers to exploit through the use of malicious or tampered IoT devices. Compounding the problem is that to enable the ubiquitous nature of the IoT, the embedded devices themselves are often low-cost, low-power, throwaway units which are restricted both in memory and computing power. Generally, low-cost devices targeted at the IoT space, such as the ARM Cortex-M® or the Atmel tinyAVR® families of microcontroller units (MCUs), contain little if any embedded security features. Their lightweight nature is such that even highly optimised cryptographic implementations targeted at specific MCU still require a significant timing, and corresponding energy, overhead [9]. Hence, it is clear we need a new approach to securing the IoT. In this chapter, we outline the proposed use of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for the provision of IoT device security.\nDOI\nResearch output: Chapter in Book/Report/Conference proceeding › Conference contribution\nFingerprint\nT: +44 (0)28 9024 5133\nEmergency T: +44 (0)28 9097 2222\n© Queen's University Belfast 2017,\n""","2.2379003","""http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/lightweight-cryptographic-identity-solutions-for-the-internet-of-things(2b0cefcc-c4c2-411c-9b2a-b7cf1e161eed).html""","[-5.934759,54.583863]"

The 130-Mb Blumeria genome encodes approximately 540 predicted effectors that are hypothesized to suppress or induce host processes to promote colonization. Blumeria effector candidate (BEC)1019, a single-copy gene encoding a putative, secreted metalloprotease, is expressed in haustorial feeding structures, and host-induced gene silencing of BEC1019 restricts haustorial development in compatible interactions. Here, we show that Barley stripe mosaic virus–induced gene silencing of BEC1019 significantly reduces fungal colonization of barley epidermal cells, demonstrating that BEC1019 plays a central role in virulence. In addition, delivery of BEC1019 to the host cytoplasm via Xanthomonas type III secretion suppresses cultivar nonspecific hypersensitive reaction (HR) induced by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola, as well as cultivar-specific HR induced by AvrPphB from Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. BEC1019 homologs are present in 96 of 241 sequenced fungal genomes, including plant pathogens, human pathogens, and free-living nonpathogens. Comparative analysis revealed variation at several amino acid positions that correlate with fungal lifestyle and several highly conserved, noncorrelated motifs. Site-directed mutagenesis of one of these, ETVIC, compromises the HR-suppressing activity of BEC1019. We postulate that BEC1019 represents an ancient, broadly important fungal protein family, members of which have evolved to function as effectors in plant and animal hosts.\nObligate fungal pathogens, i.e., pathogens that require their host to survive, are a major threat to crop production worldwide. Effector proteins secreted by these pathogens inhibit or accelerate host processes to co-opt the host cellular environment for nutrient acquisition and colonization. The interaction of barley, Hordeum vulgare L., with the powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei is an ideal model to explore the molecular mechanisms by which effectors manipulate these processes. After a conidiospore lands on the leaf surface, an appressorium develops, from which a hyphal peg penetrates the cuticle and the epidermal cell wall. Here, the pathogen forms its feeding structure, the haustorium, surrounded by a perihaustorial membrane that is continuous with but distinct from the plasma membrane of the epidermal cell ( Dörmann et al. 2014 ). Using nutrients obtained from the host, secondary hyphae on the leaf surface infect additional epidermal cells. Infection of epidermal cells by B. graminis is hypothesized to involve delivery of secreted effectors into the host to suppress defense. Genomic and proteomic studies have identified about 540 Blumeria effector candidates (BEC) or candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEP) ( Bindschedler et al. 2011 ; Kusch et al. 2014 ; Pedersen et al. 2012 ; Spanu et al. 2010 ). A small number of these have been characterized ( Ahmed et al. 2015 ; Pliego et al. 2013 ; Schmidt et al. 2014 ; Zhang et al. 2012 ), but the molecular mechanisms by which effectors manipulate host processes to promote colonization are still poorly understood.\nThe plant defense response includes two interdependent pathways, pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) ( Bent and Mackey 2007 ; Macho and Zipfel 2014 ). PAMPs are recognized by host transmembrane recognition receptors that then signal, at least in part, through a downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade ( Boller and Felix 2009 ; Boller and He 2009 ). ETI is mediated by host resistance (R) genes, which often encode cytoplasmic nucleotide binding-leucine rich repeat (NLR) proteins ( Bent and Mackey 2007 ; Cesari et al. 2014 ; Jacob et al. 2013 ). The direct or indirect interaction between an effector and an NLR protein results in resistance, usually associated with a hypersensitive reaction (HR), defined in this study as a rapid cell death at the infection site. In order to survive, pathogens have evolved or acquired effectors that suppress these defense responses ( Boller and Felix 2009 ; Boller and He 2009 ; Kjemtrup et al. 2000 ; Stergiopoulos and de Wit 2009 ).\nWe previously screened 50 selected BEC genes by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) ( Nowara et al. 2010 ) and found eight that are important for haustorial development ( Pliego et al. 2013 ). Some of these genes encode proteins unique to powdery mildews, while others show varying degrees of conservation across fungal taxa. Characterization of effectors exclusive to the mildews has the potential to shed light on the nature of obligate biotrophy. Alternatively, effectors that are broadly conserved may reveal plant defense gene targets that could be exploited to engineer resistance to a spectrum of fungal pathogens. The focus of this study is BEC1019 (GenBank KJ571201) ( Bindschedler et al. 2011 ), which is conserved across a broad range of fungal taxa. We found that Barley stripe mosaic virus–induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) of BEC1019 significantly reduced the accumulation of fungal hyphae on the surface of barley leaves, revealing a central role for BEC1019 in virulence and colonization. In addition, Xanthomonas type III secretion (T3S)-based delivery of BEC1019 suppressed both cultivar-nonspecific HR induced by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola and cultivar-specific HR induced by the AvrPphB effector from Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola ( Ade et al. 2007 ; DeYoung et al. 2012 ; Shao et al. 2003 ). Moreover, homologs of BEC1019 are conserved in more than 90 fungal taxa. Site-directed mutagenesis of BEC1019 revealed a conserved ETVIC motif to be required for suppression of HR. We conclude that this widely distributed protein has evolved to play a key role in the survival and reproduction of the obligate biotrophic fungus B. graminis by suppressing host defense.\nRESULTS\nSection:\nBSMV-VIGS of BEC1019 impedes fungal growth in incompatible interaction\nSilencing B. graminis effectors should alter the ability of the fungus to infect and colonize barley. Indeed, when BEC1019 is subjected to single cell HIGS ( Nowara et al. 2010 ), B. graminis develops significantly fewer haustoria compared with a control interaction ( Pliego et al. 2013 ). To extend these single-cell results to whole leaves, we adopted our bombardment-based BSMV-VIGS system, a systemic transient gene-silencing assay that enables quantification of fungal growth ( Meng and Wise 2012 ; Meng et al. 2009 ). A 264-nucleotide region from the middle of the BEC1019 coding sequence was inserted into the BSMV:γ genome to create the silencing construct, designated BSMV:1019368-632. The wild-type BSMV:γ was used as a negative control, designated BSMV:00. First leaves from 7-day-old barley cv. HOR11358 (Mla9) plants were mechanically inoculated with sap from leaves previously bombarded with these constructs (discussed below), and after 12 days, plants that displayed BSMV symptoms were inoculated with the compatible B. graminis f. sp. hordei isolate 5874 (avra9). Seven days later, third leaves were assessed for fungal growth and were imaged ( Fig. 1A ). The experiment was conducted in four independent biological replications of eight to ten plants per treatment, resulting in a total of 32 individual leaves scored per treatment.\nDownload figure as PPT\nFig. 1.\nBarley stripe mosaic virus–induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) of BEC1019 reduces hyphal fungal growth and conidiation. A, Leaves from barley cultivar HOR 11358 (Mla9) treated with the BSMV:1019368-632 construct, with BSMV:00 (empty vector), or subjected to mock viral inoculation (Carborundum buffer), photographed 7 days following inoculation with compatible Blumeria graminis isolate 5874 (avra9). Each construct was used in four replicate experiments, with eight to ten plants per treatment, and each replicate yielded similar results. B, To quantify fungal growth, the image shown in A was grayscaled, using LeafQuant-VIGS. B. graminis is white, thus the extent of discoloration is used to quantify fungal biomass on the otherwise green leaf. LeafQuant (LQ) output is presented as percent infection above each leaf. C, B. graminis BEC1019 gene (top) and cDNA (middle), showing positions of primers for BSMV-VIGS and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. D, B. graminis hyphal growth as a function of BEC1019 expression. Data points represent log2 relative expression in the third leaf of each of the 32 plants that were treated with the BSMV:1019368-632 construct over the four replications. Target gene expression was calculated using the 2-∆CT method in individual BSMV:1019368-632-treated and BSMV:00-treated plants (Schmittgen and Livak 2008). B. graminis β-tubulin was used as a steady state control. Magenta-filled circles correspond to a subsample from leaves 1, 3, 4, and 5 in panel A (leaf 2 was not assayed due to poor RNA quality). BSMV:1019368-632-treated leaves with relative BEC1019 expression <1 (filled circles to the left of the middle line) have significantly lower average percent infection (P value = 0.0019) than BSMV:1019368-632-treated leaves with relative BEC1019 expression >1 (open circles to the right of the middle line). E, Relative expression of six B. graminis genes in BSMV:00 versus BSMV:1019368-632-treated leaves. Fold change was calculated by dividing the expression mean value for the targeted gene in BEC1019-silenced plants by the mean value measured in BSMV:00-treated plants.\nTo quantify hyphal growth on the surface of epidermal cells, we developed a MATLAB image processing software program, designated LeafQuant-VIGS (discussed in Materials and Methods). Starting with high-resolution RGB images of each leaf, LeafQuant first defines the edges, then detects the background and converts it to uniformly true black, and subsequently, converts the high-resolution color RGB image to an 8-bit grayscale image with 256 shades of gray ( Fig. 1B ). Because elongating secondary hyphae, an indicator of functional haustoria ( Ellingboe 1972 ), are white and the barley leaf is green, these contrasts can be used to quantify fungal growth.\nTreatment with the VIGS construct BSMV:1019368-632 resulted in significantly less fungal growth compared with BSMV:00 and mock treatments ( Fig. 1A and B ). We tested if silencing of BEC1019 was correlated to this reduced fungal growth by plotting real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) log2 relative expression levels from the 32 individual leaves treated with BSMV:1019368-632 against the percent infection output from LeafQuant-VIGS for those leaves ( Fig. 1D ). We then conducted four linear mixed model analyses (discussed below), showing that, whenever BEC1019 was successfully silenced, there was less hyphal growth on epidermal cells (P = 0.0019) ( Fig. 1B and D ), indicating an essential role for BEC1019 in the ability of the pathogen to colonize its host.\nAs an independent measure of fungal growth, we also carried out qRT-PCR for four B. graminis transcripts that are not significantly differentially expressed during development, based on surveys of publicly available RNA-Seq data ( Hacquard et al. 2013 ) and two others that represent alternative isoforms encoding chitin, a fungal cell-wall component ( Ayliffe et al. 2013 ). For this experiment, we used RNA from the third leaf of three BSMV:1019-silenced plants and three BSMV:00-treated plants that showed low and high amounts, respectively, of fungal growth, as determined by LeafQuant-VIGS. Each of the six transcripts was less abundant in the (BEC1019-silenced) leaves with low amounts of fungal growth than in the (BSMV:00 treated) leaves with high amounts of fungal growth ( Fig. 1E ; Supplementary Table S4), corroborating the LeafQuant-VIGS results.\nBEC1019 suppresses barley HR caused by X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256.\nWe expect that bona fide effectors should be able to induce or suppress HR in barley. Assaying individual B. graminis effectors has been difficult, due to the obligate biotrophic nature of this pathogen and the lack of a robust transformation protocol ( Pliego et al. 2013 ). To overcome these obstacles, we adapted the bacterial T3S system to deliver heterologous effector candidates into barley cells. Pseudomonas spp. have been used as a delivery vehicle in Arabidopsis thaliana to characterize oomycete effector proteins by fusion to the type III signals of avirulence proteins AvrRps4 and AvrRpm1 ( Rentel et al. 2008 ; Sohn et al. 2007 ); this system was also recently used in wheat to investigate effector candidates from the stem rust fungus Puccinia graminis tritici ( Upadhyaya et al. 2014 ). Additionally, Sharma and colleagues (2013) have employed the Burkholderia glumae T3S system to transfer Magnaporthe oryzae effectors to rice cells.\nFor our purposes, we selected X. campestris pv. raphani 756C ( Kamoun et al. 1992 ), which causes bacterial spot of brassicas, and X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256, which causes bacterial leaf streak of rice. When syringe-infiltrated into barley leaves, strain 756C elicits no visible response, while strain BLS256 elicits an HR. Therefore, these bacterial strains offer the opportunity, individually or in combination, to screen for HR-eliciting or HR-suppressing effectors. In searching for HR suppressors, coinfiltration of strain 756C delivering a test effector with strain BLS256 as elicitor or with strain 756C delivering a distinct HR inducer allows titration of the relative amounts to screen for quantitative effects ( Makino et al. 2006 ). To assess the degree of HR to infiltrated bacterial strains, we developed a second MATLAB image-processing program, LeafQuant-T3S (discussed below).\nThe coding sequence for BEC1019 without its predicted signal peptide was fused to the 3′ end of the sequence encoding the T3S signal of AvrBs2 from X. campestris pv. vesicatoria ( Minsavage et al. 1990 ; Mudgett et al. 2000 ) by cloning into a new broad-host range expression vector, pYM5. When infiltrated into barley leaves, neither X. campestris pv. raphani 756C expressing the AvrBs2 T3S signal terminated by a stop codon (AvrBs2’) nor the BEC1019 fusion (AvrBs2’:BEC1019) elicited a visible response, identical to untransformed X. campestris pv. raphani 756C ( Fig. 2 ; Table 1 ). X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256 transformed with the AvrBs2’:BEC1019 construct retained the ability of the untransformed strain to elicit HR in barley (not shown). To account for the possibility that any suppressor function of BEC1019 is quantitative, we carried out titrated coinoculations as alluded to above, using X. campestris pv. raphani 756C to deliver the AvrBs2’:BEC1019 fusion and untransformed X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256 as the elicitor. At a strain 756C to strain BLS256 ratio of 16:1, the HR normally elicited by X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256 at that titer was suppressed ( Fig. 2 ; Table 1 ). This suppressive effect was attributable to BEC1019, as neither AvrBs2’ alone nor another B. graminis effector (BEC1038) expressed in the same way in X. campestris pv. raphani 756C suppressed the BLS256-elicited HR ( Fig. 2 ; Table 1 ; Supplementary Fig. S1). Finally, the effect depended on an intact X. campestris pv. raphani 756C T3S system, as it was lost when AvrBs2’:BEC1019 was expressed from the T3S-deficient strain 756C derivative HW9 (T3S–) ( Fig. 2 ; Table 1 ).\nDownload figure as PPT\nFig. 2.\nBEC1019 delivered via the Xanthomonas type III secretion (T3S) system suppresses hypersensitive reaction (HR) elicited by X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256 (Xoc) in barley. A, Primary leaves of barley line CI 16151 (Mla6) seedlings photographed 5 days after syringe infiltration with a mixed suspension of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256 cells and cells of X.campestris pv. raphani 736C or its T3S-deficient derivative HW9 (Xcr and Xcr T3S–, respectively) expressing the indicated protein constructs (in parentheses).

AvrBs2’ was expressed from pYMAJ1 and AvrBs2’:BEC1019 from pYM5. X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256 alone elicits HR and X. campestris pv. raphani 756C alone elicits no symptom (not shown). In each treatment, a cell suspension of the X.campestris pv. raphani 756C strain at an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.8 was mixed 1:1 (by volume) with a cell suspension of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256 at OD600 of 0.05 for a 16:1 final cell ratio (OD600 of 0.4 for X. campestris pv. raphani 756C and 0.025 for X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256). Leaves were infiltrated when seedlings were 10 days old and the infiltrated area was delineated using a permanent marker. B, A dot plot showing the extent of HR (necrosis) resulting from each of the three infiltrations (top, middle, and bottom) in each leaf, aligned under the image of that leaf in A.

The triple asterisk indicates P < 0.001 for the difference between AvrBs2’ and AvrBs2’:BEC1019 delivered by wild-type X. campestris pv. raphani 756C as well as the difference between AvrBs2’:BEC1019 delivered by the wild type versus the T3S− mutant. The experiment was repeated twice and each replicate showed the same result. The HR elicited by X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256 in barley is cultivar nonspecific.\nTable 1.\nMixed linear model analysis of BEC1019 effect on Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola–elicited hypersensitive responsea\nTo determine whether BEC1019 promotes bacterial population growth in these nonhost interactions, bacteria were quantified immediately and at 3 and 6 days after infiltration by dilution plating of ground leaf segments. As shown in Table 2 , populations of X. campestris pv. raphani 756C expressing AvrBs2’ infiltrated alone remained steady throughout the experiment, while populations of that strain with coinfiltrated X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256 declined tenfold, as expected for nonhost interactions without or with HR, respectively ( Alfano and Collmer 1996 ). X. campestris pv. raphani 756C expressing AvrBs2’:BEC1019 infiltrated alone showed no significant change in population size over time. In the coinfiltration with X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256 however, BEC1019 prevented the drop in bacterial population size that occurred coincident with the HR when BEC1019 was not present. Thus, overall, the bacterial population data revealed no general bacterial growth promoting effect of BEC1019 in barley; however, the observed persistence of otherwise HR-inducing, nonhost bacterial populations in the presence of BEC1019 corroborates the role of BEC1019 as a defense suppressor.\nTable 2.\nMixed linear model analysis of the effect of BEC1019 on populations of Xanthomonas spp. in infiltrated barley leavesa\nBEC1019 suppresses HR elicited by AvrPphB, a cysteine protease effector from Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola.\nHaving found that BEC1019 suppresses cultivar-nonspecific HR induced by X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256 in barley, we sought to further probe its function by asking whether it would suppress a cultivar-specific HR elicited by a characterized effector. We, thus, screened a collection of 73 diverse barley lines for HR to X. campestris pv. raphani 756C expressing the Pseudomonas syringae cysteine protease effector AvrPphB ( Shao et al. 2003 ; Zhang et al. 2010 ). We selected this effector because it is known to target a protein kinase (PBS1) in Arabidopsis that is conserved across many flowering plant species ( Caldwell and Michelmore 2009 ; Shao et al. 2003 ), including barley (GenBank accession number AK368943). In Arabidopsis, cleavage of PBS1 by AvrPphB activates the NLR protein RPS5, which results in the HR ( Ade et al. 2007 ; Qi et al. 2012 ; Shao et al. 2003 ; Simonich and Innes 1995 ). Given that PBS1 is highly conserved, it seemed plausible that barley might also have an R protein analogous to RPS5 to monitor cleavage of the kinase. Indeed, our screen identified four lines (Diamond from Canada, Hv531 from Switzerland, PI452421 from the U. K., and WBDC 209 from Uzbekistan) that exhibited a HR specifically to X. campestris pv. raphani 756C expressing AvrPphB (Supplementary Fig. S2; Supplementary Table S1).\nHence, although AvrPphB is recognized by multiple dicot species, including common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) ( Jenner et al. 1991 ), pea (Pisum sativum) ( Fillingham et al. 1992 ), and Arabidopsis ( Simonich and Innes 1995 ), the results of this screen represent the first indication that it is recognized in monocots as well. Moreover, to our knowledge, AvrPphB is one of the few effectors known to trigger HR in both dicots and monocots.\nGiven the conservation of PBS1 in barley, the HR of the four lines to AvrPphB is consistent with the presence of a NLR protein that recognizes cleavage of the barley PBS1 by AvrPphB. More importantly for this study, these lines enabled us to assay the ability of BEC1019 to suppress the HR elicited by an effector known to be involved in ETI ( Ade et al. 2007 ; Shao et al. 2003 ). We tested suppression by coinfiltrating X. campestris pv. raphani 756C expressing AvrBs2’:BEC1019 with 756C expressing AvrPphB, at a ratio of 8:1. In each of the four lines that showed HR in response to AvrPphB, AvrBs2’:BEC1019 but not AvrBs2’ alone suppressed that response ( Fig. 3 ; Table 3 ).\nDownload figure as PPT\nFig. 3.\nBEC1019 delivered via the Xanthomonas type III secretion (T3S) system suppresses a cultivar-specific barley hypersensitive reaction (HR) triggered by the cysteine protease effector AvrPphB from Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. A, Primary syringe-infiltrated leaves of barley cv. Diamond. X. campestris pv. raphani 756C (Xcr) (AvrBs2’), included as a reference for no HR, was infiltrated at an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.4, and AvrPphB was infiltrated at an OD600 of 0.05. For the mixed suspension, AvrBs2’:BEC1019 and AvrPphB were suspended at OD600 of 0.8 and 0.1, respectively, and then, were mixed 1:1 (by volume) prior to infiltration. AvrPphB was expressed from a clone with its native promoter in plasmid pVSP61, which has the same backbone as pYM5 and pYMAJ1 but lacks the AvrBs2’ fusion and the lac promoter.

The triple asterisk indicates P < 0.001 for the difference between AvrBs2’ and AvrPphB, as well as the difference between AvrPphB and (AvrPphB + AvrBs2’:BEC1019). The experiment was repeated twice and each replicate showed the same result.\nTable 3.\nMixed linear model analysis of BEC1019 effect on AvrPphB-elicited hypersensitive response in different in diverse barley linesa\nBEC1019 is broadly conserved.\nThe functional assays presented above indicate that BEC1019 plays a key role in colonization of barley by B. graminis f. sp. hordei, ostensibly by suppressing host defense. Thus, we sought to establish how widely distributed this protein is across diverse fungi. A BLASTp search of the BEC1019 amino acid sequence against the annotated proteins of 240 fungal genome sequences as of September 2013 from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nonredundant database ( Johnson et al. 2008 ), the Fungal Genome Initiative (Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT), and the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute ( Grigoriev et al. 2012 ) returned sequences from 96 species with an E value less than 1e−15, in addition to BEC1019 itself (Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Fig. S3). These include homologs from every major fungal taxon in which at least five genomes have been sequenced. Individual species include plant pathogens and animal pathogens and one symbiont (a lichen) but also free-living fungi. We submitted each of the homologs to OrthoMCL using Protocol 1 ( Chen et al. 2006 ), and it placed 96 of the 97 in one ortholog group, OG5_142791. InterProScan also assigned the 96 in OG5_142791 to the same superfamily, SSF55486 (a metalloprotease “zincin” catalytic domain superfamily), and protein family, PFAM ID PF13933 (a putative peptidase family).\nSubsequently, the default settings of MegAlign were used to generate a similarity tree of the 96 sequences in OG5_142791 ( Fig. 4 ). Several major plant pathogens are found on the tree, including those that cause rice blast (M. oryzae), tan spot (Pyrenophora tritici-repentis), Stagonospora nodorum blotch of wheat, and northern and southern leaf blight of maize (Setosphaeria turcica and Cochliobolus heterostrophus, respectively). Several Fusarium species are also observed, including causal agents of Fusarium head blight of barley and wheat (F. graminearum), and sudden death syndrome (F. virguliforme) of soybean. Among the BEC1019 homologs from animal pathogens and free-living fungi are the characterized proteins Pra1 from Candida albicans ( Citiulo et al. 2012 ), major allergen Asp F2 from Aspergillus fumigatus ( Amich et al. 2010 ), and Zps1 ( Lamb et al. 2001 ) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As of January 23, 2014, no hits were obtained from tBLASTn searches of BEC1019 in the sequences of the basidiomycete obligate biotrophs Puccinia graminis, P. striiformis, and P. recondita, however, a homolog was found in the basidiomycete corn smut pathogen, Ustilago maydis.\nDownload figure as PPT\nFig. 5.\nPartial sequence logo for BEC1019 and homologs showing relative conservation of residues at different positions (corresponding to the height of the individual letters, codes for individual amino acids). The logo was generated using WebLogo and is based on the multiple sequence alignment generated using MegAlign. The ETVIC and HRxxH motifs are annotated with their positions in the BEC1019 sequence. Dotted lines indicate predicted disulfide bonds between cysteine residues, according to DISULFIND.\nThe conserved ETVIC motif is required for suppression of HR.\nEight conserved cysteine residues are predicted by DISULFIND ( Ceroni et al. 2006 ) to form four disulfide bonds ( Fig. 5 ). Four of the cysteines are present in three of the seven motifs. To assess whether these conserved cysteine residues, other residues in the ETVIC motif, or residues in the HRxxH motif are required for function, we performed site-directed mutagenesis and screened the resulting constructs (Supplementary Table 3) for loss of HR-suppressing activity in the T3S assay with X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256 as elicitor ( Fig. 6 ; Table 4 ). Substitution C152S in the ETVIC motif resulted in a decreased ability to suppress HR. Consistent with this result, bacterial populations dropped to the same extent seen in leaves infiltrated with X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256 and the X. campestris pv. raphani 756C control expressing AvrBs2’ ( Table 2 ). Significantly, substitution at none of the other cysteine residues affected function, suggesting that none participates in a disulfide bond or that such bonds are not essential to BEC1019 HR suppression activity and, therefore, that the C152S effect is specific and not the result of general destabilization of the protein. Furthermore, two other substitutions in the ETVIC motif, V150A and I151A, like C152S, displayed a significant reduction in HR-suppressing activity ( Table 4 ), supporting a specific functional role for C152 and the motif overall. Notably, none of the mutations in the highly conserved HRxxH motif altered HR suppression in this assay. Comparable stability of wild-type BEC1019 and the ETVIC and HRxxH mutant proteins were confirmed by Western blot analysis using epitope-tagged constructs (Supplementary Fig. S5).\nDownload figure as PPT\nFig. 6.\nMutations within the ETVIC but not the HRxxH motif affect the HR suppressive function of BEC1019 delivered via the Xanthomonas type III secretion (T3S) system.

To investigate, we generated a random forest of classification trees ( Breiman 2001a ). Training data for construction of the random forest consisted of the fungal lifestyle (plant pathogen, animal pathogen, or free-living nonpathogen) and the residue at each position in the MSA for each of the 96 (OG5_142791) homologs. Each of 10,000 classification trees included in the forest was constructed from a bootstrap sample of the 96 sequences and produces a lifestyle prediction for any given fungus as a function of MSA residues.\nTo identify the MSA positions most associated with fungal lifestyle, we conducted a variable importance (VI) analysis as proposed by Breiman (2001b) . For the analysis considered here, the importance of any particular MSA position is determined by how much the lifestyle misclassification error increases when the residues at the MSA position are shuffled within the position across the 96 sequences, prior to computing the random forest lifestyle prediction. If the misclassification error increases very little when residues at a position are shuffled, such a position is evidently not very important for lifestyle determination. Alternatively, if a misclassification error rises sharply following residue permutation, the residue distribution at such an MSA position is strongly associated with lifestyle. Furthermore, one can separately examine misclassification error changes for homologous sequences associated with a specific lifestyle to obtain lifestyle-specific VI measures. In summary, from the MSA of all homologs, random forest VI analysis can be used to identify MSA positions at which the distribution of residues is predictive of lifestyle.\nOur analysis indicates that position 434 in the MSA consensus sequence has the highest VI value for correctly predicting the plant pathogen lifestyle. The top 10 positions are shown in Figure 7 and Supplementary Fig. S6. Position 434 corresponds to BEC1019 position Glu 208, 22 residues downstream of the HRxxH motif and on an exposed surface helix in a structural model for BEC1019 (Supplementary Fig. S7), generated using the Phyre2 server ( Kelley and Sternberg 2009 ). Three more of the top 10 MSA positions (372, 390, and 391) for predicting plant pathogen lifestyle are between the ETVIC and HRxxH motifs, with the Phe at position 372 also occurring in an exposed helix and the other two (Ala at 390 and Thr at 391) in a surface loop. Another of the top 10, Ser 147, is at the junction of a β sheet and a loop in the model and is a possible target for phosphorylation. Five of the remaining six positions (222, 285, 344, 345, and 362) are on exposed loops. The final one, 553, in a relatively nonconserved region near the carboxyl end of the proteins, is not represented in the model.\nDownload figure as PPT\nFig. 7.\nRandom forest analysis of the alignment of BEC1019 and homologs.

Here, using BSMV-VIGS, we were able to examine powdery mildew development in whole leaves, using a new image processing program and also to quantify expression of BEC1019, using qRT-PCR to establish that, with BEC1019 silenced, B. graminis is less able to proliferate on the leaf surface ( Fig. 1 ). In addition, using a vector we engineered for expression of proteins as fusions to the T3S signal of AvrBs2, we were able to further functionally characterize BEC1019 and determine that it suppresses both the barley cultivar-nonspecific HR induced by X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256 ( Fig. 2 ) and ETI induced by AvrPphB ( Fig. 3 ). Taken together, these data support the conclusion that BEC1019 contributes to B. graminis virulence as a suppressor of host defense.\nIn the T3S assay, BEC1019 did not render barley susceptible to colonization by the nonhost pathogens X. campestris pv. raphani 756C or X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256. Rather, it simply prevented the drop in bacterial populations that otherwise occurs as a result of the plant HR. This suggests that BEC1019 may interfere specifically and perhaps exclusively with the HR and not affect basal defenses. In a future study, it would be of interest to pursue this question by first testing whether BEC1019 can enhance barley susceptibility to diverse compatible pathogens that do not contain a native BEC1019, such as X. translucens, the causal agent of bacterial leaf streak, or Puccinia graminis tritici, the causal agent of stem rust.\nWith the exception of Polyporales, a classification under Basidiomycota, genes encoding homologs of BEC1019 are present in at least one species from every major fungal taxon in which a minimum of five genomes have been sequenced; in total, a homologous gene is present in 96 of 240 sequenced fungi. These fungi have diverse lifestyles, including obligate plant pathogens, necrotrophic animal pathogens, and free-living nonpathogenic fungi. Most fungal effectors characterized to date share almost no sequence similarity to one another or to any known proteins ( Stergiopoulos and de Wit 2009 ). Very few Blumeria effector candidates show clear homology to known proteins. This trend may simply reflect the fact that lack of homology to proteins outside the powdery mildews was considered an indicator of likely effector function in annotating the B. graminis genome ( Pedersen et al. 2012 ; Spanu et al. 2010 ). Nonetheless, to our knowledge, only two fungal effectors are known to be conserved in multiple species. Ecp6, first identified in Cladosporium fulvum, is one of at least 17 homologs found in 12 species ( Bolton et al. 2008 ). Ecp2, another C. fulvum effector, is a member of the Hce2 superfamily, which comprises 153 homologs (many of them are paralogs within species) across 52 species ( Stergiopoulos et al. 2012 ). The broad conservation of BEC1019 thus sets this effector apart and suggests that BEC1019 homologs, collectively and perhaps individually, play not only roles in pathogen-host interactions but also a yet-undefined, broader role in fungal ecology.\nConservation of multiple amino acid residues across the BEC1019 family, in particular the ETVIC motif, five additional cysteine residues, and the HRxxH motif ( Fig. 5 ) suggested that these residues are important in the function of BEC1019. Site-directed mutagenesis of each of these, however, identified only V150, I151, and C152 from the ETVIC motif as required for HR suppression in the T3S system assay ( Fig. 6 ). Intriguingly, random forest analysis identified residues at several variable positions as highly correlated with plant parasitism ( Fig. 7 ). Whether any is determinative awaits further experimentation, but all are predicted to be surface localized in a BEC1019 structural model, and thus, are available for interaction with a host molecule; also, several are in the vicinity of the functionally important ETVIC motif.\nSeveral NLR R proteins contain an EDVID motif in the coiled coil (CC) domain. Mutation of the acidic residues (E and D) compromises binding of the CC domain to the barley MLA10 NLR ( Rairdan et al. 2008 ) and abolishes activation of HR by full-length proteins ( Bai et al. 2012 ). It may be that, while the EDVID sequence in the R proteins is required to initiate HR, the BEC1019 ETVIC motif is needed to suppress HR, possibly by competition for a common target. It is also important to note that an EIVIC motif in the putative metalloprotease effector AVR-Pita from Magnaporthe oryzae ( Jia et al. 2000 ; Orbach et al. 2000 ) is in a similar position to that of the BEC1019 ETVIC motif in the predicted structures of these proteins (Supplementary Fig. S8). The ETVIC motif does not coincide in the structural models with catalytic site residues identified in deuterolysin, a structurally solved protease from Aspergillus oryzae that was used in the modeling ( Fushimi et al. 1999 ; McAuley et al. 2001 ). Whether ETVIC is central to any proteolytic activity of BEC1019 (or AVR-Pita) or plays some other role remains to be tested.\nThat mutations in the HRxxH motif had no apparent effect on BEC1019 activity in the T3S assay leaves the importance of this motif, if any, an open question. B. graminis secretes effector proteins from the haustorial membrane into the extrahaustorial matrix. The means by which some of those proteins then enter the host cell is currently unknown. Conceivably, HRxxH plays a role in translocation across the plant plasma membrane, following secretion by the fungus. Because the T3S system delivers proteins directly to the host cell cytoplasm, disruption of any translocation-related structure in BEC1019 would not be detected in that assay. Several studies have shown that oomycete effectors depend on an N-terminal RxLR motif for translocation ( Sun et al. 2013 ; Tyler et al. 2013 ). HRxxH falls under a broad definition of the RxLR motif proposed by Kale and colleagues (2010) , but it is located toward the C-terminus of BEC1019 and is part of a predicted cleft in the protein ( Fig. 5 ).\nCurrently characterized as a “fungal allergen domain with unknown function” ( Punta et al. 2012 ) (Pfam database), HRxxH is conserved in all but three of the identified BEC1019 homologs in OG5_142791, including those in free-living fungi. This observation suggests that instead of or in addition to any translocation function, HRxxH may serve a role unrelated to effector function. It is similar to the highly conserved metalloendoprotease signature HExxH (NCBI Conserved Domain Database entry cd11307). The two histidines in this motif represent two of three zinc-binding residues; the third residue is typically glutamic acid or aspartic acid ( Vallee and Auld 1990 ). Though neither of the BEC1019 homologs Asp F2 and Pra1 has been shown to have protease activity when tested with casein as a substrate ( Amich et al. 2010 ; Citiulo et al. 2012 ), Asp F2 plays a role in zinc acquisition ( Amich et al. 2010 ) and Pra1 can directly bind zinc ( Citiulo et al. 2012 ). Three-dimensional modeling predicts that Pra1 interacts with the zinc transporter Zrt1, a protein also shown to be important for Candida albicans virulence ( Citiulo et al. 2012 ). The Pra1 and Zrt1 genes are physically linked in the Candida albicans genome and are transcriptionally coregulated, as they share a common promoter ( Citiulo et al. 2012 ; Nobile et al. 2009 ). The B. graminis genome encodes two Zrt1 homologs. However, neither of those genes is physically linked to BEC1019 ( Spanu et al. 2010 ). Similarly, the BEC1019 homolog in Magnaporthe oryzae is not linked to any Zrt1 homolog, though in Ustilago maydis, the BEC1019 homolog is found next to a zinc transporter gene ( Citiulo et al. 2012 ). Whether BEC1019 binds zinc or interacts with any zinc transporter, whether those properties involve the HRxxH motif, and how they may benefit the fungus remain to be tested.\nThe possible dual or even multiple roles of BEC1019 suggest a plausible path for effector evolution in which a protein that serves a conserved function of fundamental importance across many fungal lifestyles proves adaptive for symbiosis or is repurposed specifically for interaction with a host. It is conceivable, for example, that BEC1019 and its homologs detoxify certain antimicrobials, possibly peptides or reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that this function depends on the conserved motifs. Such a function would be advantageous for free-living or pathogenic fungi and might have been particularly adaptive for plant biotrophs. Indeed, localization to the host cell cytoplasm and scavenging of ROS there could be the mechanism of HR suppression; this would not be a neofunctionalization per se but a localization-dependent repurposing. It is important to note, however, that, although BEC1019 functioning inside the host cell to suppress HR is a compelling hypothesis supported by our data, we cannot exclude the possibility that BEC1019 contributes to B. graminis colonization by protecting the fungus from antimicrobials in the extrahaustorial matrix and that the HR suppression is a byproduct of type III delivery of BEC1019 activity into the host cell.\nIn any case, the broad distribution of the BEC1019 family of proteins, including several highly conserved motifs, underscores the notion that proteins clearly can retain core features that perform important roles in diverse contexts. The BEC1019 family, in which different members function in pathogenesis of plants versus animals, may provide an opportunity to discover broadly effective means of controlling fungal growth and infections important in both medicine and agriculture ( Rovenich et al. 2014 ).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSection:\nPlant material and fungal isolates for VIGS assay.\nSeedlings of barley lines CI 16151 (Mla6) ( Moseman 1972 ), HOR11358 (Mla9), and CIho 2277 (Black Hull-less) were grown in a temperature-controlled greenhouse with supplemental lighting. Following BSMV-VIGS, plants were transferred to a temperature-controlled growth chamber with a 16-h photoperiod, with light intensity ranging from 400 to 1,000 μmol m–2 s–1, and day and night temperatures of 24 and 20°C, respectively. B. graminis f. sp. hordei isolate 5874 (avra9) was propagated on Hordeum vulgare cv. Morex in a controlled growth chamber at 18°C (16 h of light and 8 h of darkness).\nBSMV-VIGS.\nA 264-bp region in the middle of the BEC1019 gene was amplified by PCR, using primers that add PacI and NotI restriction sites to the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. These sites enabled ligation of the fragment in antisense orientation into the BSMV:γ vector ( Meng et al. 2009 ). The resulting construct was designated BSMV:1019368-632 ( Fig. 1C ). BEC1019 was silenced in B. graminis isolate 5874 by mechanical infection of 7-day-old seedlings of the barley host cultivar HOR 11358 (Mla9) with homogenate from plants previously infected by BSMV:1019368-632 via biolistic bombardment ( Halterman and Wise 2004 ).\nThe control construct BSMV:00 was tested in the same way. Mock inoculation used homogenate of plants not infected with BMSV. Plants were maintained for 12 days in a growth chamber (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, U.S.A.) with 16 h of light at 24°C (550 µmol m−2 s−1) and 8 h of dark at 20°C. Plants were then inoculated with B. graminis isolate 5874 (avra9) conidiospores (compatible interaction with HOR 11358) and were maintained in a growth chamber with 16 h of light and 8 h of dark at 18°C. The infection phenotype was monitored for 7 days.\nImaging of B. graminis infection phenotypes.\nAt 7 days after powdery mildew inoculation, for each treatment (Mock, BSMV:00, and BSMV:1019368-632), five of the plants inoculated were randomly selected and the third leaf of each was harvested. The set of five leaves for each treatment was photographed at high resolution (2,592 pixels × 3,456 pixels, i.e., 9 Megapixels at a 4:3 aspect ratio), using a Canon PowerShot SX110 IS and the Vidpro professional Photo and Video LED light kit model Z-96K. The leaves were set on black felt for uniform, high-contrast background. Immediately after imaging, the leaves were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. This process was repeated for the remaining plants in the experimental replicate.\nLeafQuant-VIGS.\nImages of B. graminis infection phenotypes had two important qualities: (i) there was high color contrast between the background (i.e., the black felt) and the leaves, and (ii) images were high resolution (approximately 9 Megapixels at a 4:3 aspect ratio). An application named LeafQuant-VIGS was developed, using MathWorks MATLAB 7.14 and Image Processing Toolbox 8.0, to analyze these images to find discoloration on leaves as a measure of B. graminis infection-associated biomass. LeafQuant-VIGS software is offered under MIT license via the GitHub repository.\nLeafQuant-VIGS analysis takes the following steps to convert an RGB image from the camera into a grayscale image where the discoloration of leaves is proportional to the grayscale.\nUser input of parameters. LeafQuant-VIGS MATLAB function is defined as LeafQuant_v1(exprID, repID, cropImageFirst, showHistogram, numOfLeaves, exposureVal). ExprID and repID are strings representing experiment and replicate identification for user reference. CropImageFirst is a Boolean flag where, if true, the interface will let the user choose an area of the image to analyze, and, if false, the application will process the entire image. ShowHistogram is also a Boolean flag, which, if true, a histogram of infection level per leaf will be shown. NumOfLeaves is an integer specifying the number of leaves that are expected in the image or cropped region. ExposureVal is a multiplier for the nongreen pixel colors that are subtracted from the green channel. For example, a value of 2 would subtract the color contribution of the red and blue channels from the green channel twice.\nDetection of background and leaves as separate components in the image. This step exploits the high color contrast between the background and the leaves. Otsu’s method ( Otsu 1979 ) is a histogram-based threshold selection method. LeafQuant-VIGS uses its implementation provided in the Image Processing Toolbox to separate the background from the foreground (i.e., leaves). Leaf boundaries are detected using an 8-connected neighborhood method implemented in MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox.\nConversion of background to uniform black. LeafQuant-VIGS makes the background uniformly black before beginning to convert the image to grayscale for the purpose of quantification.\nConversion of the leaves from RGB to grayscale colors. Every pixel of an RGB image shows a color based on the contribution from three primary color channels (red, green, blue). To find the amount of discoloration (hyphal growth) of a pixel on a green leaf, the contribution from the green channel has to be removed. The following formula is used to remove the contribution of the green channel from each of the red and blue color channels, and the resulting value is stored in a separate channel. This transforms the image into a grayscale image.\nPixelValue\n0\n.\nOnce the image is converted to grayscale, a count of pixels in various gray intensity levels is saved. LeafQuant-VIGS provides histograms of the discoloration distribution per leaf, and it reports the mean, median, and quantiles of the results as a csv (comma separated values) file for further processing.\nStatistical analysis of LeafQuant-VIGS data.\nFour separate linear mixed model analyses of the LeafQuant-VIGS data were conducted. All models used percent infection as the response and included random effects for replications and images within replications. The first model was used to test the significance of a single fixed slope coefficient on log2 relative expression of BEC1019 in BSMV:1019368-632 treated leaves (P value = 0.0071). The second model was used to compare the mean percent infection of BSMV:00 treated leaves with the mean percent infection for BSMV:1019368-632 treated leaves that had relative BEC1019 expression less than 1.0 (the P value for this analysis was 0.0046). Thus, this model involved a single fixed factor with two levels (one level for each of the two leaf types: BSMV:00 versus BSMV:1019368-632 with relative expression <1.0). The third model was used to compare the mean percent infection of BSMV:00-treated leaves with the mean percent infection for BSMV:1019368-632-treated leaves that had relative BEC1019 expression greater than 1.0 (this analysis had a P value of 0.5109). This model also involved a single fixed factor with two levels (BSMV:00 versus BSMV:1019368-632 with relative expression >1.0). The fourth model was applied to BSMV:1019368-632-treated leaves to compare the mean percent infection with relative expression less than 1.0 with the mean percent infection with relative expression greater than 1.0 (the P value for this analysis was 0.0019). This model had a single factor defined by relative expression of BEC1019 (less than 1.0 versus greater than 1.0).\nLeafQuant-T3S.\nQuantification of results in the T3S assay was performed using a variation of LeafQuant-VIGS called LeafQuant-T3S, developed using lessons learned from LeafQuant-VIGS. Like LeafQuant-VIGS, LeafQuant-T3S was developed using MathWorks MATLAB 7.14 and Image Processing Toolbox 8.0 to analyze images and find levels of discoloration on leaves. The images had the following important parameters: (i) there were multiple regions within a leaf to be quantified, (ii) regions for quantification were less well-defined compared with VIGS, and (iii) images were high resolution, similar to VIGS images. LeafQuant-T3S will be offered under MIT license at the GitHub repository website.\nLeafQuant-T3S analysis takes the following steps.\nManual selection of the infiltrated areas in a leaf within the image. Once MATLAB loads the image of leaves, the user is prompted to make a selection, elliptical in shape, on an infiltrated region of a leaf.\nConversion of the nonselected region of the image to uniform black. LeafQuant-T3S crops the image at the edges of the selected region. Within that cropped image, the background and nonselected leaf regions are masked by conversion to uniform black.\nConversion of the selected regions of the leaf from RGB to grayscale colors. The cropped image from step ii is processed similarly to the method described for LeafQuant-VIGS (part iv).\nOnce the image is converted to grayscale, a count of pixels in various gray intensity levels is reported. Whereas in the VIGS images the percentage of leaf showing discoloration is an important metric, quantification in the T3S experiment is based on the average level of discoloration in a selected (infiltrated) region of a leaf. This allows comparison of the extent of HR in different infiltrations within and across leaves. LeafQuant-T3S reports values for individual spots as well as an average discoloration measure in the output.\nStatistical analysis of LeafQuant-T3S output.\nA mixed linear model analysis ( Wolfinger et al. 2001 ) for the T3S data was performed using the SAS PROC MIXED procedure. Contrast statements in SAS were made for various two-way comparisons between treatment samples within an experiment. Comparisons were done both overall between treatments and also when controlling for position. The treatment, position, and their interaction were the fixed factors and replication for any treatment was the random factor. The P values for multiple testing were adjusted according to Hochberg (1988) . Subsequently, the mean infection for each treatment in an experiment was plotted using “gplots” in R software for all three positions (top, middle, bottom).\nqRT-PCR.\nIndividual leaves stored at −80 C were pulverized in liquid nitrogen and total RNA was extracted using Trizol-like reagent ( Caldo et al. 2004 ). Genomic DNA was degraded by RNase-free DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX, U.S.A.). SuperScript III reverse transcription (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) was used to synthesize first strand cDNA using 2 µg of total RNA and oligo(dT)20 primer.\nThis cDNA was used as a template for qRT-PCR to determine expression of BEC1019 relative to B. graminis β-tubulin. Barley1 contig_3802 and contig_16884 from the Affymetrix GeneChip Genome Array 900515 ( Close et al. 2004 ) (GenBank ID dbj|AK356480.1|), determined to be optimal steady state controls via the Fluctuation Filter tool at the Plant Expression database ( Dash et al. 2012 ), were also included as references. Primers for BEC1019 were designed to amplify a 3′ fragment of the region used for the silencing construct ( Fig. 1 ). The qRT-PCR was performed using a Bio-Rad iCycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, U.S.A.). Conditions for 20-μl reactions using PerfeCTa SYBR Green FastMix for iQ (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD, U.S.A.) were 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min, a melt curve was then determined by starting at 55°C for 10 s, and then, increasing by 0.5°C every 10 s for 80 cycles. Three technical replicates for each biological sample were included in each experiment. Target gene expression was calculated using the 2−∆CT method. The fold change due to silencing was calculated by dividing the individual expression value for each BSMV:1019368-632-treated leaf by the mean value measured in BSMV:00 treated plants ( Schmittgen and Livak 2008 ).\nBEC1019 sequence analysis.\nThe BEC1019 gene in the first published B. graminis f. sp. hordei genome sequence ( Spanu et al. 2010 ) resides at the end of a contig. Sequence alignment with closely related homologs showed that it was likely truncated in this contig. We therefore examined alternative assemblies and identified a few in which the locus extended beyond the end of the original contig. This sequence was used to design primers for the amplification of a full-length BEC1019 cDNA, thus demonstrating the validity of the alternative genome assemblies at this locus, which was deposited in GenBank (KJ571201). In parallel, BEC1019 was identified as a protein expressed specifically in haustoria, annotated in e!EnsemblFungi as CCU74634.1, bgh03531_mRNA and in UniProtKB as N1J6C9 (partial protein) ( Bindschedler et al. 2011 ) but also annotated as CELP0023 ( Pedersen et al. 2012 ).\nThe full-length amino acid sequence of BEC1019 was used as the query for a blastp search of the nonredundant protein sequence databases at NCBI ( Johnson et al. 2008 ), the Broad Institute Fungal Genome Initiative, and the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute ( Grigoriev et al. 2012 ). Hits with an E value below 1 × 10−15 were submitted to OrthoMCL ( Chen et al. 2006 ), which placed 96 of the 97 in one ortholog group, OG5_142791. The 96 sequences from OG5_142791 were aligned together and a relatedness tree was drawn using the MegAlign program of the Lasergene software package (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, U.S.A.) with default settings. The MSA also served as input to generate the WebLogo ( Crooks et al. 2004 ; Schneider and Stephens 1990 ). DISULFIND ( Ceroni et al. 2006 ) was used to predict disulfide bonds in BEC1019.\nBacterial culture and plant growth conditions for the T3S assay.\nEscherichia coli strains were grown using Luria-Bertani broth or agar at 37°C. Xanthomonas strains were grown using glucose-yeast extract liquid or agar (2% glucose, 1% yeast extract) at 28°C. Antibiotics were used for selection as follows (μg/ml): ampicillin at 100; chloramphenicol, 10; kanamycin, 25; and spectinomycin, 25. Barley plants were grown in growth chambers at 21°C on a 16-h light and 8-h dark cycle under cool white, high-output fluorescent lights, maintained to provide 85 to 112 μmol/m2/s at soil level. Autoclaved Cornell Mix (10.6 cubic ft. of compressed peat moss, 12 cubic ft of vermiculite, 20 lb of dolomitic limestone, and 6 lb of 11-5-11 fertilizer yielding approximately 1.2 cubic yards of mix) was used for potting. Plants were watered daily, starting from the third day after sowing.\nPlasmid constructs for the T3S assay.\nTo construct the Gateway destination vector pYM5, first the avrRpt2 coding sequence in broad host range plasmid pDD62 (avrBs21–97+avrRpt280–255) ( Mudgett et al. 2000 ) was excised using HindIII and XhoI and was replaced with Gateway cassette reading frame B (Life Technologies) that had been previously cloned into pTOPO-TA (Life Technologies), yielding pYM1. For technical reasons, the reading frame was then changed to Reading Frame A, using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, U.S.A.), to create pYM5. Coding sequences for BEC1019, without the predicted signal peptide, were amplified via PCR and were cloned into pCR8 using TOPO cloning (Life Technologies) and mutations were made to BEC1019 using QuikChange mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, U.S.A.); clones were then transferred into pYM5 by Gateway LR reaction (Life Technologies). In pYM5, the avrBs2 coding sequence is preceded by the native avrBs2 promoter and, upstream of that, the lac promoter, which is constitutive in Xanthomonas. Negative control plasmid pYMAJ1 (expressing only the AvrBs2 T3S signal) was created by replacing the Gateway cassette in pYM5 with a double-stranded oligonucleotide that places a stop codon at the end of the avrBs2 coding sequence and adds a diagnostic EcoRI site. For delivery of AvrPphB, a clone in pVSP61 with the native avrPphB promoter and no translational fusion, described previously ( Simonich and Innes 1995 ), was used. The progenitor of pYM5, pDD62, is a derivative of pVSP61, so all plasmids used share the same backbone, including the origin of replication.\nXanthomonas T3S assay.\nXanthomonas cells were harvested from plates cultured for 48 h at 28°C and were suspended in 10 mM MgCl2. Suspensions were diluted and mixed as specified in the figure legends and were then infiltrated into primary leaves of 10-day-old barley seedlings, using a needleless syringe. For each suspension mixture, three leaves were infiltrated at three different spots per leaf, using approximately 40 μl per spot. Leaves were photographed and scored 5 days following infiltration. Plants were maintained in a growth chamber throughout. Experiments were repeated at least twice.\nQuantification of bacterial populations.\nAt 0, 3, and 6 days after infiltration, leaf sections 1 cm in length centered on an infiltration spot were ground in 300 μl of 10 mM MgCl2, and bacterial cells were quantified by dilution plating. A mixed linear model analysis was performed using the SAS PROC MIXED procedure to determine significance of differences in bacterial counts.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nSection:\nThe authors thank J.

Because transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is a potent regulator of ASM cell proliferation, we determined its expression and mitogenic signaling pathways in ASM cells. We obtained ASM cells by laser capture microdissection of bronchial biopsies and found that ASM cells from asthmatic patients expressed TGF-β1 mRNA and protein to a greater extent than nonasthmatic individuals using real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. TGF-β1 stimulated the growth of nonconfluent and confluent ASM cells either in the presence or absence of serum in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The mitogenic activity of TGF-β1 on ASM cells was inhibited by selective inhibitors of TGF-β receptor I kinase (SD-208), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K, LY-294002), ERK (PD-98059), JNK (SP-600125), and NF-κB (AS-602868). On the other hand, p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB-203580) augmented TGF-β1-induced proliferation. To study role of the Smads, we transduced ASM cells with an adenovirus vector-expressing Smad4, Smad7, or dominant-negative Smad3 and found no involvement of these Smads in TGF-β1-induced proliferation. Dexamethasone caused a dose-dependent inhibition in TGF-β1-induced proliferation. Our findings suggest that TGF-β1 may act in an autocrine fashion to induce ASM hyperplasia, mediated by its receptor and several kinases including PI3K, ERK, and JNK, whereas p38 MAPK is a negative regulator. NF-κB is also involved in the TGF-β1 mitogenic signaling, but Smad pathway does not appear important.\nincreased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass is one of the characteristic structural changes of the asthmatic airway ( 11 ) that may contribute to the airflow obstruction of asthma ( 12 ). Indeed, both ASM hyperplasia and hypertrophy are observed in the airway wall remodeling present in asthma ( 12 ). The mechanisms that mediate these changes in ASM are little known. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is a regulator of cell growth and differentiation with profibrotic properties ( 10 , 32 ). Increased expression of TGF-β has been detected in asthmatic bronchial biopsy specimens localized to inflammatory cells in airway mucosa such as eosinophils and to structural cells such as fibroblasts and epithelial cells; increased levels have also been measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from patients with asthma ( 23 , 31 , 35 ). There has been little focus as to whether ASM cells from asthmatic patients have enhanced TGF-β expression ( 35 ). Blockade of TGF-β activity prevents airway wall remodeling features including ASM hyperplasia in rat and murine models of chronic allergen exposure ( 19 , 21 ), implying that TGF-β may be a potential mediator of ASM hyperplasia in asthma. TGF-β stimulates human ASM cell growth in the presence of 5% FCS and EGF ( 9 ) and increases DNA synthesis of human or bovine ASM cells in the presence or absence of serum in a growth factor-independent manner ( 2 , 7 , 25 ). Paradoxically, TGF-β has been reported to inhibit EGF- and thrombin-induced DNA synthesis of human ASM cells ( 8 ) and FBS-induced proliferation of bovine ASM cells ( 25 ). Furthermore, TGF-β has also been shown to induce human ASM cell proliferation only in the presence of growth factors such as FGF-2 ( 3 ). These conflicting data may result from the use of different culture conditions, such as the presence of serum at varying concentrations, the degree of cell confluence, and the addition of different growth inducers.\nThe intracellular mechanisms that mediate TGFβ-induced ASM cell proliferation have been the subject of recent investigation, but there are still areas of uncertainty. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and MAPK may play an important role in the regulation of ASM growth ( 18 , 26 ), since phosphorylation of the D3 position of the inositol ring of membrane phosphoinositides by PI3K is crucial for control of cell survival, division, and migration. PI3K has been implicated both in induction of cell growth and regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase activity. ERK plays an important role in ASM cell proliferation as well as in survival mediated by many growth factors, whereas JNK and p38 MAPK may regulate ASM cell growth and apoptosis ( 7 ). A role for Smads in mediating TGF-β intracellular signaling has been identified in the induction of gene expression, cell proliferation, and differentiation ( 5 , 15 , 16 , 24 ), but it is uncertain whether Smads mediate TGF-β-induced ASM cell growth. The ubiquitous inflammatory transcription factor, NF-κB, modulates TGF-β expression in airway epithelial cells and can functionally cooperate with TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway ( 22 ). However, the role of NF-κB in TGF-β-mediated ASM hyperplasia is not known.\nIn this study, we determined whether there is an increased TGF-β1 expression in asthmatic ASM cells and its effects on ASM cell growth under different culture conditions, particularly in relation to the state of confluence of ASM cells in the absence or presence of a range of serum concentrations. To delineate the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the growth regulatory effect of TGF-β1, we investigated the role of TGF-β receptor (TβR) kinase, PI3K, and MAPKs and explored whether NF-κB and Smads were involved in the mitogenic signaling.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nMaterials\nRecombinant human TGF-β1 was purchased from R&D Systems (Abingdon, United Kingdom). PD-98059, SB-203580, and LY-294002 were obtained from Calbiochem (Nottingham, United Kingdom). SD-208 was a kind gift from Scios (Fremont, CA) and SP-600125 from Celgene (San Diego, CA). AS-602868 was from Serono. Primers for TGF-β1 were obtained from Sigma-Genosys (Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom). RNase-free slides, reagents, and other materials for laser capture microdissection (LCM) were purchased from Arcturus (Hertfordshire, United Kingdom). Dexamethasone, crystal violet, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), FCS, BSA, and all other tissue culture reagents and media were from Sigma (Dorset, United Kingdom).\nCell Culture and Treatment\nASM cells were isolated from fresh lobar or main bronchus obtained from lung resection donors and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS as described previously ( 39 ). ASM cell characteristics were identified by light microscopy with typical “hill and valley” appearance and by positive immunostaining of smooth muscle (SM) α-actin, SM myosin heavy chain, calponin, and SM-22. The cells were maintained in T-175 culture flasks at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. ASM cells were studied from passages 2 to 6.\nCells were trypsinized and subcultured in 24-well plates for cell proliferation assay. ASM cells were grown in 10% FCS/DMEM to reach 30% confluence, and then FCS concentration was changed to 0.1–10% in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 or the appropriate test reagents. To test the effect of TGF-β1 on confluent ASM cells, cells were grown in 10% FCS/DMEM to reach confluence before the treatments. For protein analyses by Western blotting, ASM cells were incubated in six-well plates in 10% FCS/DMEM to reach confluence before the treatments. Control cultures were incubated in the same medium containing vehicle alone. Cells were redosed in fresh medium every 2–3 days.\nLCM\nTo examine the expression of TGF-β1 in ASM, bronchial biopsies were obtained from 12 normal volunteers [age = 22 ± 3 yr, male/female = 8/4, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) = 101 ± 15% of predicted] and 11 asthmatic patients (age = 33 ± 12 yr, male/female = 5/6, FEV1 = 84 ± 18% of predicted), using fiber optic bronchoscopy ( 33 ). The protocols have been approved by the local Ethics Committee and all subjects gave their informed consent. The airway biopsies were embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound (OCT) on dry ice and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at −80°C. Frozen sections were cut at 6-μm thickness and mounted on LCM slides (Arcturus). The slides were immediately stored on dry ice and then at −80°C until used. Sections were fixed in 70% ethanol for 30 s and stained and dehydrated in a series of graded ethanol followed by xylene using HistoGene LCM frozen section staining kit (Arcturus) according to the manufacturer's instruction. ASM cells were captured onto the CapSure HS LCM caps (Arcturus) by a Pixcell II LCM system (Arcturus, Mountain View, CA), and total RNA was extracted by using a PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Arcturus) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nReal-Time PCR\nTotal RNA extracted from ASM cells collected by LCM was reverse-transcribed to cDNA (RoboCycler, Stratagene) using random hexamers and an avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). cDNA was amplified by quantitative real-time PCR (Rotor-Gene 3000, Corbett Research) using SYBR Green PCR master mix reagent (Qiagen). The human TGF-β1 forward and reverse primers were 5′ -CCCAGCATCTGCAAAGCTC-3′ and 5′ -GTCAATGTACAGCTGCCGCA-3′. Each primer was used at a concentration of 0.5 μM in each reaction. Cycling conditions were as follows: step 1, 15 min at 95°C; step 2, 20 s at 94°C; step 3, 20 s at 60°C; step 4, 20 s at 72°C, with repeat from step 2 to step 4 40 times. Data from the reaction were collected and analyzed by the complementary computer software (Corbett Research). Relative quantitations of gene expression were calculated using standard curve and normalized to GAPDH in each sample ( 39 ).\nImmunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression of TGF-β1 in human bronchial tissue sections. Bronchial biopsies were embedded in OCT and stored at −80°C before use. Frozen sections (6 μm) were cut and then fixed in cold acetone for 10 min. Sections were incubated in 10% normal horse serum to block nonspecific binding, followed by a mouse anti-human TGF-β1 antibody (1 μg/ml, AbCam ab1279) for 1 h at room temperature. Control slides were performed with normal mouse immunoglobulin. Anti-mouse biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) was applied to the sections for 1 h at room temperature, followed by 1.6% hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Sections were incubated with the avidin/biotinylated peroxidase complex for 30 min, followed by chromogenic substrate diaminobenzidine for 3 min, and then counterstained in hematoxylin and mounted on aqueous mounting medium. Immunoreactivity for TGF-β1 was expressed as intensity of staining that was graded from 0 to 3 (0, no staining; 1, weak staining; 2, moderate staining; 3, strong staining). The slides were coded, and the reader was unaware of the source of the biopsies.\nCrystal Violet Proliferation Assay\nCrystal violet assay (CVA) was used to determine ASM cell growth ( 40 ). On selected days, the cell layer was washed once with PBS. Cell were fixed and stained by 0.5% crystal violet solution in 25% methanol. After 10 min, the excess dye was removed by washing in tap water, and the cells were then air-dried for at least 20 h. Image processing was performed using an Axioplan microscope (Zeiss, Munich, Germany), and images were captured using an Axiocam digital camera (Zeiss). Then, the incorporated dye was solubilized in 1 ml of 0.1 M sodium citrate solution in 50% ethanol, and 100 μl was transferred to a 96-well plate. To determine cell number in each sample, the optical density (OD) was measured directly at a wavelength of 550 nm in a Spectramax Plus reader (Molecular Devices). The OD of each sample was then compared with a standard curve in which the OD was directly proportional to known cell number.\nMTT Assay\nMTT assay was used to determine cell viability and proliferation. On selected days, the culture medium was removed, and ASM cells were incubated with 1 mg/ml MTT solution in an incubator at 37°C for 10–30 min. After removing MTT solution, 300 μl of DMSO was added to each well of 24-well plate, and 100 μl was transferred to a 96-well plate. Absorbency at 550-nm OD was detected. The OD of each sample was then compared with a standard curve in which the OD was directly proportional to known cell numbers.\nSmad Transduction\nSmad-expressing adenoviruses were a kind gift from Dr. Aristidis Moustakas ( 17 ). Adenoviruses carrying the vector-expressing Flag-tagged Smad4, Smad7, dominant-negative Smad3 (DNS3), or β-galactosidase (the null) were titered by endpoint dilution and plaque assay to determine plaque-forming units. Viruses were diluted in 10% FBS/DMEM to a multiplicity of infection of 30 (30 viruses per cell) before infection of ASM cells. This dose of virus had no effect on cell viability, and ∼95% transduction efficiencies in ASM cells was obtained as detected by green fluorescent protein-expressing adenoviruses ( 6 ). The adenovirus-mediated expression of Smads in the infected ASM cells was confirmed by Western blots using an anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (Sigma). In cell growth assays, the adenovirus-containing medium was removed 24 h after infection, and cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 in the presence of 2.5% FCS/DMEM. For induction of the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which was used as a positive control in this study as it is a target gene of TGF-β, the adenovirus-containing medium was removed 24 h after infection, and cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 under serum-free condition for a further 3 days ( 39 ).\nWestern Blotting\nAs described previously ( 39 ), total cell protein was extracted and fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% Tris-glycine precast gel (Invitrogen), followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham). The membrane was incubated overnight at 4°C with an antibody for CTGF (0.5 μg/ml, Abcam). The next day, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody raised against rabbit IgG (1:2,000, Cell Signaling Technology) at room temperature. Antibody-bound proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. The membranes were stripped and then reprobed with a mouse anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (1:5,000; Biogenesis, Poole, United Kingdom) to control for the loading. Relevant band intensities were quantified by scanning densitometric analysis using software from Ultra-Violet Products (Cambridge, United Kingdom). Densitometric data were normalized for GAPDH values.\nData Analysis\nData were analyzed by ANOVA or t-test (Mann-Whitney U test for immunohistochemistry). Results are expressed as means ± SD and are representative of at least three separate experiments from three ASM cell donors. P < 0.05 was taken as statistically significant.\nRESULTS\nTGF-β1 mRNA and Protein Expression in ASM Cells of Asthmatic Patients\nTo determine whether human ASM cells express TGF-β1 mRNA in situ, LCM was performed on sections of human bronchial biopsies obtained from four normal volunteers and three asthmatic patients. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that in situ ASM cells from asthmatics expressed higher levels of TGF-β1 mRNA than those from nonasthmatic volunteers (P = 0.029; Fig. 1A ) .\nFig. 1.Increased expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 mRNA and protein in asthmatic airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. Sections from human bronchial biopsies were prepared. A: laser capture microdissection (LCM) was performed to collect ASM cells. TGF-β1 and GAPDH mRNA expression was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR from 4 normal controls and 3 asthmatics. Data are expressed as a ratio of target gene-to-GAPDH mRNA control. B: TGF-β1 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry. C: immunostaining intensity was detected from 10 normal controls and 8 asthmatics. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 compared with control.\nDownload                 figure Download PowerPoint\nImmunohistochemistry of human bronchial biopsy samples (obtained from 10 normal and 8 asthmatic donors) showed weak intensity of immunostaining for TGF-β1 in ASM cells of control samples ( Fig. 1B ). Compared with the controls, TGF-β1 expression of ASM cells was significantly increased in asthmatic patients (P = 0.002; Fig. 1 , B and C). There was no staining in the negative control sections in which the mouse anti-TGF-β1 antibody was replaced by normal mouse immunoglobulin (data not shown).\nTGF-β1 and ASM Cell Growth\nTGF-β1 stimulates nonconfluent ASM cell growth in serum-containing media.\nTo investigate the effect of TGF-β1 on growth of nonconfluent ASM cells undergoing an exponential growth, cells were incubated in 24-well plates with 10% FCS to 30% confluence and then exposed to TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) in the presence of 0.1–10% FCS. Cell growth ( Fig. 2 , A and B) was detected after 6 days of treatment by CVA. TGF-β1 increased ASM cell growth by two- to fivefold in the presence of 0.1–5% FCS with no effect at 10% FCS compared with the controls ( Fig. 2B ). Similar results were obtained using MTT assay (data not shown). The mitogenic effect of TGF-β1 was time dependent, evident after 3 days of the treatment, and maintained until day 7 ( Fig. 2C ). In the absence of TGF-β1, cells were reduced with 0.1–0.5% FCS after 3–5 days, and cell growth was almost stopped with 1% FCS over 3–7 days ( Fig. 2C ). However, in the presence of 2.5% FCS, ASM cells not only had a marked growth-stimulatory response to TGF-β1, but also kept an autonomous growth. Therefore, 2.5% FCS was chosen for subsequent studies. The effect of TGF-β1 on ASM cell growth was concentration-dependent over the range of 0.1–10 ng/ml with 2.5% FCS after 5 days of treatment ( Fig. 2D ).\nFig. 2.Stimulation of nonconfluent ASM cell growth by TGF-β1 in the presence of serum. A and B: image of ASM cells stained by crystal violet (A) and data from crystal violet assay (CVA) after nonconfluent ASM cells were incubated with 0.1–10% FCS in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 6 days (B). C: time-dependent stimulation by 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 with 0.1–10% FCS for 3–7 days. D: concentration-dependent stimulation by TGF-β1 (0.1–10 ng/ml) with 2.5% FCS for 5 days. Cell growth was assessed by CVA. Results are the means ± SD of triplicate measurements and representative from 3–5 ASM cell donors. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 compared with no TGF-β.\nDownload                 figure Download PowerPoint\nTGF-β1 stimulates nonconfluent ASM cell growth in serum-free medium.\nASM cells were incubated in 24-well plates with 10% FCS to 30% confluence and then treated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 in serum-free medium with 0.5% BSA. Cell growth was detected after 3–7 days of the treatment. TGF-β1 in the absence of serum induced a 30–40% growth stimulation after 5 days of treatment, and this was maintained until day 7 ( Fig. 3A ).\nFig. 3.Stimulation of nonconfluent and confluent ASM cell growth by TGF-β1 in the presence or absence of serum.

B: ASM cells were grown in 10% FCS/DMEM to confluence and then incubated in 0.5% BSA, 0.5% FCS, or 2.5% FCS/DMEM with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 2–6 days. Cell growth was assessed by CVA. Results are the means ± SD of triplicate measurements and representative from 3 ASM cell donors. The data are expressed as the percentage of the medium alone for B. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 compared with no TGF-β or medium alone.\nDownload                 figure Download PowerPoint\nTGF-β1 stimulates confluent ASM cell growth in the presence or absence of serum.\nWe next examined the effect of TGF-β1 on confluent ASM cells as most of the previous studies have been reported on confluent cells. ASM cells were grown in 24-well plates with 10% FCS to confluence and then exposed to 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 in the presence of 0.5% or 2.5% FCS or 0.5% BSA. Cell number was detected after 2–6 days of the treatment. There was 35–70% growth stimulation with 0.5% FCS, 35–50% with 0.5% BSA, and up to 25% with 2.5% FCS following 2–6 days of treatment ( Fig. 3B ). The stimulatory effect of TGF-β1 was almost negligible when ASM cells were too confluent such as after 6 days in 2.5% FCS/DMEM.\nMediation of TGF-β1-Induced ASM Cell Growth by TGF-β Receptor I Kinase and PI3K\nASM cells were grown in 24-well plates with 10% FCS to 30% confluence and were pretreated for 1 h with a selective inhibitor for either TβRI kinase, SD-208 (0.1–1 μM; Ref. 34 ), or for PI3K, LY-294002 (1–10 μM), in 2.5% FCS/DMEM and then cotreated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 6 days before detecting cell growth. Both SD-208 ( Fig. 4A ) and LY-294002 ( Fig. 4B ) induced a concentration-dependent inhibition in TGF-β1-stimulated cell growth. However, LY-294002 also inhibited autonomous growth at 10 μM, the highest concentration used.\nFig. 4.Inhibition of TGF-β1-stimulated ASM cell growth by TGF-β receptor I (TβRI) kinase blocker SD-208 (SD) and PI3K blocker LY-294002 (LY).

PD-98059 (1–50 μm) inhibited TGF-β1-induced growth in a dose-dependent manner with a significant effect at ≥10 μM ( Fig. 5A ). SP-600125 also inhibited the mitogenic activity of TGF-β1, but a significant effect was achieved at ≥25 μM ( Fig. 5B ). In contrast, SB-203580 induced a concentration-dependent increase in TGF-β1-stimulated cell growth with a 45% maximal enhancement ( Fig. 5C ). The IKK2 inhibitor, AS-602869, significantly inhibited the ASM cell growth by TGF-β1 at 2.5 μM ( Fig. 6A ). Dexamethasone (0.01–1 μM) downregulated TGF-β1-stimulated ASM cell growth down to 40% ( Fig. 6B ).\nFig. 5.Regulation of TGF-β1-stimulated ASM cell growth by MAPK inhibitors.

Cell growth was assessed after 4–6 days of the treatment with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) in fresh 2.5% FCS/DMEM ( Fig. 7A ). Transfection of Smad4, Smad7, or DNS3 did not affect the TGF-β1-stimulated ASM cell growth after 4 days of treatment ( Fig. 7A ). Similar results were seen after 6-day treatment with the growth factor (data not shown). To determine the efficacy of the transfection, we show that inhibition of Smad signaling by infection of cells with DNS3− or Smad7-expressing virus downregulated TGF-β1-induced CTGF protein expression, and enhancement of Smad signaling by introducing increasing amounts of adenovirus-mediated Smad4 into cells upregulated the CTGF expression as analyzed by Western blotting ( Fig. 7B ).\nFig. 7.Role of Smad pathway in TGF-β1-induced ASM cell growth and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression. ASM cells were infected with the adenoviruses expressing dominant-negative Smad3 (DNS3), Smad7, or Smad4 before treatment with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for 4 days to assess cell growth by CVA (A) or for 3 days to analyze CTGF protein expression by Western blotting (B).

This is also accompanied by an increase in TGF-β1 immunoreactive protein expression in asthmatic ASM. To elucidate the effect of TGF-β1 on ASM hyperplasia, we examined its activity on ASM cell proliferation. TGF-β1 stimulated ASM cell growth that is mediated through TβRI kinase and by the activation of a series of other kinases including PI3K, ERK, and JNK. Activation of p38 MAPK was associated with an inhibition of TGF-β1-induced growth. The mitogenic signaling of TGF-β1 also involved the inflammatory transcription factor, NF-κB, but is not dependent on the elements of Smad pathway.\nPrevious studies have reported conflicting effects of TGF-β1 on ASM cell proliferation ( 2 , 3 , 7 – 9 ), which may be related to different culture conditions used. Our study shows that TGF-β1 retains its proliferative effects under different culture conditions such as the degree of confluence or the presence of varying concentrations of FCS (0.1–5% FCS) or absence of serum without addition of any other growth factor or stimulator. Treatment of nonconfluent ASM cells with TGF-β1 stimulated a two- to fivefold increase in cell growth in the presence of 0.1–5% FCS, and the effect was time- and concentration-dependent. Our data support the study by Black et al. ( 2 ) who showed that TGF-β increased nonconfluent bovine ASM cell number in the presence of 2% FBS. TGF-β has also been reported to increase cell growth and DNA synthesis of confluent ASM cells at lower serum concentrations ( 7 ). We have shown that TGF-β1 stimulated up to 70% increase in confluent ASM cell growth with lower serum concentrations. The mitogenic effect of TGF-β1 on nonconfluent cells was greater than on confluent cells, which may be due to the higher growth rate of nonconfluent cells undergoing exponential growth; in addition, TGF-β released by nonconfluent ASM cells is much higher than confluent cells ( 10 ). TGF-β1 also stimulated nonconfluent and confluent ASM cell growth in serum-free medium as has been previously reported ( 7 , 25 ), but the activity is lower than that in serum-containing medium. Although the focus of this work is on hyperplasia, we also observed ASM hypertrophy when ASM cells were treated after 2–3 days in the absence of serum as has been recently reported ( 14 ).\nTGF-β signal transduction is first initiated by binding to two cell membrane serine-threonine kinase receptors, termed TβRI and TβRII, followed by their phosphorylation. Two TβRII subunits phosphorylate or activate two TβRI. TGF-β1-stimulated ASM cell growth is directly mediated by its receptor, as inhibition of TβRI kinase by SD-208 blocked the mitogenic effect of TGF-β1, indicating that the phosphorylation of TβRI by TGF-β1 is necessary for the mitogenic signaling. The Smad family of proteins are the primary substrates of the phosphorylated TβRI. Phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 leads to the formation of heteromeric complexes with Smad4. These complexes then translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene transcription by binding DNA directly or in association with other transcriptional factors, whereas Smad7 acts as negative regulator of the Smad signaling ( 24 ). The Smad pathway is involved in TGF-β-stimulated vascular SM cell growth ( 16 ) and mediates TGF-β-enhanced serum response factor-dependent transcription in ASM cells ( 4 ). We have previously shown that TGF-β1 induces Smad2/3 phosphorylation and CTGF expression in ASM cells ( 39 ), but, in the present study, inhibition of Smad signaling by the virus-mediated expression of DNS3 or Smad7 or activation through the expression of a constitutively active Smad4 did not affect TGF-β1-induced cell growth but regulated TGF-β1-induced CTGF expression. This indicates that TGF-β1-induced ASM cell growth is mediated through Smad-independent pathways. TGF-β has also been shown to activate p21-activated kinase-2 (PAK2) through Smad-independent signaling pathway in the growth-stimulated fibroblastic cells ( 37 ).\nEvidence from a previous report showed that TGF-β1 activates PI3K via its type I receptor ( 41 ) and that PI3K upregulates cyclin D1 expression in ASM cells ( 28 ) and mediates mitogen-induced ASM cell proliferation ( 18 ). We also found that PI3K is essential for both TGF-β1-induced and autonomous ASM cell growth because TGF-β1-stimulated ASM cell growth was completely inhibited by the PI3K blocker, LY-294002, which also decreased the autonomous cell growth. MAPK pathways have been implicated in both positive and negative regulation of TGF-β signaling ( 7 , 38 ). TGF-β induces the activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK pathways in ASM cells ( 7 ) possibly through the upstream mediators RhoA and Ras and via TGF-β-activated kinase ( 1 ). We showed that ERK and JNK pathways positively regulated TGF-β1-induced ASM cell growth as inhibition of these kinase activation by the specific inhibitors PD-98059 and SP-25600 downregulated the mitogenic activity of TGF-β1. ERK is a mitogenic signaling pathway for thrombin and basic FGF as well as TGF-β1 in ASM cells ( 7 , 30 ), and JNK has also been shown to mediate TGF-β1-induced expression of the target gene, CTGF, in ASM cells ( 39 ). Interestingly, inhibition of p38 MAPK activity by the specific inhibitor, SB-203580, enhanced TGF-β1-induced ASM cell growth, which may be associated with the observation that p38 MAPK negatively regulates cyclin D1 expression in ASM cells ( 27 ). On the other hand, ERK increased cyclin D1 expression in ASM cells ( 29 ), illustrating the differential involvement of the different MAPK pathways in TGF-β-induced growth regulation in ASM cells.\nTGF-β may activate the inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB ( 20 ), and TGF-β signaling has functional cooperation with NF-κB signaling ( 22 ). For the first time, we found that inhibition of NF-κB activation by the IKK2 inhibitor, AS-602869, significantly attenuated TGF-β1-stimulated cell growth, indicating that NF-κB signaling is required for the TGF-β1 mitogenic activity.\nCorticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs used for the treatment of asthma and inhibit mitogen-stimulated ASM cell proliferation ( 13 , 36 ). We observed marked downregulation of TGF-β1-stimulated ASM cell growth by the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, an effect that could occur through reduction of cyclin D1 levels and inhibition of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation ( 13 ). However, one of the mechanisms could be through the inhibition of NF-κB activation. Thus corticosteroid treatment may lead to inhibition of ASM hyperplasia in asthma, an effect that has yet to be confirmed in vivo in asthmatic patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids.\nIn conclusion, increased TGF-β1 expression is observed in ASM of patients with asthma. TGF-β1 induces ASM hyperplasia that is initially mediated by membrane TβR via TβRI phosphorylation and regulated positively by downstream kinases, PI3K, ERK, and JNK, and negatively by p38 MAPK. We also provide evidence that TGF-β1 mitogenic signaling is through NF-κB-dependent but Smad-independent pathways. We speculate that blockage of TGF-β1 activity or signaling may be a therapeutic strategy in asthma to inhibit ASM hyperplasia.\nGRANTS\n""","0.08514014","""http://www.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/ajplung.00068.2007""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

A. CARRILLO\nDepartament de Matemàtiques, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, 08193 Bellaterra, Spain\nJ. ROSADO\nReceived: 22 July 2009\nRevised: 12 April 2010\nWe present existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence results for some kinetic equations motivated by models for the collective behavior of large groups of individuals. Models of this kind have been recently proposed to study the behavior of large groups of animals, such as flocks of birds, swarms, or schools of fish. Our aim is to give a well-posedness theory for general models which possibly include a variety of effects: an interaction through a potential, such as a short-range repulsion and long-range attraction; a velocity-averaging effect where individuals try to adapt their own velocity to that of other individuals in their surroundings; and self-propulsion effects, which take into account effects on one individual that are independent of the others. We develop our theory in a space of measures, using mass transportation distances. As consequences of our theory, we show also the convergence of particle systems to their corresponding kinetic equations, and the local-in-time convergence to the hydrodynamic limit for one of the models.\nKeywords: Kinetic theory; measure solutions; interacting particle systems; Monge–Kantorovich–Rubinstein distance; stability; particle methods; swarming\nAMSC: 35B40, 82D99, 92D50\nCited by (80):\nYoung-Pil Choi , Samir Salem .

Different components in a vehicle have to constantly exchange available information with other vehicles on the road and cooperate for the purpose of ensuring safety and comfort using a Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET). Critical information like navigation, cooperative collision avoidance, lane-changing, speed limit, accident, obstacle or road condition warnings, etc. play a significant role for safety-related applications in VANET. Such kind of critical information gathering and dissemination is challenging, because of their delay-sensitive nature. This paper proposes an agent based model that consists of heavy-weight static cognitive (based on Belief Desire Intention : BDI) and light-weight mobile agents. Proposed model executes push (gather/store and disseminate) and pull (gather/store) operations on information gathered based on information relevance, criticalness and importance. The simulation results show that BDI based information gathering and dissemination scheme performs better than the reliable broadcast scheme in terms of bandwidth utilization, packet delivery ratio, push latency (information saturation time) and push/pull decision latency.\nKeywords\nVehicular ad hoc networks Cognitive agents BDI architecture \nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access\nPreview\nUnable to display preview.  Download preview PDF.\nReferences\n1.\nCaliskan, M., Mauve, M., Rech, B., & Luebke, A.

In this paper, detailed observations of an intriguing subglacial landform assemblage of ribbed moraines superimposed on glacial lineations on the Dubawnt Lake Ice Stream bed (north-west Canadian Shield) are presented, including their morphometry, internal structure (from ground penetrating radar (GPR) surveys and from glaciogeological analysis) and sedimentological characteristics (from sediment architecture and lithofacies analysis). The observations suggest an abrupt change in ice dynamics that correlates with two phases of glacial landform development. This hypothesis is based on evidence from a deformed lodgement till, which subsequently underwent brittle deformation and developed prominent thrust (shear) structures and tension fractures. Tension fractures are observed in a sediment exposure and thrust structures are observed in GPR surveys, where they occur most prominently in the ribbed moraine ridge crests. The presence of the fractures, and their association with a population of clasts in the till that are orientated with their a-axes transverse to the inferred ice flow direction, suggests a compressional flow regime. It is therefore inferred that the glacial lineations were formed under an extensional flow regime during ice stream activity, but that at some point patches of till under the ice stream stiffened through dewatering. The subsequent increase in basal shear stress resulted in compressional flow and the development of subglacial thrusting and the building of ribbed moraines. We therefore suggest that ribbed moraines may form in areas of compressional flow under ice streams, i.e. sticky spots, and/or at the transition between slow and fast ice flow along parts of an ice stream. The general absence of ribbed moraines on most other palaeo-ice-stream beds suggests that either these ice streams continued operating during deglaciation or processes other than the development of localized compressional flow (sticky spots) led to their shutdown (e.g. ice depletion).

This rise in interest is due to the enormous requirements of multi-domain earthquake rescue, pollution monitoring, natural species discovery and other applications in which multi-modal locomotion can offer unprecedented advantages to robot mobility. Swimming, crawling, rolling, walking, running, jumping and flying are quite common in the animal kingdom, and such locomotion occurs in very different physical environments. Interestingly, an animal may perform two or more modes of locomotion. For instance, turtles and salamanders can swim underwater and walk on land, while swans can swim and fly effectively. Their often remarkable abilities could inspire innovative designs to improve the way man-made systems operate in and interact with challenging outdoor environments consisting of multiple media.\nModes of locomotion in nature can be decomposed broadly into three categories: terrestrial, aerial and aquatic. There are situations in which the distinction between categories is vague, such as movement on the surface of water or in underground tunneling. However, generally, the types of locomotion used by animals can be categorized into one of these three areas.\nThe primary venue of locomotion for many animals tends to be mono-modal; the majority of their task-space demands only a singular modality, with minimal need of alternative morphologies for transportation. The fundamental reason for multi-modal animal locomotion is for survival. The need for these multiple modes can arise from different requirements related to survival, including fast escape, fast pursuit, searching for food, breeding, nesting, conserving energy and migration.\nMost phylogenetic lineages of organisms are conservative in terms of habitat use, but some groups display major shifts in this trait. Some of the most spectacular examples of such phylogenetic shifts involve the invasion of aquatic (especially marine) habitats by terrestrial taxa. Because of the very different physical properties of air and water, selective pressures for effective locomotion can generate massive morphological divergences. Shine and Shetty [ 1 ] discussed the aquatic and terrestrial locomotion by studying the data gathered on speeds of sea kraits in water and on land. Multiple invasions of oceanic habitats by terrestrial organisms thus provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the process of adaptation in general and the nature and magnitude of trade-offs involved in adaptive transitions between alternative modes of locomotion. As pointed out by Shine et al [ 2 ], amphibious animals may be subjected to strong but conflicting selective pressures to enhance locomotor performance both on land and in water. Biomechanical models suggest that in snakes, adaptations to swimming (e.g. reduction of ventral plates, flattening of tail) will reduce their ability to move on land.\nIt is impossible to simultaneously optimize performance in two tasks that require mutually incompatible morphologies or physiologies. In addition, conflicting optima can occur for many kinds of traits, but the easiest to study are those in which performance can be easily quantified and optima can be easily identified. Thus, the most clear-cut examples of trade-offs in locomotor performance involve species that move in highly contrasting ways such as running versus flying or swimming. The results showed that locomotor speeds of amphibious sea snakes vary among specie, differ between the sexes within species and change with body sizes. A snake's species and sex also affect its relative speed in terrestrial versus aquatic locomotion. In the paper by Shine et al each of these effects was examined with the aim of evaluating conclusions and predictions from an earlier study [ 1 ].\nAs highlighted by Marlene [ 3 ], animals' kinematic changes between air and water can be understood in terms of the mechanical loads characteristic of these different fluid environments. The increased buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces in water compared to those on land can cause a shift in the predominant destabilizing forces an animal experiences. An animal using pedestrian locomotion under water must contend with hydrodynamic forces that can prevent it from locomoting quickly or that can cause it to overturn or wash away. In addition to an animal's morphology, factors such as posture, behavior and water flow environment dramatically influence the hydrodynamic forces the animal experiences.\nIn another study of an animal's multi-modal locomotion, Marlene measured hydrodynamic forces on the amphibious shore crab Grapsus tenuicrustatus in aquatic and terrestrial postures. The amphibious shore crab changes body posture as well as kinematics, using a different locomotory gait on land than in water [ 4 ]. The crabs walk on land at slow speeds, but in water at these same speeds, the crabs use a more variable gait (submerged punting), characterized by alternating thrust generation and gliding. Due to the lower hydrodynamic forces in the aquatic posture, a crab could move up to 50% more quickly than it could in the terrestrial posture or through a faster water flow environment [ 5 ]. Marlene also found that in slower flow environments, animals can move faster and take advantage of different gaits that are not available to them in faster flow environments.\nA brief survey on the recent application works of hybrid and multi-modal locomotion is presented in the following sections.\n2. Hybrid air-water mobility\nCurrent Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are greatly limited by being able to operate in air only, preventing them from moving effectively on the ground or in water. Developing robots with hybrid air-water mobility would address the need for remote water sampling in inaccessible areas during disasters. Of particularly high importance is the detection of chemicals and biological contaminations in the sea, in coastal regions or in urban areas where humans are in contact with water. This is of paramount interest in disaster scenarios such as flooding situations, after chemical or nuclear accidents and during oil spills. Recent examples, such as the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil spill in 2010 or the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011, show the urgent need for remote sensing capability in hazardous situations to better react to emergencies and coordinate manned interventions.\nWhile some UAVs can land on water, no technology is available that would allow them to both dive and fly due to dramatic design trade-offs that have to be solved for movement in both air and water and due to the absence of high-power propulsion systems that would allow a transition from underwater to air. However, in nature a variety of animals are able to move in both air and water such as diving birds, flying squid and jumping fish. In the following sections, existing concepts of air-water mobility in robotics will be reviewed, and a summary of the design principles for the next generation of flying robots with hybrid mobility capabilities will be provided.\n3. Air-Water mobility in robotics\nOne of the main challenges in the design of aerial-aquatic vehicles includes the design of the mission profile. A variety of approaches can be taken to achieve aerial water sampling (figure 1 ). For example, a water sampling probe can be descended from a hovering UAV (figure 1 (A)) or a simple floating UAV (figures 1 (B) and (C)) might be used to land on the water surface and take a water sample. However, these concepts are inherently limited by either very short flight times or susceptibility to surface movement and by waves that can be detrimental to the operation of the UAV. Other concepts include dropping an underwater vehicle from the UAV (figure 1 (D)) for single-use missions or using the propellers to move underwater (figure 1 (E)), although the propellers that are used for flight are not adapted for underwater operation due to the different fluid properties. Looking at nature, a variety of solutions for air-water mobility has evolved, with several animals executing a plunge dive maneuver, i.e. drop-diving from air to water and transitioning back to flight directly from under the water's surface. This approach of dynamic air-water-air locomotion (figure 1 (F)), although a technically challenging solution, is very promising for high-frequency water sampling in cluttered and unpredictable terrain, with a high robustness to water waves and an avoidance of floating obstacles that would prevent hydroplane style landing and take-off.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 1. Aerial water sampling can be performed with a variety of mission profiles: (A) a probe is descended from a hovering UAV, (B) hovering UAV lands on the water's surface and floats due to buoyancy, (C) hydroplane landing of a fixed wing UAV, (D) UAV drops an underwater vehicle from flight, (E) multi-copter using its propellers to dive underwater and (F) UAV using its flight momentum to dive and transition back to flight.

Novel robotic technologies, fluid structure interaction principles and control methods need to be developed to enable the implementation of AquaMAVs. In efforts toward implementing AquaMAVs, studies have been conducted on the implementation of plunge diving capability in a flying vehicle [ 5 – 7 ], and Liang et al [ 7 ] have developed a testing platform able to fold its wings before diving into the water. However, these systems are currently experimental platforms and are not able to fully transition between air and water.\nPropulsion in both air and water has been studied in [ 8 – 10 ] using a flapping wing approach for diving-bird-inspired flapping flight. Using a hydroplane style surface landing approach, many existing robotic aerial vehicles use the water's surface as an extended runway. While none of these robots are able to operate beneath the surface, some systems deploy underwater vehicles from the air but are usually reliant on single-use, disposable equipment such as parachutes, airbags and disposable wings. However, the existence of demand for air launched underwater vehicles [ 11 ] is important nonetheless, and several military programs have attempted to create manned submersible aircraft [ 12 , 13 ]. A fully integrated AquaMAV would have the ability to be launched from underwater from an autonomous surface vessel as well as from the air, offering added mission capability to existing unmanned vehicle frameworks.\nAlthough several different approaches have been taken in the design of an aerial-aquatic vehicle, a fully functional AquaMAV has yet to be presented. Inspiration from biology, in combination with the best of robotic engineering and a thorough understanding of the fluid dynamics involved in the process, will be a key to achieving this objective and developing this next generation of UAV.\n4. Design principles for effective air-water mobility\nIn the animal kingdom, the combination of aerial with underwater locomotion is very prevalent, with several species able to transition between the two medium very effectively. Examples include flying fish, flying squid, diving birds and diving insects (figure 2 ) [ 15 ]. We have summarised the advantages and limitations of several animals and robots with aerial-aquatic capabilities in table 1 [ 15 ].\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 2. Strategies for aerial-aquatic locomotion [ 15 ]: (A) two stage transition: Flying Fish, (B) Hydroplaning: Ducks, (C) Jet propulsion: Flying Squid, (D) Plunge diving: Northern Gannet, (E) Morphing wings: Common Guillemot, (F) Foot propulsion: Great Diving Beetle.

In this process of biological inspiration it is important to adopt only the principles and not copy the exact morphology of the animals. To this end, we adopt the Inspire-Abstract-Implement paradigm for bioinspired robot design (figure 3 ) [ 14 ] that outlines how the successful robots can be built based on principles from biology.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 3. Inspire-Abstract-Implement bioinspired design paradigm [ 14 ] in which the bioinspired design process can be separated in three distinctive phases which integrate the abstraction of biological design principles with modern engineering tools.

Based on the analysis in table 1 , the most important principles are: (i) using jet propulsion, (ii) employing a wing folding mechanism and (iii) performing a plunge diving approach for the transition from air to water by using the flight momentum to move underwater.\nThe main challenge for the propulsion unit is achieving the very high power density required for take-off. For example, flying fish reach a speed underwater of around 20 body lengths per second. This performance is one order of magnitude higher than what has been achieved with swimming robots so far [ 15 ]. Moreover, miniaturisation of the mechanism would make it very difficult to build a vehicle at a very small size that requires a propulsion choice that can be fabricated across the range of AquaMAV sizes. An alternative and easily scalable propulsion approach is offered by water jet propulsion. Using pre-charged or locally generated pressure, scalable mechanisms can be designed to eject water, allowing for thrust in both water and air. In the animal kingdom, water jet propulsion is used by flying squid that can range from several centimeters to several meters in size, proving the utility and effectiveness of the approach. The first robotic implementations of the high-power water jet propulsion mechanisms are presented in [ 15 , 16 ].\nMost animals have a folding wing mechanism that offers protection for their often fragile wing structures. Folding wings are also used by many birds to actively modulate the wing shape to initiate and guide dynamic flight behaviours. All aerial-aquatic animals use some kind of folding wings. Most notably, flying fish and flying squid use them to sustain lift in air while having them shaped differently in water for efficient swimming. Gannets also fold their wings to reduce the impact forces on their body when diving through the water's surface, allowing them to reach depths easily. For AquaMAVs, using folding wings is likely a preferred choice to protect the wings from mechanical damage on impact, to use the flight momentum to dive deeply without needing underwater buoyancy control and to potentially use the folding wings for efficient dynamics in both air and water.\nAerial-aquatic mobility is the next step for flying robots to enable applications such as water sampling, oil spill response and underwater inspection. The challenges that need to be addressed in the development of these AquaMAVs include propulsion methods and wing folding principles and their integration with novel control approaches for operation in both air and water. Building on principles found in nature by diving birds and flying sea animals, we can develop AquaMAVs and advance the fields of mobile robotics.\n5. Recent works on land-water locomotion\nIn the field of hybrid or multi-modal locomotion, biologists and robotists have collaborated and achieved meaningful results. On one hand, biological emulation and investigation have inspired engineers and have been fused into implementing novel mechanisms and/or improving pre-existing prototype performance [ 40 – 42 ]. On the other hand, robotic prototypes have been developed to understand hybrid locomotion principles [ 10 , 43 – 57 ]. Experimental observation on multi-modal locomotion is often limited to the behaviors voluntarily executed by amphibious animals. Moreover, the measurement of biomechanics and dynamics on free locomotion is also a challenging task.\nTypical cases of multi-modal locomotion include swimming robots with walking and/or flying abilities within amphibious behaviors. Low et al [ 43 ] proposed and developed swimming and crawling gait and action patterns of an amphibious land-water robot inspired by sea turtles, as depicted in figure 4 . Ijspeert et al [ 48 , 56 ] focused on using robotic models to understand behaviors of amphibious salamanders, as shown in figure 5 . The transition from aquatic to terrestrial locomotion was implemented and further understood using a neural central pattern generator (CPG) control scheme in the vertebrate multi-modal robotic prototype. Furthermore, a CPG control architecture was developed for controlling the hybrid locomotion of an amphibious snake/lamprey robot capable of swimming and serpentine locomotion. Yu et al [ 46 ] proposed and implemented a versatile amphibious robot, AmphiRobot-II, inspired by various amphibian principles in the animal kingdom. A novel hybrid propulsive mechanism coupled with wheel-propeller-fin movements was proposed that integrates fish- or dolphin-like swimming and wheel-based crawling. The robot is not only able to implement flexible wheel-based movements on land but is also able to perform steady and efficient fish- or dolphin-like swimming under water. Furthermore, it can switch between these two patterns via a specialized swivel device.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 4. Land-Water amphibian robot inspired by turtles [ 43 ]: (A) swimming and crawling turtles, (B) Crawling gait of a sea turtle, (C) Crawling gait of a turtle-inspired robot and (D) Swimming gait of a turtle-inspired robot.

Some of these robots achieve these tasks through multiple locomotion modes as shown by animals [ 49 , 56 , 58 , 59 ]. Multi-modal locomotion, particularly that of the multi-legged robotics, has recently gained increasing interest due to its ability to achieve natural interaction between the mechanical dynamics of the robot and the environment. Locomotion dynamics are the result of interactions between a particular internal control structure, the mechanical dynamics of the robot's body and the environment [ 60 , 61 ]. In addition to low-power systems and portability, which are vital challenges that substantially limit any successful biorobotic-based application, the proposed paradigms should also take into account issues related to scalability and security.\n6. Works related to air-ground locomotion\nIn nature, many animals that can fly can also move on ground effectively by either walking, crawling or jumping. Walking birds or insects are examples of this faculty, offering precise ground locomotion to the animal in addition to its flying capacity. There are some animals that use their ground mobility as a way to transition from ground to air, e.g. by jumping, which is then followed by gliding flight. Examples of such jump-gliding animals include gliding lizards, locusts, gliding geckos, gliding ants, spiders, gliding frogs, jumping bats, gliding mammals, gliding snakes and many birds (figure 6 ) [ 62 ]. Jumping and gliding can also be found amongst extinct species, such as the Sharovipteryx, and amongst some lizard-like reptiles with similar wings to that of the Draco lizard. Although all of these animals have very different body morphologies, they have converged in their evolution by adopting a hybrid jumping and gliding locomotion strategy. As the focus of this article is of a technological nature, the reader may refer to [ 63 – 65 ] for in-depth reviews of jump-gliding animals, with detailed descriptions of morphology and behavior.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 6. A selection of animals that use gliding as part of their locomotion strategy [ 62 ].

A related class of mobile robots includes propeller or flapping-wing-propelled vehicles that have added ground mobility [ 66 , 68 ] using legs or whegs (figures 7 (E) and (F)). These hybrid robots offer proof-of-concept implementation of multi-modal mobility for aerial vehicles, and they demonstrate the potential of combining ground and aerial locomotion. However, the field on multi-modal mobility is still at its early stages, and there are many unexplored avenues on how to combine aerial with ground and aquatic locomotion. Challenges include actuation, materials, propulsion, control and system integration. Thus, this field offers a wide range of possible research topics. Biological inspiration and creative design beyond the commonly employed airframes and control schemes will be a key in the development of these next-generation multi-modal robots.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 7. Air-Ground robots: (A) UC Berkeley Wing assisted running reproduced with permission from [ 68 ], (B) Stanford jumpglider reproduced with permission from [ 69 ], (C) EPFL jumpglider reproduced with permission from [ 70 ], (D) CMU MultiMo-Bat [ 70 ], (E) U.

Recent advances in biorobotics have helped bridge the gap between robotists and biologists; thus, recent mechatronic systems and robots are controlled in a way that reflects better understanding of complex living organisms.\nThe IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Technical Advisory Committee on BioRobotics organized a workshop on 'Biologically inspired based strategies for hybrid and multi-modal locomotion', in conjunction with the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) that was held at Tokyo Big Sight, Japan on November 3–7, 2013. The aim of the workshop was to explore and tackle the challenges of applying biologically-based concepts to robots in order to improve the robotic capabilities. The specific focus was on hybrid and multi-modal locomotion in air, water and/or on land.\nThe IROS 2013 Workshop consisted of four sessions: multi-modal ground robots, multi-modal locomotion dynamics, swimming and amphibian robots and multi-modal aerial robots. Four keynote speakers and several others were invited to present their work on the relevant fields. All scientists who presented their work at the workshop were invited to submit their work for review and possible publication in Bioinspiration & Biomimetics.\nIn this special issue, seven distinguished research teams with biology and engineering backgrounds present their ideas and works to fuse biological inspirations into robotic hybrid locomotion. Among the seven papers, one paper is concerned with the flapping wings inspired by bat and bird morphology, another paper focuses on a bioinspired underwater robot, four papers consider bioinspired land robots in different locomotion modalities and modes and one paper is devoted to the formulation schemes of bioinspired locomotion by virtue of multibody systems dynamics.\nIn the first paper, Stowers and Lentink present a new mechanism for passive wing morphing of flapping wings inspired by bats and birds. The mechanism consists of an unactuated hand wing connected to the arm wing with a wrist joint. To better understand the passive dynamics, a computer model of the unfolding process was constructed using rigid body dynamics, contact models and aerodynamic correlations. This model predicts the measured passive unfolding within about one flap and shows that unfolding is driven by centrifugal acceleration induced by flapping. These simulations indicate that unfolding is dominated by centrifugal accelerations induced by wing flapping rather than aerodynamic or gravitational forces. Finally, it is experimentally shown that passive unfolding wings can withstand impact with a branch by first folding and then unfolding passively. This mechanism enables flapping robots to squeeze through clutter without complex control. Experiments suggest that friction in the hinge should be minimized to the largest extent possible. The predicted unfold time based solely on centrifugal acceleration is on the order of one wingbeat and can be as short as half a wingbeat. This insight, corroborated from the theoretical, numerical and physical analysis of a flapping folding wing, provides new research avenues for the functional interpretation of the muscle groups that control vertebrate hand and arm wings.\nBioinspired sensing modalities enhance the ability of autonomous vehicles to characterize and respond to their environment. The paper by DeVries et al describes the design and implementation of a multi-modal artificial lateral line for flow sensing and feedback control of an underwater vehicle. By employing an artificial lateral line, the performance of underwater sensing and navigation strategies is improved in dark, cluttered or murky environments where traditional sensing modalities may be hindered. The estimation and control strategies enable an airfoil-shaped unmanned underwater vehicle to assimilate measurements from a bioinspired, multi-modal artificial lateral line and to estimate flow properties for feedback control. The robotic prototype outfitted with a multi-modal artificial lateral line composed of an ionic polymer metal composite and of embedded pressure sensors experimentally demonstrates the distributed flow sensing and closed-loop control strategies.\nInspired by observations from a biological runner, the paper by Park and Kim presents a bioinspired quadruped controller that allows variable-speed galloping. The developed controller estimates the required vertical impulse at each stride by applying the linear momentum conservation principle in the vertical direction and prescribes the ground reaction forces at each stride. Based on a biological observation, a new control design scheme is proposed for high-speed galloping in the MIT Cheetah 2 robot. Quadrupedal animals increase the vertical impulse that is generated by ground reaction forces at each stride as running speed increases and as the duration of each stance phase is reduced, whereas the swing phase stays relatively constant. Based on a biological observation, a new control design scheme is proposed for high-speed galloping in the MIT Cheetah 2 robot. A stable 3D galloping controller is currently applied to the MIT Cheetah 2 robot and will be implemented in indoor running of the robot.\nOne of the most significant challenges in bioinspired robotics is determining how to make use of multi-modal locomotion to help robots perform a variety of tasks adaptively in different environments. In order to address the challenge properly, it is important to understand that locomotion dynamics are the result of interactions between a particular internal control structure, the mechanical dynamics and the environment. The fourth paper by Nurzaman, Kim and Lida presents an approach to enable a robot to take advantage of its multiple locomotion modes by coupling the mechanical dynamics of the robot with an internal control structure known as an attractor selection model. The robot considered is a curved-beam hopping robot that possesses rich and complex mechanical dynamics that are dependent on its interactions with the environment. Through dynamical coupling, the robot performs goal-directed locomotion by gracefully shifting between different locomotion modes regulated by sensory input, the robot's mechanical dynamics and an internally generated perturbation. The coupling between the mechanical dynamics and the attractor selection mechanism enables the robot to take advantage of the different locomotion modes to bring itself toward the goal. The approach was also implemented in a real robot, enabling it to perform goal-directed locomotion based on the same principle.\nAnimals have demonstrated the ability to move through, across and over some of the most daunting environments on earth. This versatility and adaptability stems from their capacity to alter their locomotion dynamics and employ disparate locomotion modalities to suit various terrains. Dynamic climbing is commonly employed by legged animals, allowing for rapid and robust locomotion on vertical and near-vertical substrates. The paper by Miller et al presents a biologically-inspired model for dynamic climbing that captures the underlying pendular motion observed in studies of cockroaches and geckos running on vertical surfaces. This model was inspired from observations of similar gait characteristics in the dynamics of rapidly climbing cockroaches and geckos. This paper investigated several of these factors and proposed policies and methodologies to improve performance and reliability on both dedicated climbers and multi-modal systems.\nRecent works suggest that jumping locomotion in combination with a gliding phase can be used as an effective mobility principle in robotics. The paper by Vidyasagar et al evaluated the performance of jump-gliding locomotion and provides models for the relevant dynamics of flight. It also defines a jump-gliding envelope that encompasses the range that can be achieved with jump-gliding mobility and that can then be used to evaluate the performance and improvement potential of jump-gliding robots. In order to validate the prediction of these models, a jump-gliding robot, named the 'EPFL jump-glider', has been tested in experiments to perform jumps from elevated positions, to perform steered gliding flight, to land safely from considerable heights and to move on ground by repetitive jumping.\nThe last article of the special issue by Boyer and Porez developed a set of generic tools for multibody systems dynamics devoted to the study of bioinspired locomotion in robotics. In considering a general problem of locomotion, they progressively drew a unified geometric picture of locomotion dynamics, starting from the model of discrete mobile multibody systems, followed by the case of continuous and finally soft systems. Starting from animals before moving on to robots, it is shown that there is a need to develop methodological tools for designing, modeling, control and motion planning of a new generation of robots with multi-degrees of freedom. The paper also addresses the practical problem of the efficient computation of these models by proposing a Newton-Euler-based approach to efficient locomotion dynamics, with a few illustrations of creeping, swimming and flying. The authors discovered that behind their apparent diversity, many locomotion modes share common geometric structures.\n8. Concluding remarks\nAs discussed in this article and covered by the papers in this special issue, various modes of locomotion that can be adopted by different genus groups in multiple media are investigated to understand the compromise in ability adopted by the animals when achieving multi-modal locomotion.\nConsidering all of the natural examples shown for aerial, aquatic and/or terrestrial operations, it would appear that using distinct locomotive mechanisms for multi-modal operations of this type is advantageous. This is true for both birds and insects, with birds having the advantage of higher feasible scalability of functions. More experimental works would be required to determine if the terrestrial ability has led to a decrease in aerial ability within a specific species.\nMany different types of locomotion are used across the biological classes, but it should be noted that each has a varying level of competence within the substrate, and as such, careful consideration must be given before assuming that mimicking the animal's techniques will provide the most suitable combination for real-world engineering problems [ 40 , 48 , 60 , 72 – 74 ].\nIn the near future, much closer biologist-and-robotist collaboration will still be an important step for developing multi-modal locomotion. More innovative biorobots are to be developed to emulate and investigate hybrid locomotion since man-made prototypes outperform repetitive behaviors and influential factor isolation when compared to animals. Biomechanics on transition among jumping, walking, running, rolling, crawling, swimming and/or flying should be focused on. Agile movements of animals should be further understood in principles of their central and peripheral nervous systems as well as their musculoskeletal system. Certainly, their adaptation to varying environments is also a really interesting and inspiring component. Furthermore, inspiration from emulating or understanding multi-modal locomotion should promote robotics performance and enable more practical applications. Smart materials, flexible mechanisms and advanced control strategies are essential to realize the enormous potentials in industrial, educational, common-health, security-related, home-service and special fields of robotics.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank the authors for their exciting contributions to this special issue.

The goal of our work is to increase the usability of such solar-powered robotic aircraft by maximizing their perpetual flight robustness to meteorological deteriorations such as clouds or winds. We present energetic system models and a design methodology, implement them in our publicly available conceptual design framework for perpetual flight-capable solar-powered UAVs, and finally apply the framework to the AtlantikSolar UAV. We present the detailed AtlantikSolar characteristics as a practical design example. Airframe, avionics, hardware, state estimation, and control method development for autonomous flight operations are described. Flight data are used to validate the conceptual design framework. Flight results from the continuous 81-hour and 2,338 km covered ground distance flight show that AtlantikSolar achieves 39% minimum state-of-charge, 6.8 h excess time and 6.2 h charge margin. These performance metrics are a significant improvement over previous solar-powered UAVs. A performance outlook shows that AtlantikSolar allows perpetual flight in a 6-month window around June 21 at mid-European latitudes, and that multi-day flights with small optical- or infrared-camera payloads are possible for the first time. The demonstrated performance represents the current state-of-the-art in solar-powered low-altitude perpetual flight performance. We conclude with lessons learned from the three-year AtlantikSolar UAV development process and with a sensitivity analysis that identifies the most promising technological areas for future solar-powered UAV performance improvements.\n""","0.30854988","""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rob.21717/abstract""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

This rise in interest is due to the enormous requirements of multi-domain earthquake rescue, pollution monitoring, natural species discovery and other applications in which multi-modal locomotion can offer unprecedented advantages to robot mobility. Swimming, crawling, rolling, walking, running, jumping and flying are quite common in the animal kingdom, and such locomotion occurs in very different physical environments. Interestingly, an animal may perform two or more modes of locomotion. For instance, turtles and salamanders can swim underwater and walk on land, while swans can swim and fly effectively. Their often remarkable abilities could inspire innovative designs to improve the way man-made systems operate in and interact with challenging outdoor environments consisting of multiple media.\nModes of locomotion in nature can be decomposed broadly into three categories: terrestrial, aerial and aquatic. There are situations in which the distinction between categories is vague, such as movement on the surface of water or in underground tunneling. However, generally, the types of locomotion used by animals can be categorized into one of these three areas.\nThe primary venue of locomotion for many animals tends to be mono-modal; the majority of their task-space demands only a singular modality, with minimal need of alternative morphologies for transportation. The fundamental reason for multi-modal animal locomotion is for survival. The need for these multiple modes can arise from different requirements related to survival, including fast escape, fast pursuit, searching for food, breeding, nesting, conserving energy and migration.\nMost phylogenetic lineages of organisms are conservative in terms of habitat use, but some groups display major shifts in this trait. Some of the most spectacular examples of such phylogenetic shifts involve the invasion of aquatic (especially marine) habitats by terrestrial taxa. Because of the very different physical properties of air and water, selective pressures for effective locomotion can generate massive morphological divergences. Shine and Shetty [ 1 ] discussed the aquatic and terrestrial locomotion by studying the data gathered on speeds of sea kraits in water and on land. Multiple invasions of oceanic habitats by terrestrial organisms thus provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the process of adaptation in general and the nature and magnitude of trade-offs involved in adaptive transitions between alternative modes of locomotion. As pointed out by Shine et al [ 2 ], amphibious animals may be subjected to strong but conflicting selective pressures to enhance locomotor performance both on land and in water. Biomechanical models suggest that in snakes, adaptations to swimming (e.g. reduction of ventral plates, flattening of tail) will reduce their ability to move on land.\nIt is impossible to simultaneously optimize performance in two tasks that require mutually incompatible morphologies or physiologies. In addition, conflicting optima can occur for many kinds of traits, but the easiest to study are those in which performance can be easily quantified and optima can be easily identified. Thus, the most clear-cut examples of trade-offs in locomotor performance involve species that move in highly contrasting ways such as running versus flying or swimming. The results showed that locomotor speeds of amphibious sea snakes vary among specie, differ between the sexes within species and change with body sizes. A snake's species and sex also affect its relative speed in terrestrial versus aquatic locomotion. In the paper by Shine et al each of these effects was examined with the aim of evaluating conclusions and predictions from an earlier study [ 1 ].\nAs highlighted by Marlene [ 3 ], animals' kinematic changes between air and water can be understood in terms of the mechanical loads characteristic of these different fluid environments. The increased buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces in water compared to those on land can cause a shift in the predominant destabilizing forces an animal experiences. An animal using pedestrian locomotion under water must contend with hydrodynamic forces that can prevent it from locomoting quickly or that can cause it to overturn or wash away. In addition to an animal's morphology, factors such as posture, behavior and water flow environment dramatically influence the hydrodynamic forces the animal experiences.\nIn another study of an animal's multi-modal locomotion, Marlene measured hydrodynamic forces on the amphibious shore crab Grapsus tenuicrustatus in aquatic and terrestrial postures. The amphibious shore crab changes body posture as well as kinematics, using a different locomotory gait on land than in water [ 4 ]. The crabs walk on land at slow speeds, but in water at these same speeds, the crabs use a more variable gait (submerged punting), characterized by alternating thrust generation and gliding. Due to the lower hydrodynamic forces in the aquatic posture, a crab could move up to 50% more quickly than it could in the terrestrial posture or through a faster water flow environment [ 5 ]. Marlene also found that in slower flow environments, animals can move faster and take advantage of different gaits that are not available to them in faster flow environments.\nA brief survey on the recent application works of hybrid and multi-modal locomotion is presented in the following sections.\n2. Hybrid air-water mobility\nCurrent Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are greatly limited by being able to operate in air only, preventing them from moving effectively on the ground or in water. Developing robots with hybrid air-water mobility would address the need for remote water sampling in inaccessible areas during disasters. Of particularly high importance is the detection of chemicals and biological contaminations in the sea, in coastal regions or in urban areas where humans are in contact with water. This is of paramount interest in disaster scenarios such as flooding situations, after chemical or nuclear accidents and during oil spills. Recent examples, such as the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil spill in 2010 or the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011, show the urgent need for remote sensing capability in hazardous situations to better react to emergencies and coordinate manned interventions.\nWhile some UAVs can land on water, no technology is available that would allow them to both dive and fly due to dramatic design trade-offs that have to be solved for movement in both air and water and due to the absence of high-power propulsion systems that would allow a transition from underwater to air. However, in nature a variety of animals are able to move in both air and water such as diving birds, flying squid and jumping fish. In the following sections, existing concepts of air-water mobility in robotics will be reviewed, and a summary of the design principles for the next generation of flying robots with hybrid mobility capabilities will be provided.\n3. Air-Water mobility in robotics\nOne of the main challenges in the design of aerial-aquatic vehicles includes the design of the mission profile. A variety of approaches can be taken to achieve aerial water sampling (figure 1 ). For example, a water sampling probe can be descended from a hovering UAV (figure 1 (A)) or a simple floating UAV (figures 1 (B) and (C)) might be used to land on the water surface and take a water sample. However, these concepts are inherently limited by either very short flight times or susceptibility to surface movement and by waves that can be detrimental to the operation of the UAV. Other concepts include dropping an underwater vehicle from the UAV (figure 1 (D)) for single-use missions or using the propellers to move underwater (figure 1 (E)), although the propellers that are used for flight are not adapted for underwater operation due to the different fluid properties. Looking at nature, a variety of solutions for air-water mobility has evolved, with several animals executing a plunge dive maneuver, i.e. drop-diving from air to water and transitioning back to flight directly from under the water's surface. This approach of dynamic air-water-air locomotion (figure 1 (F)), although a technically challenging solution, is very promising for high-frequency water sampling in cluttered and unpredictable terrain, with a high robustness to water waves and an avoidance of floating obstacles that would prevent hydroplane style landing and take-off.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 1. Aerial water sampling can be performed with a variety of mission profiles: (A) a probe is descended from a hovering UAV, (B) hovering UAV lands on the water's surface and floats due to buoyancy, (C) hydroplane landing of a fixed wing UAV, (D) UAV drops an underwater vehicle from flight, (E) multi-copter using its propellers to dive underwater and (F) UAV using its flight momentum to dive and transition back to flight.

Novel robotic technologies, fluid structure interaction principles and control methods need to be developed to enable the implementation of AquaMAVs. In efforts toward implementing AquaMAVs, studies have been conducted on the implementation of plunge diving capability in a flying vehicle [ 5 – 7 ], and Liang et al [ 7 ] have developed a testing platform able to fold its wings before diving into the water. However, these systems are currently experimental platforms and are not able to fully transition between air and water.\nPropulsion in both air and water has been studied in [ 8 – 10 ] using a flapping wing approach for diving-bird-inspired flapping flight. Using a hydroplane style surface landing approach, many existing robotic aerial vehicles use the water's surface as an extended runway. While none of these robots are able to operate beneath the surface, some systems deploy underwater vehicles from the air but are usually reliant on single-use, disposable equipment such as parachutes, airbags and disposable wings. However, the existence of demand for air launched underwater vehicles [ 11 ] is important nonetheless, and several military programs have attempted to create manned submersible aircraft [ 12 , 13 ]. A fully integrated AquaMAV would have the ability to be launched from underwater from an autonomous surface vessel as well as from the air, offering added mission capability to existing unmanned vehicle frameworks.\nAlthough several different approaches have been taken in the design of an aerial-aquatic vehicle, a fully functional AquaMAV has yet to be presented. Inspiration from biology, in combination with the best of robotic engineering and a thorough understanding of the fluid dynamics involved in the process, will be a key to achieving this objective and developing this next generation of UAV.\n4. Design principles for effective air-water mobility\nIn the animal kingdom, the combination of aerial with underwater locomotion is very prevalent, with several species able to transition between the two medium very effectively. Examples include flying fish, flying squid, diving birds and diving insects (figure 2 ) [ 15 ]. We have summarised the advantages and limitations of several animals and robots with aerial-aquatic capabilities in table 1 [ 15 ].\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 2. Strategies for aerial-aquatic locomotion [ 15 ]: (A) two stage transition: Flying Fish, (B) Hydroplaning: Ducks, (C) Jet propulsion: Flying Squid, (D) Plunge diving: Northern Gannet, (E) Morphing wings: Common Guillemot, (F) Foot propulsion: Great Diving Beetle.

In this process of biological inspiration it is important to adopt only the principles and not copy the exact morphology of the animals. To this end, we adopt the Inspire-Abstract-Implement paradigm for bioinspired robot design (figure 3 ) [ 14 ] that outlines how the successful robots can be built based on principles from biology.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 3. Inspire-Abstract-Implement bioinspired design paradigm [ 14 ] in which the bioinspired design process can be separated in three distinctive phases which integrate the abstraction of biological design principles with modern engineering tools.

Based on the analysis in table 1 , the most important principles are: (i) using jet propulsion, (ii) employing a wing folding mechanism and (iii) performing a plunge diving approach for the transition from air to water by using the flight momentum to move underwater.\nThe main challenge for the propulsion unit is achieving the very high power density required for take-off. For example, flying fish reach a speed underwater of around 20 body lengths per second. This performance is one order of magnitude higher than what has been achieved with swimming robots so far [ 15 ]. Moreover, miniaturisation of the mechanism would make it very difficult to build a vehicle at a very small size that requires a propulsion choice that can be fabricated across the range of AquaMAV sizes. An alternative and easily scalable propulsion approach is offered by water jet propulsion. Using pre-charged or locally generated pressure, scalable mechanisms can be designed to eject water, allowing for thrust in both water and air. In the animal kingdom, water jet propulsion is used by flying squid that can range from several centimeters to several meters in size, proving the utility and effectiveness of the approach. The first robotic implementations of the high-power water jet propulsion mechanisms are presented in [ 15 , 16 ].\nMost animals have a folding wing mechanism that offers protection for their often fragile wing structures. Folding wings are also used by many birds to actively modulate the wing shape to initiate and guide dynamic flight behaviours. All aerial-aquatic animals use some kind of folding wings. Most notably, flying fish and flying squid use them to sustain lift in air while having them shaped differently in water for efficient swimming. Gannets also fold their wings to reduce the impact forces on their body when diving through the water's surface, allowing them to reach depths easily. For AquaMAVs, using folding wings is likely a preferred choice to protect the wings from mechanical damage on impact, to use the flight momentum to dive deeply without needing underwater buoyancy control and to potentially use the folding wings for efficient dynamics in both air and water.\nAerial-aquatic mobility is the next step for flying robots to enable applications such as water sampling, oil spill response and underwater inspection. The challenges that need to be addressed in the development of these AquaMAVs include propulsion methods and wing folding principles and their integration with novel control approaches for operation in both air and water. Building on principles found in nature by diving birds and flying sea animals, we can develop AquaMAVs and advance the fields of mobile robotics.\n5. Recent works on land-water locomotion\nIn the field of hybrid or multi-modal locomotion, biologists and robotists have collaborated and achieved meaningful results. On one hand, biological emulation and investigation have inspired engineers and have been fused into implementing novel mechanisms and/or improving pre-existing prototype performance [ 40 – 42 ]. On the other hand, robotic prototypes have been developed to understand hybrid locomotion principles [ 10 , 43 – 57 ]. Experimental observation on multi-modal locomotion is often limited to the behaviors voluntarily executed by amphibious animals. Moreover, the measurement of biomechanics and dynamics on free locomotion is also a challenging task.\nTypical cases of multi-modal locomotion include swimming robots with walking and/or flying abilities within amphibious behaviors. Low et al [ 43 ] proposed and developed swimming and crawling gait and action patterns of an amphibious land-water robot inspired by sea turtles, as depicted in figure 4 . Ijspeert et al [ 48 , 56 ] focused on using robotic models to understand behaviors of amphibious salamanders, as shown in figure 5 . The transition from aquatic to terrestrial locomotion was implemented and further understood using a neural central pattern generator (CPG) control scheme in the vertebrate multi-modal robotic prototype. Furthermore, a CPG control architecture was developed for controlling the hybrid locomotion of an amphibious snake/lamprey robot capable of swimming and serpentine locomotion. Yu et al [ 46 ] proposed and implemented a versatile amphibious robot, AmphiRobot-II, inspired by various amphibian principles in the animal kingdom. A novel hybrid propulsive mechanism coupled with wheel-propeller-fin movements was proposed that integrates fish- or dolphin-like swimming and wheel-based crawling. The robot is not only able to implement flexible wheel-based movements on land but is also able to perform steady and efficient fish- or dolphin-like swimming under water. Furthermore, it can switch between these two patterns via a specialized swivel device.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 4. Land-Water amphibian robot inspired by turtles [ 43 ]: (A) swimming and crawling turtles, (B) Crawling gait of a sea turtle, (C) Crawling gait of a turtle-inspired robot and (D) Swimming gait of a turtle-inspired robot.

Some of these robots achieve these tasks through multiple locomotion modes as shown by animals [ 49 , 56 , 58 , 59 ]. Multi-modal locomotion, particularly that of the multi-legged robotics, has recently gained increasing interest due to its ability to achieve natural interaction between the mechanical dynamics of the robot and the environment. Locomotion dynamics are the result of interactions between a particular internal control structure, the mechanical dynamics of the robot's body and the environment [ 60 , 61 ]. In addition to low-power systems and portability, which are vital challenges that substantially limit any successful biorobotic-based application, the proposed paradigms should also take into account issues related to scalability and security.\n6. Works related to air-ground locomotion\nIn nature, many animals that can fly can also move on ground effectively by either walking, crawling or jumping. Walking birds or insects are examples of this faculty, offering precise ground locomotion to the animal in addition to its flying capacity. There are some animals that use their ground mobility as a way to transition from ground to air, e.g. by jumping, which is then followed by gliding flight. Examples of such jump-gliding animals include gliding lizards, locusts, gliding geckos, gliding ants, spiders, gliding frogs, jumping bats, gliding mammals, gliding snakes and many birds (figure 6 ) [ 62 ]. Jumping and gliding can also be found amongst extinct species, such as the Sharovipteryx, and amongst some lizard-like reptiles with similar wings to that of the Draco lizard. Although all of these animals have very different body morphologies, they have converged in their evolution by adopting a hybrid jumping and gliding locomotion strategy. As the focus of this article is of a technological nature, the reader may refer to [ 63 – 65 ] for in-depth reviews of jump-gliding animals, with detailed descriptions of morphology and behavior.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 6. A selection of animals that use gliding as part of their locomotion strategy [ 62 ].

A related class of mobile robots includes propeller or flapping-wing-propelled vehicles that have added ground mobility [ 66 , 68 ] using legs or whegs (figures 7 (E) and (F)). These hybrid robots offer proof-of-concept implementation of multi-modal mobility for aerial vehicles, and they demonstrate the potential of combining ground and aerial locomotion. However, the field on multi-modal mobility is still at its early stages, and there are many unexplored avenues on how to combine aerial with ground and aquatic locomotion. Challenges include actuation, materials, propulsion, control and system integration. Thus, this field offers a wide range of possible research topics. Biological inspiration and creative design beyond the commonly employed airframes and control schemes will be a key in the development of these next-generation multi-modal robots.\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nReset image size\nFigure 7. Air-Ground robots: (A) UC Berkeley Wing assisted running reproduced with permission from [ 68 ], (B) Stanford jumpglider reproduced with permission from [ 69 ], (C) EPFL jumpglider reproduced with permission from [ 70 ], (D) CMU MultiMo-Bat [ 70 ], (E) U.

Recent advances in biorobotics have helped bridge the gap between robotists and biologists; thus, recent mechatronic systems and robots are controlled in a way that reflects better understanding of complex living organisms.\nThe IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Technical Advisory Committee on BioRobotics organized a workshop on 'Biologically inspired based strategies for hybrid and multi-modal locomotion', in conjunction with the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) that was held at Tokyo Big Sight, Japan on November 3–7, 2013. The aim of the workshop was to explore and tackle the challenges of applying biologically-based concepts to robots in order to improve the robotic capabilities. The specific focus was on hybrid and multi-modal locomotion in air, water and/or on land.\nThe IROS 2013 Workshop consisted of four sessions: multi-modal ground robots, multi-modal locomotion dynamics, swimming and amphibian robots and multi-modal aerial robots. Four keynote speakers and several others were invited to present their work on the relevant fields. All scientists who presented their work at the workshop were invited to submit their work for review and possible publication in Bioinspiration & Biomimetics.\nIn this special issue, seven distinguished research teams with biology and engineering backgrounds present their ideas and works to fuse biological inspirations into robotic hybrid locomotion. Among the seven papers, one paper is concerned with the flapping wings inspired by bat and bird morphology, another paper focuses on a bioinspired underwater robot, four papers consider bioinspired land robots in different locomotion modalities and modes and one paper is devoted to the formulation schemes of bioinspired locomotion by virtue of multibody systems dynamics.\nIn the first paper, Stowers and Lentink present a new mechanism for passive wing morphing of flapping wings inspired by bats and birds. The mechanism consists of an unactuated hand wing connected to the arm wing with a wrist joint. To better understand the passive dynamics, a computer model of the unfolding process was constructed using rigid body dynamics, contact models and aerodynamic correlations. This model predicts the measured passive unfolding within about one flap and shows that unfolding is driven by centrifugal acceleration induced by flapping. These simulations indicate that unfolding is dominated by centrifugal accelerations induced by wing flapping rather than aerodynamic or gravitational forces. Finally, it is experimentally shown that passive unfolding wings can withstand impact with a branch by first folding and then unfolding passively. This mechanism enables flapping robots to squeeze through clutter without complex control. Experiments suggest that friction in the hinge should be minimized to the largest extent possible. The predicted unfold time based solely on centrifugal acceleration is on the order of one wingbeat and can be as short as half a wingbeat. This insight, corroborated from the theoretical, numerical and physical analysis of a flapping folding wing, provides new research avenues for the functional interpretation of the muscle groups that control vertebrate hand and arm wings.\nBioinspired sensing modalities enhance the ability of autonomous vehicles to characterize and respond to their environment. The paper by DeVries et al describes the design and implementation of a multi-modal artificial lateral line for flow sensing and feedback control of an underwater vehicle. By employing an artificial lateral line, the performance of underwater sensing and navigation strategies is improved in dark, cluttered or murky environments where traditional sensing modalities may be hindered. The estimation and control strategies enable an airfoil-shaped unmanned underwater vehicle to assimilate measurements from a bioinspired, multi-modal artificial lateral line and to estimate flow properties for feedback control. The robotic prototype outfitted with a multi-modal artificial lateral line composed of an ionic polymer metal composite and of embedded pressure sensors experimentally demonstrates the distributed flow sensing and closed-loop control strategies.\nInspired by observations from a biological runner, the paper by Park and Kim presents a bioinspired quadruped controller that allows variable-speed galloping. The developed controller estimates the required vertical impulse at each stride by applying the linear momentum conservation principle in the vertical direction and prescribes the ground reaction forces at each stride. Based on a biological observation, a new control design scheme is proposed for high-speed galloping in the MIT Cheetah 2 robot. Quadrupedal animals increase the vertical impulse that is generated by ground reaction forces at each stride as running speed increases and as the duration of each stance phase is reduced, whereas the swing phase stays relatively constant. Based on a biological observation, a new control design scheme is proposed for high-speed galloping in the MIT Cheetah 2 robot. A stable 3D galloping controller is currently applied to the MIT Cheetah 2 robot and will be implemented in indoor running of the robot.\nOne of the most significant challenges in bioinspired robotics is determining how to make use of multi-modal locomotion to help robots perform a variety of tasks adaptively in different environments. In order to address the challenge properly, it is important to understand that locomotion dynamics are the result of interactions between a particular internal control structure, the mechanical dynamics and the environment. The fourth paper by Nurzaman, Kim and Lida presents an approach to enable a robot to take advantage of its multiple locomotion modes by coupling the mechanical dynamics of the robot with an internal control structure known as an attractor selection model. The robot considered is a curved-beam hopping robot that possesses rich and complex mechanical dynamics that are dependent on its interactions with the environment. Through dynamical coupling, the robot performs goal-directed locomotion by gracefully shifting between different locomotion modes regulated by sensory input, the robot's mechanical dynamics and an internally generated perturbation. The coupling between the mechanical dynamics and the attractor selection mechanism enables the robot to take advantage of the different locomotion modes to bring itself toward the goal. The approach was also implemented in a real robot, enabling it to perform goal-directed locomotion based on the same principle.\nAnimals have demonstrated the ability to move through, across and over some of the most daunting environments on earth. This versatility and adaptability stems from their capacity to alter their locomotion dynamics and employ disparate locomotion modalities to suit various terrains. Dynamic climbing is commonly employed by legged animals, allowing for rapid and robust locomotion on vertical and near-vertical substrates. The paper by Miller et al presents a biologically-inspired model for dynamic climbing that captures the underlying pendular motion observed in studies of cockroaches and geckos running on vertical surfaces. This model was inspired from observations of similar gait characteristics in the dynamics of rapidly climbing cockroaches and geckos. This paper investigated several of these factors and proposed policies and methodologies to improve performance and reliability on both dedicated climbers and multi-modal systems.\nRecent works suggest that jumping locomotion in combination with a gliding phase can be used as an effective mobility principle in robotics. The paper by Vidyasagar et al evaluated the performance of jump-gliding locomotion and provides models for the relevant dynamics of flight. It also defines a jump-gliding envelope that encompasses the range that can be achieved with jump-gliding mobility and that can then be used to evaluate the performance and improvement potential of jump-gliding robots. In order to validate the prediction of these models, a jump-gliding robot, named the 'EPFL jump-glider', has been tested in experiments to perform jumps from elevated positions, to perform steered gliding flight, to land safely from considerable heights and to move on ground by repetitive jumping.\nThe last article of the special issue by Boyer and Porez developed a set of generic tools for multibody systems dynamics devoted to the study of bioinspired locomotion in robotics. In considering a general problem of locomotion, they progressively drew a unified geometric picture of locomotion dynamics, starting from the model of discrete mobile multibody systems, followed by the case of continuous and finally soft systems. Starting from animals before moving on to robots, it is shown that there is a need to develop methodological tools for designing, modeling, control and motion planning of a new generation of robots with multi-degrees of freedom. The paper also addresses the practical problem of the efficient computation of these models by proposing a Newton-Euler-based approach to efficient locomotion dynamics, with a few illustrations of creeping, swimming and flying. The authors discovered that behind their apparent diversity, many locomotion modes share common geometric structures.\n8. Concluding remarks\nAs discussed in this article and covered by the papers in this special issue, various modes of locomotion that can be adopted by different genus groups in multiple media are investigated to understand the compromise in ability adopted by the animals when achieving multi-modal locomotion.\nConsidering all of the natural examples shown for aerial, aquatic and/or terrestrial operations, it would appear that using distinct locomotive mechanisms for multi-modal operations of this type is advantageous. This is true for both birds and insects, with birds having the advantage of higher feasible scalability of functions. More experimental works would be required to determine if the terrestrial ability has led to a decrease in aerial ability within a specific species.\nMany different types of locomotion are used across the biological classes, but it should be noted that each has a varying level of competence within the substrate, and as such, careful consideration must be given before assuming that mimicking the animal's techniques will provide the most suitable combination for real-world engineering problems [ 40 , 48 , 60 , 72 – 74 ].\nIn the near future, much closer biologist-and-robotist collaboration will still be an important step for developing multi-modal locomotion. More innovative biorobots are to be developed to emulate and investigate hybrid locomotion since man-made prototypes outperform repetitive behaviors and influential factor isolation when compared to animals. Biomechanics on transition among jumping, walking, running, rolling, crawling, swimming and/or flying should be focused on. Agile movements of animals should be further understood in principles of their central and peripheral nervous systems as well as their musculoskeletal system. Certainly, their adaptation to varying environments is also a really interesting and inspiring component. Furthermore, inspiration from emulating or understanding multi-modal locomotion should promote robotics performance and enable more practical applications. Smart materials, flexible mechanisms and advanced control strategies are essential to realize the enormous potentials in industrial, educational, common-health, security-related, home-service and special fields of robotics.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank the authors for their exciting contributions to this special issue.

The Round 2 offshore farm data has also been included in Table 5 for completeness, although the value for annual change for these farms is subject to much greater uncertainty than the other values in the table, due to the relatively small numbers of years of operating data that is currently available for the Round 2 sites.\nIt is also useful to examine the monthly average capacity factors with date rather than year of operation. This is shown in Figure 9 . The effect of newer wind farms is visible from the data with increasing monthly capacity factors for Round 1 ( Figure 9(b) ) and Round 2 ( Figure 9(c) ) farms. The large onshore farms in Figure 9(a) also show an upward trend with no marked deterioration in capacity factor and the newer farms tending to operate at increasing capacity factor levels.\nDownload in PowerPoint\nFigure 10. Offshore wind LCOE breakdown by CAPEX and OPEX, based on Arwas et al., 20 Ernst and Young, 22 Coultate, 26 Heptonstall et al., 27 GL Garrad Hassan 28 and DECC. 29 (a) Array cables; (b) Decommissioning; (c) Seabed rent; (d) Pre-development and (e) Variable O&M.\nThe CAPEX is taken to include all one-time expenditure associated with wind farm development, deployment and commissioning, such as 30 :\nthe turbine costs including the transformer, transportation to the site and installation;\nthe electrical connection infrastructure cost, including cables, sub-station, connection and power evacuation systems;\nthe civil work cost, including the foundations, road construction and buildings;\nother capital costs, including development and engineering costs, licensing procedures, consenting and permits, SCADA (Supervisory, Control and Data Acquisition) and monitoring systems, 30 etc.\nOPEX includes all ongoing expenditure, whether one-time or recurring, to operate and maintain the farm, measured on an annual basis. The most important OPEX costs of a wind energy project are 30 :\nthe costs of the running of the site, including land and sub-station rental, insurance and taxes, management and administration;\nscheduled O&M activity costs, including provisions for repair and spare parts and maintenance of the electric installation;\nallowances for unplanned maintenance to repair unforeseen failures.\nAlthough the CAPEX and OPEX component classification varies according to the reference source considered, including different levels of details, Figure 10 shows that upfront CAPEX costs recovered over the life of the wind farm account for typically 70%. Thus wind farms are capital-intensive compared to conventional fossil fuel fired technologies such as a natural gas power plant, for which principally fuel charges increase OPEX costs to typically between 40% and 70% of the LCOE. 16\nThe work by Coultate 22 shows an overall OPEX for offshore wind of around 24%, which is consistent with the other cost sources cited in Figure 10 . Heptonstall et al. 27 break the total capital cost down into the major components and separate the O&M costs into costs related to physical maintenance and costs related to non-physical services such as insurance. The contribution of the physical O&M is around 20%, representing a significant part of the total LCOE.\nMost offshore projects have a design lifetime of at least 20 years. The O&M strategy employed will influence not only the annual OPEX, but also the lifetime of the farm. A balance must be struck between high levels of maintenance to ensure longevity and lower levels to reduce running costs. To date, most O&M activities have been contracted to WT manufacturers to run in parallel with key equipment warranties, typically for the first 5 years of operation. Following the warranty period, the bigger operators might take full control of the farm assets; however, many less experienced or smaller scale operators may prefer to continue to contract for O&M to the turbine manufacturer. O&M costs are generally considered to scale with the number of turbines, as this number determines the number of personnel transfers per year and the number of replacement parts. GL Garrad Hassan examined the expected O&M costs for a 500 MW wind farm comprising 6 MW WTs, situated 55 km from shore and using an O&M strategy based around work boats with helicopter support. 28 The total OPEX was estimated to be around £430,000 per turbine per year, with an annual spend per turbine on O&M of around £290,000, averaged over a farm design life of 20 years.\nThe figures above demonstrate the importance of having a well-defined and well-managed approach to O&M activities, as a reduction in costs could dramatically affect the economic viability of large offshore wind farms and the degree to which offshore wind becomes competitive in the electricity market.\nReducing the cost of the energy produced by offshore wind projects is a major focus for the offshore wind industry 20 and for the UK Government. 25 Finding ways to reduce the cost of O&M services and optimising asset performance have crucial roles in reducing the LCOE from offshore wind moving forward.\nIt is worth noting that the costs of operation are considerably lower than the costs of maintenance. Operating costs include costs associated with high-level asset management, including remote system monitoring, environmental monitoring, electricity sales, marketing and administration.\nMaintenance optimisation\nMaintenance actions account for the majority of O&M costs incurred in large wind farms, the purpose being to achieve a desired level of performance from a component or system.\nCorrective maintenance is the current O&M strategy used for existing onshore and offshore wind farms. 31 , 32 In case of a failure, a maintenance action is launched at the first opportunity to carry out the repair, resulting in an additional visit to the WT over any planned maintenance visits. Corrective maintenance practice is successfully employed onshore, with minimal interference from environmental conditions, but it is largely impractical offshore. Faults require a range of different responses from a simple inspection and restart of a WT, which might take a couple of hours, through to the replacement of an offshore sub-station transformer, which could take weeks or even months to implement. Difficult-to-access locations and the high cost of the specialist personnel and access equipment needed, means that offshore O&M costs have been quantified as three to five times greater than those for onshore. 33 , 34 The cost difference could potentially increase even further for next generation wind farm developments, which will be situated further offshore in higher average wind speeds and with more challenging sea conditions. Unscheduled maintenance at day-rate costs of up to €1000 per operative 35 has been shown to account for approximately 70% of the O&M costs. 36 These high figures emphasise the need for optimising the O&M strategy for unmanned offshore wind farms to reduce unexpected turbine downtime, avoid lost revenue and improve the availability, so that competitive prices for the produced electricity can be achieved. 37\nA Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) preventive practice can contribute significantly to minimising the offshore O&M costs, by lowering the number of inspection visits and corrective maintenance actions needed. 38 – 42 This maintenance approach involves repair or replacement of components based on their state of health and on the operating history of the particular machine in question. Advanced and reliable monitoring and analysis techniques are needed to plan CBM using data from the SCADA systems and Condition Monitoring Systems (CMS) that are already fitted to WTs.\nReliability\nWT reliability plays a key role in the economic success of a wind farm projects. Poor reliability directly affects the project's revenue stream through both increased O&M costs and reduced availability to generate power due to turbine downtime.\nDetailed measurements of offshore WT failure rates are not available in the public domain in statistically significant numbers. For this reason the available literature on reliability focuses principally on publicly available onshore data. However, operators and manufacturers are usually extremely reluctant to disclose data about reliability because the WT industry is extremely competitive and failure data concerning a manufacturer's technology has strong commercial relevance for both the procurement and operation of assets. As a result, the sources of this type of information are restricted to a few publicly available databases. 43 – 49 An increasingly strong argument exists for the WT industry to find ways of ending this restrictive practice, in favour of the collective benefit that will arise from sharing of data on improving the overall economic performance of WT assets compared to other available generating technologies. At present, the available reliability studies use data from different WT populations, types and sizes; however, the failure statistics show a considerable agreement.\nFigure 11 summarises the analysis of reliability data taken from three of the most comprehensive failure statistics datasets for onshore WTs that are currently available. These are data from the German Wissenschaftliches Mess-und Evaluierungsprogramm (WMEP), 46 the German Landwirtschaftskammer (LWK) 47 and the Ekofisk Swedish 45 surveys. Failure and downtime data have been categorised by WT sub-assembly. The analysis of the datasets reveals common trends and provide valuable insights into the reliability of the various onshore WT drive train components.\nDownload in PowerPoint\nFigure 11. Failure rate and downtime data for onshore WTs from three large public domain reliability surveys. 45 , 50\nFigure 11 highlights that for onshore wind assets the highest failure rate sub-assemblies do not necessarily cause the most downtime. Whilst electrical sub-assemblies appear to have higher failure rates and shorter downtimes, mechanical sub-assemblies, including blades, gearbox and generator components, tend to have relatively low failure rates but very long downtimes. Similar results have been obtained by Pinar Perez et al. 51 where data were compared from a selection of major reliability studies from the literature, giving confidence in the validity of the information shown in Figure 11 .\nThe WMEP, LWK and Swedish datasets have some important limitations. The data was collected during 1993–2006 46 , 47 and 1997–2005 45 and the majority of the turbines surveyed are much lower power than current-day turbines and use some technologies that have now been superseded. The more recent ReliaWind study 49 addressed these limitations by considering only turbines that met the following requirements: power rating greater or equal to 850 kW, variable speed, pitch regulated, operating for a minimum of 2 years and from a wind farm that consists of at least 15 turbines. Figures 12 and 13 show the results of the ReliaWind study, which broke the turbine into a detailed taxonomy of sub-systems and sub-assemblies to identify critical areas of interest from >4000 onshore wind turbine years of data. It should be noted that, unlike the data shown in Figure 11 , for reasons of confidentiality the published ReliaWind results do not show the actual failure rate and downtime, only the percentage distribution. In spite of the diverse technologies and power ratings, the ReliaWind findings are broadly comparable with the WMEP, LWK and the Swedish surveys and the same failure rate trend emerges. However, the downtime trend shows much greater emphasis on the rotor and power modules, because it is believed these newer variable speed WTs have not yet experienced major gearbox, generator or blade failures to date in service. 52\nDownload in PowerPoint\nFigure 13. Distribution of normalised downtime by sub-system and sub-assembly for WTs of multiple manufacturers from the ReliaWind survey. 49\nFaulstich et al. 53 showed that 75% of onshore WT failures are responsible for only about 5% of the downtime, whereas the remaining 25% of failures cause 95% of downtime. Downtime onshore is dominated by a small number of large fault types, mainly associated with gearboxes, generators and blades. These require complex and costly repair procedures. The 75% of faults causing 5% of the downtime are mostly associated with electrical faults, which, in the majority of cases, are relatively quick and easy to corrected via remote or local resets. It is worth noting that as WTs move offshore, limited accessibility, longer delays for favourable weather windows, travel and maintenance execution times will all be adversely impacted. Local resets will be associated with high costs due to difficult of accessing the turbines, which will be likely to significantly increase the downtime contribution from these sub-assemblies. According to McMillan and Ault, 33 compared to onshore, the offshore downtime increase is due to two main factors: the lead time for a suitable jack-up crane vessel, cranes and other associated equipment (needed for generator, gearbox and blade), assumed to be 10 days, and the logistics time from the upload point to the wind farm, considered to be one day. For the major WT component outages, typical offshore downtime values have then been quantified as 41 days for the gearbox, 32 days for the generator, 41 days for the blade and 2 days for the electronic sub-systems replacements. The authors also emphasised that excessive wind speed conditions may further delay the maintenance actions, over and above these levels.\nCrabtree 54 carried out a reliability analysis of 3 years of available data from the Egmond aan Zee offshore wind farm in the Netherlands. This wind farm features 36 Vestas V90-3MW WTs that are situated 10–18 km offshore and in 17–23 m water depth in the North Sea. Operational reports gave the number of stops resulting from 13 sub-assemblies. The results are summarised in Figure 14 .\nDownload in PowerPoint\nFigure 14. Stop rate and downtime data from Egmond aan Zee wind farm over 3 years. 54\nA direct comparison between the onshore data in Figure 11 and offshore data in Figure 14 cannot be made as stops and failures are different concepts. However, it can be seen that the overall distribution is similar, with the sub-assemblies that suffer from the higher stop and failure rates not necessarily resulting in the longest periods of downtime. Analysis of the data shown in Figure 14 reveals that the control system dominates and causes 36% of the stops in the offshore environment, but it results in only 9.5% of the total downtime. Conversely, the gearbox and generator respectively contribute only 6.7% and 2.8% to the total stops, but account for 55% and 15% respectively of the downtime.\nThe adoption of appropriate design and operational strategies, choice of the most effective turbine architectures, installation of effective CMSs and the adoption of optimised O&M strategies, are all essential elements of the development work needed to reduce the cost of energy from offshore wind farms to competitive levels. Emphasis should be placed on avoiding large (expected as well as unexpected) maintenance events that require the deployment of expensive and specialized equipment. Improving the intrinsic reliability of WT assets will make a major contribution towards achieving the cost reduction targets. This will be only possible through the development of standard methodologies for reliability data collection and analysis, and through close collaboration between manufacturers, operators and research organisations.\nCondition monitoring\nThe need to successfully detect incipient faults before catastrophic failures occur in order to increase WT availability and reduce the cost of energy, has resulted in the development of a large number of CMSs by a range of suppliers. Modern WTs are equipped with SCADA-based and CMS-based systems for the online active remote monitoring and control of their components. This information can be used to predict, detect and diagnose faults as they emerge.\nThe online monitoring and fault detection are relatively new concepts in the wind industry. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop efficient and cost-effective condition monitoring techniques and signal processing methods for WTs. Several reviews have been published in the literature, including, 42 , 55 – 62 discussing the main condition monitoring techniques, the signal processing methods proposed for fault detection and diagnosis and their applications in wind power. The studies also provide a comprehensive explanation of the new emerging techniques currently being researched. Condition monitoring technologies from other applications that can be adapted for use in WTs have been identified as vibration analysis, oil analysis, temperature measurements, strain measurements, thermography, acoustic emissions, and electrical signals. Amongst these, vibration, temperature and oil monitoring techniques are currently the most widely used in WT applications, due to their established successes in other applications.\nSome of the more recently emerging condition monitoring techniques described in the research literature 42 , 62 include ultrasonic testing which is potentially value adding for detecting early blade or tower defects, shaft torque and torsional vibration measurements for main shaft and gearbox condition monitoring, and shock pulse methods as an online approach to detecting bearing faults. To date, little work has been done in the area of prognosis models. Much of the research in this area is generic and being conducted by the aerospace community for civil and military aviation. Some specific research will be required to apply the principles of prognosis to the wind power industry. 55\nThe goal of this section is to give an overview of the current state of the art, the main benefits, current challenges and limitations of commercial available WT SCADA-based and CMS-based systems.\nSCADA systems record low frequency (typically 10-min interval) data logging of the signals from a range of instrumentation (anemometers, thermocouples, vibration transducers, oil debris detectors, etc.), which the system uses to monitor the health and supervise the operation of the WT. It is a valuable low-cost monitoring system, integrating cheap, high-volume instrumentation, information and communication technology. Chen et al. 63 surveyed the SCADA systems currently available in the wind industry. The survey contains information gathered over several years (from 2011 to 2014) through interaction with SCADA monitoring system and turbine manufacturers and includes information obtained from various product brochures, technical documents and personal interaction with sales and technical personnel. It shows that most of the commercially available SCADA systems are able to analyse real-time data with WT performance analysis techniques varying from tailored statistical methods to the use of artificial intelligence. One of the principal benefits of SCADA systems is that they provide an operating history of individual WTs and entire wind farms. The data recorded includes, alarms, detailed fault logs and environmental and operating conditions leading up to fault occurrences. SCADA systems are not effective in detecting incipient turbine faults and providing operators with sufficient warning for preventative action to be undertaken. The main challenges are the considerable amount of analysis that is required for the online interpretation of the large volume of data generated, and the low data rate which does not permit the in-depth analysis that is generally needed for accurate diagnosis using existing condition monitoring methodologies. Potentially, SCADA alarms can help a turbine operator to understand the health of a WT and its key components, but for large wind farms these alarms are too frequent for any meaningful online analysis to be undertaken using existing techniques.\nAs more and larger wind farms are being developed, the amount data collected by SCADA systems is also increasing exponentially and is becoming difficult to manage with conventional data processing methods. Therefore, the development of advanced data fusion/mining techniques and reliable physics of failure based theoretical modelling is required, in order to improve the ability of SCADA systems to detect the onset of WT failures early and accurately. Making better use of SCADA data is currently an active area of research. Several workers have recently suggested and demonstrated new approaches for rigorous analysis of the information collected by SCADA systems, to provide long-term fault detection, diagnosis and prognosis for the main WT sub-assemblies. These include the gearbox, the converter and the pitch control system. Examples are early fault identification techniques based on artificial neural network, 64 calculation of damage accumulation and risk of failure using physics of failure approach 65 and fault prognosis procedure using a priori knowledge-based adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. 66 New signal algorithms have been developed to analyse SCADA alarms and to detect WT component faults for the pitch and converter systems 67 and for the gearboxes, 68 , 69 although these techniques still require some further testing and tuning. In order to overcome the difficulties associated with the handling of extremely large and complex SCADA datasets using traditional relational databases, Viharos et al. 70 proposed a Business Intelligence reporting prototype system for wind farm analytics which exploits the advantages of the emerging ‘Big Data’ tools. The paper shows how detailed operation data from a large number of wind farms can be collected and stored for future use. Validation and implementation of this type of techniques will provide operators with sufficient time to make more informed decisions concerning maintenance interventions on their machines.\nIn the late 1990s, the installation of WT CMSs started to be requested by some insurance companies in Europe, 71 following a large number of claims resulting from catastrophic gearbox failures. The drive train is one of the highest cost and most trouble prone WT sub-systems. German insurers introduced this requirement as a cost deterrent, in order to encourage an improvement in its operating life.\nToday, a number of certified CMSs are available to the wind industry. The survey of commercially available WT CMSs conducted by Durham University and the UK SUPERGEN Wind Energy Technologies Consortium, 72 provides an up to date review of the current state of the art of available systems. The document contains information gathered over several years (between 2008 and 2014) through interaction with monitoring system and turbine manufacturers and includes information obtained from various product brochures, technical documents and personal interaction with sales and technical personnel. According to the survey, the majority of CMSs are based on high-frequency vibration monitoring of the drive train, with special focus on main bearing, gears and bearings, although some are used in combination with oil particle counters and fibre-optic strain gauges to enhance their monitoring capabilities. No commercial CMS is offered for the electrical and power electronic components and the yaw and pitch systems, beyond what is monitored by the SCADA system. This is a gap that needs to be addressed as the reliability of WT electrical systems is being increasingly recognised as a growing concern, 49 as the mechanical systems become more reliable. This is particularly the case for offshore installations, where deterioration in electrical components may be accelerated in the harsh environment due to enhanced rates of corrosion and erosion.\nPractical experience with CMSs in wind farms to date shows that it is problematic to achieve reliable and cost effective applications. 33 The use of condition monitoring techniques has been an integral part of asset management in other industries for decades. In recent years, the technology has been increasingly adopted by the wind sector. Generic techniques are well understood, but it is their adaptation for application on unmanned and remote WT power plants that is proving challenging. 73 There is still insufficient recognition amongst WT maintenance staff of the benefits that CMSs are able to provide. 62 The principal differences that distinguish WT operation from operation of other types of equipment are variable operating speed and the stochastic characteristics of the aerodynamic loads on the structure. 61 The non-stationary signals make it difficult to apply traditional frequency domain signal processing techniques in the development of effective algorithms for early fault detection and diagnosis. 59 , 62 The majority of commercially available WT CMSs rely on the experience of operators to successfully detect faults, by noting changes in spectra at different specific speeds and loads. 74\nThe complexity and volume of information produced by CMSs also presents a challenge for operators for daily maintenance purposes. It is now common place for modern large onshore and offshore WTs (>1.5 MW) to be equipped with some form of CMS. 62 However, frequent false alarms and the costly specialist knowledge required for manual interpretation of the complex monitoring signals have discouraged WT operators from widespread adoption of these systems. Moreover, with the growth in numbers of WTs installed, especially offshore, the manual examination and comparison of the condition monitoring data will become increasingly impractical, unless simplified monitoring techniques can be developed and implemented. These will also potentially benefit from incorporating advanced data fusion and mining techniques, already successfully used in various sectors, such as manufacturing, 75 management 76 and health care. 77\nThe principal aspects of condition monitoring technology that need to be improved to encourage increased engagement by wind farm operators are the accuracy and reliability of diagnostic decisions, including level of severity evaluation, and the development of reliable and accurate prognostic tools. In order to work effectively in the challenging offshore environment, it is evident that an increased degree of automation to deliver actionable maintenance recommendations is mandatory for cost effective and fit-for-purpose CMSs. The challenge is to achieve earlier detection, diagnosis and prognosis of faults with the necessary levels of accuracy and automation needed to reduce manpower and access costs on large-scale offshore wind farm developments. Recent experimental research, such as Wiggelinkhuizen et al., 58 Hameed et al., 60 Crabtree, 74 Djurović et al., 78 Zappalá et al., 79 Zaggout et al. 80 and Vilchis-Rodriguez et al., 81 has been focused on the development of advanced new techniques for incorporation into existing WT CMSs, to move towards this goal. The work by Zhang et al. 82 is an example of a data mining approach to establish models for predicting vibration excitement which has been validated by data from a damaged gearbox tested by the US Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).\nFinally, the majority of CMSs currently operate independently from the SCADA systems and therefore at present these CMS systems do not have direct and immediate access to the valuable information on operational parameters monitored and stored on the SCADA system. It is expected that ultimately, integrated autonomous CMSs and SCADA systems incorporated into WT controllers will be developed, for optimised cost and condition monitoring effectiveness. 52\nConclusions\nSection:\nAn analysis of large UK offshore and onshore wind farm capacity factor data has been reported in this paper. The United Kingdom is the global leader in installed offshore wind farm capacity. The data used in the study covers more than 7000 turbine years of operation. It shows that:\nOffshore annual and monthly capacity factors for the whole UK portfolio are higher than onshore capacity factors. This is thought to be due to the favourable characteristics of offshore wind resource.\nThe second generation UK Round 2 wind farms have benefitted from operating experience gained at the earlier Round 1 sites, allowing higher capacity factors to be achieved at the more recently installed farms.\nOverall, UK offshore farms have achieved an average monthly capacity factor of 34.5% compared to 25.6% onshore, during full operation. In isolation, Round 2 farms achieved a higher average monthly capacity factor of 38.3%.\nPeak monthly offshore capacity factors have risen to as high as 75.8% for Round 2 farms compared to 64.1% for UK large onshore farms.\nThis paper shows that onshore wind farms see a decrease (by year of operation) in average annual capacity factor of 0.75% per year; however, there is clear indication that a part of this decrease is the result of the changing portfolio of wind farms. The newer farms generally demonstrate a higher capacity factor and this skews the earlier data.\nA breakdown of the cost of energy generation from wind farms has highlighted the importance of reducing O&M costs from current levels. The challenges that must be overcome and the research that is currently underway to help to achieve this have been reviewed. Improved data handling and analysis techniques, integration of condition monitoring and SCADA systems and improved cost/benefit analysis from adopting condition based maintenance strategies are all identified as being important steps towards achieving this goal and have been discussed in the paper. Finally, the need for more open sharing of operating data across the wind industry and research community to accelerate the development process has been highlighted.\nFunding\nThe authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nThis work was funded in part by the UK EPSRC SUPERGEN Wind Hub, EP/L014106/1, and the SUPERGEN Wind Energy Technologies programme, EP/H018662/1.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\n""","0.067772724","""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0957650915597560""","[-1.571858,54.768139]"

A key benefit of formation flying is the ability to reconfigure the spacecraft formation to achieve different mission objectives. In this paper, generation of fuel optimal manoeuvres for spacecraft formation reconfiguration is modelled and analysed as a multi-agent optimal control problem. Multi-agent optimal control is quite different from the traditional optimal control for single agent. Specifically, in addition to fuel optimization for a single agent, multi-agent optimal control necessitates consideration of task assignment among agents for terminal targets in the optimization process. In this paper, we develop an efficient hybrid optimization algorithm to address such a problem. The proposed multi-agent optimal control methodology uses calculus of variation, task assignment, and parameter optimization at different stages of the optimization process. This optimization algorithm employs a distributed computational architecture. In addition, the task assignment algorithm, which guarantees the global optimal assignment of agents, is constructed using the celebrated principle of optimality from dynamic programming. A communication protocol is developed to facilitate decentralized decision making among agents. Simulation results are included to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed multi-agent optimal control algorithm for fuel optimal spacecraft formation reconfiguration.

Wearable fitness devices can provide opportunities for physical activity promotion. Purpose: The aim of the study was to explore whether wearable healthy lifestyle technologies impacted on adolescents’ (13- to 14-year-olds) motivation for physical activity. Methods: The study was a mixed method sequential design. Participants were 84 adolescents (44 girls, 40 boys) from 6 physical education classes. Pupils were issued with a Fitbit to wear for 8 weeks and completed pre-/posttest questionnaires that assessed motivational regulation and psychological need satisfaction. Adolescents also engaged in focus group interviews after wearing the Fitbit for 8 weeks. Quantitative data were analyzed using a repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to explore differences between gender and time. Qualitative data analysis was conducted deductively using self-determination theory. Results: The quantitative findings identified significant reductions in need satisfaction and autonomous motivation and significant increases in amotivation after 8 weeks. Qualitative evidence suggested short-term increases in motivation through feelings of competition, guilt, and internal pressure. Discussion: Findings suggest that healthy lifestyle technology may have negative motivational consequences. Translation to Health Education Practice: Certified Health Education Specialists should support young people to personalize health targets in order to critically engage with normalized health targets.\nBackground\nStudies show that considerable proportions of young people do not meet the national guidelines for daily physical activity. 1 Dudley D, Goodyear VA, Baxter D.

Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics; 2007:1–19.  [Google Scholar] The theory proposes that in order for individuals to be optimally motivated, behaviors should be self-determined; in other words, volitional. Individuals display more self-determined forms of motivation as they internalize to a greater degree the reasons for engaging in the behavior, thus engaging in a behavior out of interest or for their own sake as opposed to the outcomes of the activity. In contrast, behaviors are less self-determined when an activity is undertaken as a means to an end that lies outside participation in the activity itself. More self-determined forms of motivation are associated with physical activity adoption and adherence. 33 Teixeira PJ, Carraca EV, Markland D, et al.

Thus, autonomous motivation is based on the values or personal interests of the individual. In contrast, controlled motivation is less self-determined and based on demands that are externally or internally posed. 29 Van den Berghe L, Vansteenkiste M, Cardon G, et al.

[Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar]\nHealthy lifestyle technology and self-determination theory\nThe healthy lifestyle technology explored in this article is the Fitbit device; specifically, the Fitbit Charge physical activity wristband and the associated app. The wristband has a visual display that assesses steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned, floors climbed, and distance traveled. Data can be synchronized with the Fitbit app that can be downloaded onto a mobile device. The Fitbit app allows users to monitor physical activity progress, tailor physical activity goals, record workouts, share and compete with friends, earn badges, and log food and track sleep patterns. In reference to self-determination theory, these functions demonstrate clear potential for positive impact on competence, autonomy, and relatedness.\nCompetence could be positively satisfied by the Fitbit providing feedback on physical activity performance through badges, alerts, and prompts. For example, when an individual achieves 10 000 daily steps—a predetermined physical activity level of the Fitbit—his or her Fitbit will vibrate and flash to signify that this physical activity goal has been achieved. Further, the individual can gain certain badges—which are displayed on the app—for meeting different types of physical activity targets, such as walking the accumulated distance of the Serengeti. In relation to self-determination theory, positive feedback on physical activity behaviors can increase perceptions of competence and positively impact self-determined motivation. 46 Koka A, Hein V.

J Teach Phys Educ. 2006;25:36–57. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar]\nAutonomy can be satisfied by the Fitbit device and app by the potential to personalize physical activity targets. Individuals may alter the predetermined daily step goal, distance traveled, and active minutes to suit their individual physical activity needs. In addition, the Fitbit device and app do not prescribe the activities through which these goals should be achieved. Research consistently suggests that autonomy-supportive environments, in which young people have a sense of choice over their physical activity behaviors, lead to higher levels of physical activity. 51 Roemmich JN, Lambiase MJ, McCarthy TF, et al. Autonomy supportive environments and mastery as basic factors to motivate physical activity in children: a controlled laboratory study. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act. 2012;9. doi:10.1186/1479-5868-9-16. [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar]\nRelatedness could be satisfied through the social features on the app. For example, the app allows individuals to form Fitbit friends (which may be within or outside of peer groups), communicate with these friends (via emojis or text), and challenge their friends to physical activity competitions. Evidence suggests that relatedness can be satisfied through both face-to-face interactions and online communications, 52 Downie M, Mageau GA, Koestner R. What makes for pleasant social interaction?

[Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] demonstrating potential for this Fitbit app to address this motivational construct. This is a powerful feature, given that when young people perceive a high sense of relatedness, they are more likely to exhibit higher engagement in physical activity behaviors. 53 Zhang T, Solomon MA, Kosma M, et al.

New research that provides evidence-based insights on the motivational impact of healthy lifestyle technologies will provide urgently needed understandings on the role of technology in health and physical activity promotion in young people. The purpose of this article is to explore whether wearable healthy lifestyle technologies influence adolescents’ motivation for physical activity. Data are presented from an exploratory mixed methods sequential research design. The primary objective of the study is to examine whether adolescents’ (age 13–14) motivation for physical activity and basic psychological need satisfaction change over an 8-week period while they wore a Fitbit device and used the associated Fitbit app. Using self-determination theory as a guiding theoretical framework it was hypothesized that after wearing the Fitbit participants would experience greater need satisfaction, greater self-determined forms of motivation, and less amotivation.\nMethods\nThe study was a mixed methods sequential intervention design. The study applied pre-/posttest quantitative questionnaires, followed by qualitative focus group interviews at the end of the 8-week period. Through this design, the methods sought to measure impact on motivation and capture details of context, alongside user perceptions. Given that most empirical insights into healthy lifestyle technologies lack qualitative insights into how users engage and use apps and devices, 21 Dute DJ, Bemelmans WJE, Breda J. Using mobile apps to promote a healthy lifestyle among adolescents and students: a review of the theoretical basis and lessons learned. JMIR mHealth uHealth. 2016;4(2):e39. doi:10.2196/mhealth.3559. [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] this research design serves to provide nuanced and broader understandings on the role of healthy lifestyle technologies in physical activity promotion in young people, by considering both objective and subjective insights. Prior to data collection, university ethical approval was granted and informed consent or assent was obtained from participants. A detailed account of the ethical procedures followed can be accessed in previous publications. 55 Goodyear VA Social media, apps and wearable technologies: navigating ethical dilemmas and procedures. Qual Res Sport Exerc Health. 2017;9:285–302. [Taylor & Francis Online]   [Google Scholar] Fitbit’s terms and conditions were also consulted and followed during this study.\nParticipants\nOne hundred 13- to 14-year-olds (53 females, 47 males) were invited to participate in the study. Participants were recruited from 6 randomly selected physical education classes within 2 schools. Class sizes ranged from 10 to 16, with an average class size of 14. The schools were selected based on a convenience approach. One school was based in the southeast United Kingdom and the other school was based in the northwest United Kingdom. The 2 schools differed in their socioeconomic demographics; school 1 was a nonselective private school and school 2 was a comprehensive state school. Parental consent and pupil assent were obtained for all participants.\nIntervention\nParticipants were provided with a Fitbit Charge to wear for 8 weeks. An 8-week duration was selected because this period allows for the identification of behavior change in step-based programs. 56 Lubans DR, Morgan PJ. Evaluation of an extra-curricular school sport program promoting lifestyle and lifetime activity. J Sport Sci. 2008;26:519–529. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] The Fitbit Charge was used as the object of the intervention. Fitbit profiles were provided to participants using personalized e-mail addresses and passwords. Instructions were provided on the functional capabilities and operational features of the device and the app. Participants were instructed to wear the Fitbit for the 8-week period.\nData generation\nMotivational regulation\nPrior to being issued with the Fitbit device (pre) and at week 8 (post), pupils completed the Behavioural Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire II. 57 Markland D, Tobin V. A modification to the behavioural regulation in exercise questionnaire to include an assessment of amotivation. J Sports Exerc Psychol. 2004;26:191–196. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] The questionnaire was adapted to replace the term exercise with physical activity in order to assess motivation toward physical activity. The Behavioural Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire II consists of 19 items that represent 5 different subscales that include amotivation (eg, I don’t see why I should have to do physical activity), external regulation (eg, I feel under pressure from my friends/family to do physical activity), introjected regulation (eg, I feel guilty when I don’t do physical activity), identified regulation (eg, I value the benefits of physical activity), and intrinsic regulation (eg, I do physical activity because it’s fun). Participants were asked to respond to each item on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not true for me) to 4 (very true for me). For data analysis, mean scores for autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and amotivation were calculated. Scores for autonomous motivation were calculated by calculating the mean scores of intrinsic and identified items. Scores for controlled motivation were calculated using the mean scores of introjected and external regulation items.\nNeed satisfaction\nPupils also completed the Psychological Need Satisfaction in Exercise scale, modified to the physical activity context 58 Gunnell KE, Wilson PM, Zumbo BDM, et al. Psychological need satisfaction in exercise scale: an investigation of measurement invariance. Meas Phys Educ Exerc Sci. 2012;16:219–236. [Taylor & Francis Online]   [Google Scholar] pre- and postintervention. This measure consists of a 16-item scale that assesses the basic psychological needs of competence (eg, I feel I am able to complete physical activities that are personally challenging), autonomy (eg, I feel free to do physical activity in my own way), and relatedness (eg, I feel attached to my physical activity companions because they accept me for who I am) in a physical activity context. Participants were asked to respond to statements on a 6-item scale of 1 (false) to 6 (true).\nContext and user perceptions\nTo generate contextual understandings on how pupils used the Fitbit device and app and their perceptions on the role of this technology in physical activity promotion, data were generated from 9 focus group interviews (4–6 members) in week 8 (post). Groups for interviews were selected by the class teacher to be representative of different pupil interests and variations in physical activity abilities across the respective classes. Interviews were conducted by the researchers using an adapted version of the nominal group technique 59 Macphail A. Nominal group technique: a useful method for working with young people. Br Educ Res J. 2001;27(2):161–170. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] in a semistructured format. Each pupil was asked to respond to 10 statements that related to their experiences of using the Fitbit. For example, “I would recommend using the Fitbit to other people my age because …” and “I would not recommend using a Fitbit to people my age because. …” Following the individual responses to each statement, the groups were then prompted to share their thoughts and perceptions on the responses until they reached a level of agreement. This process was repeated for all 10 statements.\nData analysis\nData from the need satisfaction and motivational regulation questionnaires were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 22 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). Descriptive statistics were calculated for all dependent variables using mean and standard deviations. In order to assess the motivational differences pre and post Fitbit and the differences between sex and interactions between sex and time, a repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted. Gender was included in the MANOVA model due to the differences in physical activity levels of boys and girls. 49 Ntoumanis N. A prospective study of participation in optimal school physical education based on self-determination theory. J Educ Psychol. 2005;75:411–433. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] The MANOVA was used to explore the 2 independent variables of sex and time and the multiple dependent variables (autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, amotivation, competence, autonomy, and relatedness). Statistical significance was determined by P < .05. Cronbach’s alpha levels for all subscales at pre- and posttest exceeded .70, meeting acceptable criteria ( Table 1 ).\nThe Motivational Impact of Wearable Healthy Lifestyle Technologies: A Self-determination Perspective on Fitbits With Adolescents\nAll authors\nCSV Display Table\nConcepts from the framework of self-determination theory were used to analyze the focus group data. The process was therefore deductive and encompassed 2 aims: (1) identifying how the constructs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness existed in the qualitative data and (2) locating the form of self-determination that was experienced by the participants; that is, lower to higher levels of self-determination. These 2 aims ensured that the authors remained focused on the overarching objective of the article: to examine whether adolescents’ (age 13–14) motivation for physical activity and basic psychological need satisfaction change over an 8-week period during which they wore a Fitbit device and used the associated Fitbit app.\nThe first step involved both authors reading the interview transcripts to identify important segments that related to competence, autonomy, and relatedness and lower or high levels of self-determination. In the second step, the authors identified appropriate analytical questions related to the self-determination framework to analyze the segments of data:\nHow does the Fitbit and app support or hinder competence?\nHow does the Fitbit and app support or hinder autonomy?\nHow does the Fitbit and app support or hinder relatedness?\nWhat types of self-determined forms of motivation do the Fitbit and app support or hinder?\nAfter the questions were identified, the authors coded the data related to these questions. In keeping with the deductive approach, the data sets were reorganized into separate documents in relation to the different analytical questions. Data not related to the analytical questions but deemed important by the authors were placed in an additional document. The third step involved a peer examination strategy where the authors discussed and shared their independent analyses and their answers to the analytical questions from the data. In this process, the data were moved into different categories and subcategories and the authors described their justifications to each other on the placement of data. No strong disagreements between the authors occurred during this process.\nThough a level of author bias is acknowledged as a limitation of the analytical process, the qualitative analysis revealed themes related to (1) competence, (2) relatedness, (3) controlled motivation, and (4) short-term motivation. The qualitative data did not reveal detailed insights into the concept of autonomy. Short-term motivation was not a key focus of the analytical questions but was identified by both authors as important in relation to the overarching objective of the article. The importance of presenting short-term motivation as a theme was further cross-referenced with the quantitative data. The authors agreed that this theme should be included due to the added value of offering an explanation to the quantitative data. Other important segments of the data were identified, such as calories and definitions of health as fitness. These data, however, did not relate to the objective of the article and/or the constructs of motivation and was disregarded.\nA relativist approach was used to guide the validity of this mixed methods design and the analytical processes. 60 Burke S.

In this study, the list included the following criteria: the worthiness of the topic, which was determined through reviewing contemporary literature in qualitative and quantitative research designs; the significant contribution of the work, which was understood through identified gaps in the evidence base on the effects of healthy lifestyle technologies on young people (age 13–14); and the comprehensiveness of the evidence that was achieved through qualitative and quantitative sources of data and data generation and analysis guided by an established theoretical framework; credibility, which was determined through the process of peer examination and opened up a dialogue between the authors about the fairness, appropriateness, and believability of the data and the use of previously validated questionnaires and procedures; and transparency, that occurred through ongoing dialogue between the authors. This study also aimed for coherence. In other words, how the study coheres in terms of purpose, methods, and results. 60 Burke S. Rethinking “validity” and “trustworthiness” in qualitative inquiry.

Pupils commented that the standardized target of 10 000 steps was unfair, especially if you lacked the ability to achieve those targets: “You can feel under pressure to do a certain amount of steps or to be better than what you’re maybe capable of” (school 2, focus group interview 3). The pupils also reported that though they strived to achieve this externally prescribed target, they were often unable to achieve this goal: “I did less than you’re meant to, but more than I thought I would” (school 2, focus group interview 3). The pressure of not obtaining the steps also negatively impacted how the participants viewed themselves: “Then you sit there and you realise it’s seven o’clock and you’ve got, like, ten steps, you feel really bad” (school 1, focus group interview 2). The pupils’ uses of the Fitbit and the Fitbit app, therefore, had a negative influence on their perceptions of competence due to predetermined targets that were not relevant to their individual needs.\nRelatedness\nCompetition with peers emerged as a key component function of the app that promoted social relationships. Pupils reported that they set up competitions in their peer groups and that these competitions encouraged them to engage in more physical activity: “I learnt that I was encouraged to do a lot more sports when I was wearing the Fitbit and I wanted to try and beat my friend’s record” (school 1, focus group interview 1). The pupils also commented on how the Fitbit was a social device that promoted a sense of connection with peers who also had a Fitbit and who engaged with physical activity: “I normally went to one of my friends’ houses because he had a Fitbit already and I was like, ‘Oh, how many steps have you done in a day?’ and how to get more steps and, ‘What do you do?’ and that” (school 1, focus group interview 1). In this sense, the Fitbit allowed the pupils to engage with discussions about physical activity and develop common understandings and behaviours. However, the pupils also acknowledged that competition did not always have positive implications: “It became a competition between people, which is sometimes good but sometimes bad” (school 2, focus group interview 4). The competitive element resulted in peer pressure to achieve goals: “Some people maybe feel peer pressure to do fitness, to keep their steps and stuff up” (school 2, focus group interview 2) and, in some cases, induced a sense of guilt: “You can sometimes feel guilty. Like when I first got this Fitbit, if I hadn’t done 10 000 steps before I went to bed, I used to just walk up and down the corridor because I couldn’t let someone else beat me” (school 2, focus group interview 4). Competition was therefore a central feature of the Fitbit device and app that pupils attended to. For some, the competitive element encouraged more physical activity, whereas for others, striving to beat their peers resulted in negative feelings of self.\nControlled motivation\nThe competition element was an external pressure to engage in physical activity. Pupils reported on how the competition encouraged them to be more active: “It makes you do a lot more walking because you want to try and beat your friends on it as well” (school 1, focus group interview 3). However, none of the pupils reported engaging in physical activity for fun during the 8-week period and strongly communicated that they were driven to engage in physical activity through competition: “If we had a competition, you’re gaining exercise, doing more exercise to beat the other person” (school 2, focus group interview 5). It also emerged that the externally prescribed physical activity target of 10 000 steps was acting as a source of controlled motivation: “When you look at your steps, sometimes you think it’s not high enough, so you do that or something, just to try and get your steps up. That’s what quite a lot of people did” (school 2, focus group interview 1). The pupils commented on the external pressure of achieving the prescribed 10 000 steps: “It’s good for features for walking and finding out what you do, but no as in it sets limits. It says you should do this and it pressurises you” (school 2, focus group interview 3). This evidence suggests that pupils were motivated to engage in physical activity through feelings that were not self-determined and that competition may act as a form of introjected regulation in which pupils engaged in physical activity through feelings of pressure or guilt.\nShort-term motivation\nThe novelty effect was a key component to the Fitbit raised by pupils. It was consistently reported that after about 4 weeks pupils became bored with the Fitbit: “I used it for the first 4 weeks, then just gave up” (school 1, focus group interview 2) and “After about, like, 4 to 5 weeks, some weekends I’d just leave it on the table, like all day” (school 1, focus group interview 1). Though this novelty period made some pupils more physically active, following the first 4 weeks their reported physical activity levels declined; “It did for the first 4 weeks, and then the last couple of weeks I just sat at home all day” (school 1, focus group interview 2). Some pupils discussed how after the initial novelty period they were discouraged from engaging in physical activity “I feel like, in the first few weeks, I was motivated more, but then by the end I was just sort of discouraged by—It’s not like I didn’t do exercises, just—I don’t know” (school 2, focus group interview 5). Overall, there was a strong sense that after this novelty period, pupils were less motivated to engage in physical activity: “It’s like you’ve got something new and use it for ages and then just, like, it doesn’t bother you anymore” (school 2, focus group interview 5). This evidence suggests that though the Fitbit serves to promote physical activity, for the pupils in this study, the Fitbit may have only produced modest and short-term effects.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this study was to examine whether healthy lifestyle technologies impact young people’s motivation for physical activity. In using self-determination theory as a guiding theoretical framework, it was hypothesized that after an 8-week period of wearing the Fitbit and using the Fitbit app, participants would experience greater need satisfaction, greater self-determined forms of motivation, and less amotivation. The results, however, identified significant declines in competence, autonomy, and relatedness, alongside reduced levels of autonomous motivation. Furthermore, following the 8-week period, significant increases in amotivation were observed. In contrast to previous literature suggesting that healthy lifestyle technologies can impact young people’s motivation for physical activity, 24 Schaefer SE, Ching CC, Breen H, et al. Wearing, thinking, and moving: testing the feasibility of fitness tracking with urban youth. Am J Health Educ. 2016;47:8–16. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] - 26 Ridgers N, McNarry MA, Mackintosh K. Feasibility and effectiveness of using wearable activity trackers in youth: a systematic review. J Med Int Res Mhealth Uhealth. 2016;3(4):e129. doi:10.2196/mhealth.6540. [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] data demonstrate that healthy lifestyle technologies may impact negatively on students’ motivation for physical activity.\nIn examining the relationship between the Fitbit and young people in further detail, data suggested that peer comparison was a key factor in undermining levels of competence, autonomy, and relatedness. For example, it is reported that when individuals lose in competitions, perceptions of competence and intrinsic motivation decrease. 62 Vallerand RJ, Gauvin LI, Halliwell WR. Effects of zero-sum competition on children’s motivation and perceived competence. J Soc Psychol. 1986;126:465–472. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] The competitive element provided the participants with competence/incompetence information through the social comparison of performance. Due to the leader board nature of the competitions offered on the Fitbit, inevitably, more young people are likely to receive incompetence information because only one person can be top of the leader board. Similarly, the predetermined 10 000-step goal may actually lead pupils to feel less competent when they do not achieve the daily goal, as was supported through the focus groups.\nAlthough it was previously argued that feelings of autonomy could be increased through the tailoring of physical activity goals on the Fitbit app, the decreased feelings of autonomy experienced may have been a result of the predefined targets within the device; for example, 10 000 steps. This was reflected in the qualitative evidence in which pupils focused on achieving this goal, and there was little acknowledgement toward adjusting their physical activity targets. Furthermore, it is argued 54 Vallerand RJ, Losier G. An integrative analysis on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in sport. J Appl Sport Psychol. 1999;11:142–169. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] that competition may undermine self-determined motivation through the impact on perceived autonomy and competence. Specifically, in this study, pupils engaged in step count competitions with their peers, both informally through discussions and formally through the “7 Day Steps” leader board on the Fitbit app that allows you to compare you performance with your Fitbit “friends.” If individuals feel pressured into competition or engagement, then a loss of autonomy will follow and self-determined motivation will be reduced. The qualitative evidence supports the proposed mechanism that pressure and guilt may be the process through which autonomy was undermined.\nAlthough previous research has highlighted how both face-to-face interactions and online communications can promote relatedness, 52 Downie M, Mageau GA, Koestner R. What makes for pleasant social interaction? Motivational dynamics of interpersonal relations. J Soc Psychol. 2008;148:523–534. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] it may have been the unique features of the online communications offered through the Fitbit app that led to reductions in need satisfaction. The competitive elements may create isolation from peers and thus undermine relatedness. Although the qualitative evidence suggested that some pupils found the competitive element engaging, there was also an awareness from some individuals that the competition element could also be detrimental and that engagement in physical activity could be the result of external pressure from peers.\nTheoretically, the role of competition can be explained by the compromising of the basic psychological needs that could have resulted in the evidenced reductions to autonomous motivation and increases in amotivation. Although increases in controlled motivation were not significant, data indicate that the Fitbit acted as a source of external pressure (through the achievement of goals) and internal pressure (guilt). Indeed, when individuals engage in behaviors through feelings of guilt or social approval, their behavior is controlled through introjected regulation. 44 Deci EL, Ryan RM. The “what” and “why” of goal pursuits: human needs and the self-determination of behavior. Psychol Inq. 2000;11:227–268. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] In turn, when behaviors are regulated by controlled motivation, individuals are less likely to engage in long-term maintenance of behaviors. 44 Deci EL, Ryan RM. The “what” and “why” of goal pursuits: human needs and the self-determination of behavior. Psychol Inq. 2000;11:227–268. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] , 63 Markland D, Ingledew DK. Exercise participation motives: a self-determination theory perspective. In: Hagger MS, Chatzisarantis NL, eds. Intrinsic Motivation and Self-determination in Exercise and Sport. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics; 2007:23–34.  [Google Scholar] From this perspective, the observed short-term motivational effects can be attributed to the competitive element that promoted controlled rather than autonomous motivation.\nFuture directions\nThe study has several limitations that could be developed in future research. Firstly, although the Fitbit resulted in negative motivational outcomes, the study did not include an objective assessment of physical activity; thus, the implications for actual physical activity levels cannot be established. Though data were gathered from the Fitbit as part of the wider study, data capture was inconsistent among participants and data reporting was limited due to ethical procedures adopted as part of the institutional ethical review process. Data from the Fitbit, therefore, did not yield robust and credible insight that could be reported on in this article. Future research should use a pre- and posttest assessment of physical activity in a randomized controlled trial design in order to identify how healthy lifestyle technologies influence behavioral outcomes. Empirical investigations should also consider identifying the period at which the novelty effect becomes apparent—that is, 4 weeks—and engage with weekly assessments of motivational regulation and objective physical activity assessments. Future research should also consider sampling strategies that recruit schools from a diverse range of sociodemographic backgrounds. Furthermore, multiple intervention groups could be used in future studies, in order to assess the effectiveness of different levels of educational support. For example, a comparison across no educational support and educational support of different frequencies—for example, weekly vs fortnightly goal setting and feedback activities.\nTranslation to Health Education Practice\nFinding new ways to motivate young people to be active is a clear international agenda. 5 United Nations Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. Quality Physical Education (QPE) Guidelines for Policy-Makers. Paris, France: UNESCO Publishing; 2015.  [Google Scholar] Healthy lifestyle technologies have been presented as one solution, given the increased availability and accessibility of wearable devices and health apps, alongside young people’s widespread use of, and engagement with, mobile technologies. 12 Rich E, Miah A. Mobile, wearable and ingestible health technologies: towards a critical research agenda. Health Sociol Rev. 2017;26:84–97.

Rethinking the relationship between pedagogy, technology and learning in health and physical education. Sports Educ Soc. 2017;22:288–304. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®]   [Google Scholar] Despite this, few insights have been provided on the impact of healthy lifestyle technologies on young people’s motivation for physical activity. Data from this study demonstrated that though clear potential exists, healthy lifestyle technologies negatively impact young people’s motivation for physical activity. Competition, peer comparison and social comparison to normative predetermined targets result in only short-term motivational effects. In order to promote autonomy in young people, practitioners should support children in personalizing their physical activity goals and encourage self-referenced comparisons of performance, as opposed to engaging in normative comparisons with peers or established public health discourses. This evidence suggests that young people negatively relate to dominant public health discourses of, for example, 10 000 steps, that are promoted through consumer-oriented technologies. It also highlights that peer influence through digital technologies may play a negative role in physical activity promotion in young people. This research provides evidence for practitioners to support and educate young people regarding the personalisation aspect of these devices. Finally, evidence is required from a wider sample to be able to make more substantive claims about the role of healthy lifestyle technologies in young people’s physical activity behaviors.\nTable 1.

The field campaign was based in Guam (13.5°N, 144.8°E), using the U.K. Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) BAe-146 atmospheric research aircraft, and was coordinated with the Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment (ATTREX) project with an unmanned Global Hawk and the Convective Transport of Active Species in the Tropics (CONTRAST) campaign with a Gulfstream V aircraft. Together, the three aircraft were able to make detailed measurements of atmospheric structure and composition from the ocean surface to 20 km. These measurements are providing new information about the processes influencing halogen and ozone levels in the tropical west Pacific, as well as the importance of trace-gas transport in convection for the upper troposphere and stratosphere. The FAAM aircraft made a total of 25 flights in the region between 1°S and 14°N and 130° and 155°E. It was used to sample at altitudes below 8 km, with much of the time spent in the marine boundary layer. It measured a range of chemical species and sampled extensively within the region of main inflow into the strong west Pacific convection. The CAST team also made ground-based measurements of a number of species (including daily ozonesondes) at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program site on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea (2.1°S, 147.4°E). This article presents an overview of the CAST project, focusing on the design and operation of the west Pacific experiment. It additionally discusses some new developments in CAST, including flights of new instruments on board the Global Hawk in February–March 2015.\n* CURRENT AFFILIATION: Centre for Atmospheric Informatics and Emissions Technology, Cranfield University, Cranfield, United Kingdom\nThis article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license .\nCORRESPONDING AUTHOR E-MAIL: Neil Harris, neil.harris@cranfield.ac.uk\nSection:\nThe CAST project involves studying the chemical composition of the atmosphere in the tropical warm pool region to improve our understanding of trace gas transport in convection.\nThe tropical tropopause layer (TTL) is the region of the tropical atmosphere between the main convective outflow at around 12–13 km and the base of the stratosphere at 17–18 km and is a very important region for composition–aerosol–climate interactions ( Randel and Jensen 2013 ). Its overall structure is intermediate between the troposphere and stratosphere, with a lapse rate smaller than the saturated adiabatic up to the cold point ( Fueglistaler et al. 2009 ). This is caused by the combined effect of slow radiative processes and the infrequent penetration of convective turrets to high altitudes. There is a marked longitudinal asymmetry in TTL temperatures, with a minimum in the region 130°E–180° during all times of the year. This minimum corresponds to the warm waters of the tropical warm pool (TWP) beneath, and there is an associated maximum in convection ( Gettelman et al. 2002 ). The TTL is the predominant route for troposphere-to-stratosphere transport, so that conditions in the TTL set the entry concentrations at the base of the stratosphere for, for example, stratospheric water vapor and very short-lived halogen species. Knowledge of the input into the TTL is a prerequisite for correct modeling of TTL (and hence stratospheric) composition and yet many aspects are poorly constrained ( Levine et al. 2007 ; Heyes et al. 2009 ). The couplings between the various processes are important. For example, improving the treatment of TTL water vapor and cirrus in global climate models requires a better understanding of convective transport and radiative transfer in the TTL, as well as improved model descriptions of the key processes.\nWe are still unclear about the entry and exit routes for the TTL, including how much material is transported quasi horizontally into the extratropical lowermost stratosphere ( Levine et al. 2008 ). What is the average residence time in the TTL? What is the nature, and importance for composition, of longitudinal variability within the TTL? How much of the very short-lived halogen species can pass through the TTL and so affect stratospheric ozone concentrations? Large discrepancies exist between models and measurements even for long-lived tracers. Some of these are due to transport—sharp horizontal gradients are observed in atmospheric tracers at boundaries between midlatitude, subtropical, and tropical air masses, which are not well represented by models ( Wofsy et al. 2011 )—and some to limited information on emissions [e.g., N2O and CH4 in this region; Ishijima et al. (2010) ]. These issues are more important for very short-lived substances (VSLSs, with lifetimes shorter than 6 months), including halogen-containing VSLSs with their poorly understood sources, atmospheric transformations, and geographic distributions ( Carpenter et al. 2014 ). Other effects such as the degree to which the locations of the emissions coincide with strong convection can also have a strong influence on the overall flux ( Russo et al. 2015 ).\nTo address these issues, the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) BAe-146 atmospheric research aircraft was deployed in Guam in January and February 2014 as part of the Coordinated Airborne Studies in the Tropics (CAST) campaign, a large multi-institutional project funded by the U.K. Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). In Guam, it flew alongside the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Global Hawk, a high-altitude autonomous aircraft used in the NASA Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment (ATTREX) project, and the National Science Foundation/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF/NCAR) Gulfstream V (GV) in the NSF Convective Transport of Active Species in the Tropics (CONTRAST) project, as described in the companion papers by Jensen et al. (2017) and Pan et al. (2017) . The measurements from all three campaigns are being jointly used to diagnose how air is carried high into the atmosphere.\nThe value inherent in having the three aircraft flying together was found in the ability to measure from the surface up into the stratosphere (see Fig. 1 in Pan et al. 2017 ). The instrument payloads on the three aircraft made many common measurements, which together have combined to provide a comprehensive dataset for interpretative studies. However, within this larger picture, each aircraft had its own scientific aims and objectives, which were appropriate to the specific aircraft’s capabilities. The Global Hawk made measurements in the upper TTL (14–20 km), including in the outflow of convection. The GV aircraft principally sampled at the same altitudes as the main convective outflow (9–15 km) and, additionally, made measurements on profiles down into the boundary layer. In the case of the FAAM aircraft, the aims were to a) investigate halocarbon production in the marine boundary layer and b) characterize the composition of air in the main convective inflow. Knowledge of the distributions of trace gases in the boundary layer and lower troposphere is needed to estimate the flux of these gases into the TTL. The role of the FAAM research aircraft was to fly over the tropical west Pacific and to measure the composition in the lower troposphere (0–8 km). These measurements characterize the air masses in the region of the main convective inflow and so are valuable in interpreting the higher-altitude measurements of the Global Hawk and the GV made during the same period. They can also be used to improve our understanding of marine halocarbon production and to investigate the influence of polluted outflow from Asia. Additional measurements were made on Manus, Papua New Guinea.\nThe majority of this paper describes the CAST measurements during January–February 2014, as well as the flight planning tools used for the FAAM aircraft and for linking its measurements with those made by the other aircraft. Some early results are also discussed. The second CAST goal is to develop the U.K. capability to use autonomous aircraft for atmospheric research. Here, in addition to learning about deploying the Global Hawk and using the data collected, CAST scientists have produced two new instruments for use on the Global Hawk, which flew over the east Pacific during February–March 2015. These are described in the final section.\nCAST MEASUREMENTS.\nSection:\nMeasurements were made on two main platforms in the west Pacific. The FAAM BAe-146 research aircraft was based at the A. B. Won Pat International Airport, Guam (13.5°N, 144.8°E). The FAAM aircraft was collocated with the NCAR Gulfstream while the NASA Global Hawk was based at Andersen Air Force Base, approximately 30 km to the northeast. A suite of ground-based instrument systems was based at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) facility at Manus (2.1°S, 147.4°E), in order to characterize the tropospheric composition beyond the range of the FAAM aircraft.\nFlight planning.\nThe goal of the CAST FAAM flights was to characterize the inflow to convection in the lower troposphere in the west Pacific. To extend the range of the aircraft so that it could reach into the upwelling area near the equator, overnight stops were planned at the islands of Palau (Roman Tmetuchl International Airport, Babeldaob island, Republic of Palau; 7.4°N, 134.5°E) and Chuuk (Chuuk International Airport, Weno Island, Federated States of Micronesia; 7.5°N, 151.8°E). When conditions allowed, transects were made at 100 feet (30.5 m) [with occasional dips down to 50 ft (15.2 m)] over the open ocean to give the opportunity to sample air influenced by fresh ocean emissions. Stacked runs with horizontal legs at different altitudes were planned where possible to provide information about the vertical profile of the short-lived species in the lower troposphere. A large part of the flight planning for the FAAM research aircraft was to ensure good coverage of the lower troposphere within range from Guam.\nChemical forecast products were provided by the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) project in support of all three field campaigns. MACC assimilates comprehensive global observations of chemical composition into the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) meteorological forecasting system ( Flemming et al. 2015 ). The operational MACC system runs at 80-km horizontal resolution (T255) with 60 vertical levels. During the campaign, forecast plots for the operation domain were provided for a number of chemical species, including the FAAM measurements: O3, CO, CH4, black carbon, NO, and NO2. In addition, a number of hypothetical tracers were included to track air originating from different locations (e.g., regional emissions from China and India). A coastal emission tracer was used to track oceanic emissions of CHBr3 and other short-lived halocarbons since these are preferentially released in coastal regions ( Carpenter et al. 2009 ; Ashfold et al. 2014 ).\nLinking measurements.\nTo have near-real-time information about the air reaching the TTL from the lower troposphere, the trajectory-based approach of Ashfold et al. (2012) was adapted to meet the needs of a multiaircraft campaign. In this, the Numerical Atmospheric-Dispersion Modeling Environment (NAME) was run as an adjunct to the Met Office operational forecasting model so that it could access meteorological forecasts on a time scale quick enough to provide useful flight-planning information. The starting grid for the trajectories covered a large area of the west Pacific ( Fig. 7 ), with trajectories being released at altitudes between 8 and 18 km. Twelve-day backward trajectories were then calculated using a mixture of Met Office analyses and forecasts, so that information was available about the possible influence of lower-tropospheric air in the regions that could be sampled by the Global Hawk and the GV. Each day, trajectories were produced for 1, 2, 3 and 5 days into the future. In each 2-km-altitude layer, 5,000 particles were released in each 10° × 10° box. During the campaign, these calculations were made for a larger area at higher altitudes to reflect the larger range of the Global Hawk. The horizontal resolution of the Met Office operational model was 25 km in early 2014.\nAn example is shown in Fig. 1 for three altitude ranges (12–14, 14–16, and 16–18 km). Each point is the end point of each parcel of air that had crossed below 1 km in the preceding 12 days. For graphical clarity, only a fraction of the trajectories are shown at each level. Thus, strong, predicted low-level influence is indicated by a high percentage in each box (shown by the number), and at a given level by the denser clouds. These maps were routinely checked against flight plans for the Global Hawk and the GV to ensure that a wide range of low-level influences was sampled. In general, most flight plans met these criteria as a result of the proximity of the aircraft to the main convective region.\nView larger version (64K)\nFig. 1. Examples of trajectory-based forecast products used for multiaircraft flight planning. These plots are for 13 Feb 2014 when all three aircraft were in the same region [see Fig. 7 in Pan et al. (2016)]. The three panels show the location of air parcels which had been below 1-km altitude in the preceding 12 days at (a) 16–18, (b) 14–16, and (c) 12–14 km. The number in each box is the percentage of parcels in that box from below 1 km in the preceding 12 days. During the campaign, they were available as 1-, 3-, and 5-day forecasts for flight planning, and the NAME model was driven by analyses and forecasts from the Met Office operational model run at 25-km horizontal resolution.\nFAAM BAe-146 aircraft.\nThe FAAM BAe-146 has a science payload of up to 4 tons (∼3630 kg) devised according to the objectives of a particular campaign. The chemical composition of the tropical atmosphere is the focus of CAST and this dictated the scientific payload. The chemical species and physical parameters measured on the FAAM aircraft, along with the instruments used, are summarized in Table 1 . Trace gases with a wide range of atmospheric lifetimes, sources, and sinks were measured in order to provide information about the origin and fate of the air masses encountered, as well as about the atmospheric time scales involved. In many cases these species were also measured by the Global Hawk and/or the GV aircraft, giving good synergy between the three datasets. Understanding the distribution and chemistry of halogen species is a special focus for all three campaigns and this is reflected in the FAAM payload.\nTable 1. Instruments and measurements made by the BAe-146 (FAAM) aircraft during the CAST project. Also indicated are the synergy with other aircraft from the CONTRAST (GV) and ATTREX (Global Hawk) projects.\nTable 1. Instruments and measurements made by the BAe-146 (FAAM) aircraft during the CAST project. Also indicated are the synergy with other aircraft from the CONTRAST (GV) and ATTREX (Global Hawk) projects.\nImage of typeset table\nWhole air samples (WASs) were collected as described in Andrews et al. (2013) . Analysis of WAS canisters was carried out in the aircraft hangar, usually within 72 h of collection. Two liters of sample air were preconcentrated using a thermal desorption unit (Markes Unity2 CIA-T) and analyzed with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS; Agilent 7890 GC, 5977 Xtr MSD). Halocarbons were quantified using a NOAA calibration gas standard. Dimethylsulfide was quantified using a secondary standard prepared and referenced to a primary [Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS)] standard. The full method is detailed in Andrews et al. (2013 , 2016) .\nMeasurements of a subset of halocarbons and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were made in flight using a new thermal desorption (TD) GC-MS system. A 1-L sample of air, drawn from a window blank inlet, pressurized to 2.5 atm (1 atm = 101,325 Pa), and dried using a multicore countercurrent nafion drier, was alternately preconcentrated or analyzed from two parallel adsorption traps (Tenax TA) of a two-channel TD system (Markes International, model TT 24/7). Analyses were refocused at the head of the column using liquid CO2 prior to separation (10 m, 180-μm inner diameter, 1-μm film, Restek RTX502.2 column; 40°–150°C at 40°C min−1) by GC (Agilent 6850) and detection by electron impact MS single-ion monitoring (Agilent 5975C), calibrated preflight against the WAS gas standard (NOAA, SX-3581). The instrument temporal resolution, and associated sample integration period, was 5 min.\nThe chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) from the Georgia Institute of Technology was configured similarly to previous deployments ( Le Breton et al. 2012 , 2013 ). The I− ionization scheme was used to detect inorganic halogens, carboxylic acids, HCN, and other trace species. For CAST, the CIMS made simultaneous measurements of BrO, BrCl, Br2, and HOBr. The 1-Hz data were averaged to 30 s for analysis. Precampaign and postflight laboratory calibrations were used relative to in-flight formic acid calibrations to quantify the sensitivities and limits of detection for the inorganic halogens, similar to that used for dinitrogen pentoxide ( Le Breton et al. 2014 ). The sensitivities ranged from 1 to 50 ion counts per part per trillion per second (ppt−1 s−1) determined by in-flight and postcampaign calibrations. The limits of detection for species varied from 0.36 to 37 ppt for 30-s-averaged data. (All mixing ratios given in this paper are by volume.) An acid scrubber was used to quantify the background signal in the instrument and inlet line.\nA broadband cavity-en-hanced absorption spectrometer (BBCEAS) was adapted to measure input/output (IO) in the 410–482-nm-wavelength region. No clear absorption feature was observable from spectra by eye with up to 100-s averaging, pointing to very low mixing ratios (<∼0.5 ppt) of IO over the sampled area. When using averaged data, a small positive bias (∼0.3 ppt) of IO was observed with respect to zero. These observations appear to support the existence of IO in the remote marine boundary layer at sub-ppt levels, but the limited sensitivity precludes robust identification of spatial gradients.\nNitrous oxide was measured using chemiluminescence and NO2 was quantified via a second channel, with NO2 being converted to NO using a blue-light LED converter centered at 395 nm. The NO2 mixing ratio is derived from the difference between the total NOx and NO mixing ratios. The instrument is calibrated via addition of 5 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) of known NO concentration to the ambient sample. The conversion efficiency of the LED converter is measured in each calibration using gas-phase titration of NO to NO2 on addition of O3. In-flight calibrations were conducted above the boundary layer to ensure stable low levels of NOx with before- and after-flight calibrations made using an overflow at the inlet of zero-grade air. A more detailed description of a similar system can be found in Lee et al. (2009) .\nThe level of O3 was measured by an ultraviolet (UV) absorption photometer (Thermo Fisher, model 49C), traceable to the U.K. National Physical Laboratory primary ozone standard with an uncertainty of 2% and a precision of 1 ppb for 4-s measurements.\nThe CO level was measured by a vacuum UV fluorescence analyzer [Aero Laser GmbH, model AL5002; Gerbig et al. (1999) ]. The instrument was calibrated in flight approximately every 45 min using a synthetic-air working standard (Air Liquide, ∼500 ppb), traceable to the NOAA/Earth System Research Laboratory [Global Monitoring Division-Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases Group (GMD-CCGG)] surveillance standard and the World Meteorological Organization CO-scale X2004. The 1-Hz CO measurements have a 2% uncertainty and 3-ppb precision.\nThe CO2 and CH4 levels were measured by a cavity-enhanced IR absorption spectrometer (Los Gatos Research, Inc., fast greenhouse gas analyzer, model RMT-200). The instrument was customized for airborne operations ( O’Shea et al. 2013 ), so CO2 and CH4 dry mole fractions can be linearized in flight using natural-air working standards, traceable to the World Meteorological Organization CO2-scale X2007 and CH4-scale X2004. The performance of the system is estimated from one standard deviation of all in-flight “target” calibration data. The 1-Hz measurement precisions are estimated at 0.7 ppm and 2.5 ppb for CO2 and CH4, respectively. Through the addition of all known uncertainties, we estimate a total accuracy of ±1.3 ppb for CH4 and ±0.2 ppm for CO2.\nThe Passive Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer Probe 100-X (PCASP), upgraded with the SPP-200 electronics package from Droplet Measurement Technologies (DMT), measures aerosol particles with nominal diameters of 0.1–3 µm. Light from a 0.6328-µm laser is scattered by the particles and a photodetector sums the forward (over solid angles subtended by 35°–120°) and backward (60°–145°) scattered light. The probe is canister mounted under the wing and was operated at 1 Hz. The instrument was calibrated for particle size before and after the campaign. Uncertainties exist in both the sizing and the counting of particles and these are discussed, along with the calibration procedure, in Rosenberg et al. (2012) .\nThe DMT Cloud Droplet Probe (CDP; Lance et al. 2010 ) was flown on the same under-wing pylon as the PCASP. The CDP is an open-path instrument that measures the forward-scattered light (over solid angles nominally subtended by 1.7°–14°) from the 0.658-µm incident laser beam. Particles are assigned to 1 of 30 size bins over the nominal size range 3–50 µm. Calibration with certified diameter glass beads was carried out before each flight ( Rosenberg et al. 2012 ). The sample rate of the CDP was the same as for the PCASP, 1 Hz.\nManus.\nObservations started at the ARM climate facility on Manus during October 1996 ( Mather et al. 1998 ) and continued until August 2014. These observations provided the basis for many studies of the climate in the west Pacific (e.g., Long et al. 2013 and references therein). In February 2014, a suite of ground-based instruments was deployed as part of CAST to make measurements of ozone (ground and profile), short-lived halocarbons, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane. The instruments used are now described and are also summarized in Table 2 .\nTable 2. Measurements made at the ARM site at Manus during CAST. Information about the meteorological measurements from Manus can be found online ( www.arm.gov/sites/twp/C1/instruments ).\nTable 2. Measurements made at the ARM site at Manus during CAST. Information about the meteorological measurements from Manus can be found online ( www.arm.gov/sites/twp/C1/instruments ).\nImage of typeset table\nOzone profiles were measured using ozonesondes. Air is pumped through a potassium–iodine (KI) solution in a cathode half-cell, with two electrons produced for each ozone molecule; the cell current is directly proportional to the flow of ozone through the cell. Ozonesondes have a typical response time of about 1 min at the tropopause level, with a precision of a few parts per billion. In the TTL the accuracy of the measurement is dominated by the background current ( Newton et al. 2016 and references therein). Simultaneously, vertical profiles of temperature, humidity, wind, and pressure were measured with Vaisala RS92 radiosondes.\nGround-level ozone was measured by a Thermo-Electric Corporation TE49C, which is a dual-channel ultraviolet photometer measuring ozone through absorption of radiation at 254 nm. The incoming airstream is split between two identical cells, with a scrubber removing ozone from one of the streams. The TE49C provides a measurement every 10 s and has a 20-s response time.\nGround-level trace-gas concentrations were measured by a Picarro Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer G2401 (CRDS; Crosson 2008 ). The sample air inlet was at about 8 m above ground level with a rain cover and a 2-µm particulate filter. Water vapor in the instrument was kept below 1.5 ppm and was controlled by passing the sample flow (∼250 mL min−1) through a chiller at approximately 5°C and then through a desiccant-based nafion drier. CO2 and CH4 concentrations were recorded every 5 s, with precisions of ∼1 and ∼200 ppb, respectively. Calibrations were achieved using a target gas (CH4, 2024 ppb; CO2, 390 ppm) measured every 2 days for 10 min with low and high calibration runs on intermediate days [low (high): CH4, 1919 (2736) ppb; CO2, 360 (495) ppm]. The calibration gases are linked to the NOAA–WMO calibration scale.\nSurface concentrations of short-lived halocarbons were measured using a µDirac instrument, a gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD) based on an instrument described in Gostlow et al. (2010) but with a 10-m separation column. The instrument sampled ambient air from the roughly 8-m-high mast, with a 10–20 mL min–1 flow dried using a counterflow nafion drier. Calibration runs, using a NOAA/ESRL air cylinder spiked with the target compounds, were conducted regularly (every three samples). The calibration volumes ranged from 3 to 50 mL to allow correction for drifts in instrument sensitivity and linearity. Measurement precision is species dependent, typically 2%–10% (plus or minus one standard deviation), with accuracy in the range of 5%–10% (plus or minus one standard deviation).\nOVERVIEW OF MEASUREMENTS.\nSection:\nThe FAAM BAe-146 made a total of 25 science flights totaling 90 flight hours during the CAST deployment in the west Pacific ( Fig. 2 ). Brief summaries of the flights are given in Table 3 . The flight tracks are shown in Fig. 2 , with the altitude represented by the color of the line. The large majority of the flights were below 5-km altitude, with a significant fraction in the marine boundary layer (below about 1 km), with good coverage between 2°S and 14°N and 130° and 160°E.\nView larger version (78K)\nFig. 2. Map of FAAM BAe-146 flight tracks during Jan–Feb 2014. The flight tracks are colored by altitude. The islands of Guam, Palau, and Chuuk are marked. The background shows Jan–Feb-averaged Chl-a concentrations in 2014, measured by the MODIS satellite [NASA Giovanni: Acker and Leptoukh (2007) ]. The inset shows an enlarged area around Chuuk atoll.\nTable 3. Research flights made by the BAe-146 (FAAM) aircraft during the CAST project.\nTable 3. Research flights made by the BAe-146 (FAAM) aircraft during the CAST project.\nImage of typeset table\nThe vertical distribution of the science flights can also be seen in Fig. 3 , which shows O3 and CO concentrations as a function of altitude and latitude. In general, lower O3 values are found in the marine boundary layer and at lower latitudes, while high values are found at higher altitudes and at higher latitudes. There is no obvious correlation with CO. However, when the O3 and CO data are plotted against each other ( Fig. 4 ), a bimodal relationship emerges. Further, the lower ozone values (10–40 ppb) occur when the relative humidity is high ( Fig. 4 , top). This finding reinforces that of Pan et al. (2015) , who report this bimodality throughout the altitude range covered by the NCAR GV, with a background mode of nearly constant (∼20 ppb) values throughout the troposphere and a secondary mode of higher ozone (∼35–95 ppb) in layers with lower relative humidity. The previously reported S-shaped mean profile ( Folkins et al. 2002 ) results from averaging the two modes.\nView larger version (44K)\nFig. 3. (top left) Ozone and (top right) carbon monoxide mixing ratios measured during all CAST flights as a function of latitude and altitude. (right) The means and associated two standard deviations of ozone and carbon monoxide are shown as a function of altitude. See text and Table 1 for instrumental details.\nView larger version (44K)\nFig. 4. Plots of O3 against CO colored by (bottom) NO and (top) relative humidity (10-s-averaged data).\nThe CAST measurements ( Fig. 4 ) show that high ozone and lower relative humidity often occurs with higher NO concentrations and does not occur with low CO concentrations. Preliminary analysis of the high NO measurements indicates that the air masses encountered had previously been in regions close to anthropogenic activities and/or biomass burning. For example, the MACC forecasts show the transport of biomass burning and Southeast Asian tracers to the west Pacific. The possible role of biomass burning has been thoroughly investigated by Anderson et al. (2016) using CAST and CONTRAST measurements. The presence of HCN, CH3CN, and other tracers in the high-ozone levels is explained by biomass-burning plumes, which are convectively lofted into the free troposphere undergoing dehydration during the convection. As this air descends, its relative humidity drops and ozone is produced photochemically.\nThe CHBr3 concentrations measured with the Whole Air Sampler and the onboard GC-MS are shown in Fig. 5 . In general the values are low, with even the higher values not far above the background values seen in this region ( Brinckmann et al. 2012 ). The lower amounts of CHBr3 were encountered out of the boundary layer ( Fig. 4b ). The background in Fig. 2 shows that the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in the surface waters of the west Pacific were low during this period. Higher Chl-a values are seen in the shallower waters approaching the islands of the Maritime Continent. The lagoon inside Chuuk atoll is relatively shallow (<60 m) and is embedded in much deeper ocean waters. It has a circumference of about 200 km and an area of about 3000 km2. If halocarbons are emitted preferentially in shallow waters ( Carpenter et al. 2009 ), then it should be discernible as an emission hotspot. The influence of short-lived halocarbon emissions from shallower waters was investigated during the FAAM flights by circling Chuuk atoll at low altitudes. The inset in Fig. 5a shows the CHBr3 observed on these flights as well as the instantaneous wind speed observed by the FAAM aircraft. Higher concentrations of CHBr3 (red) are found when air has previously passed over the atoll, indicating that the atoll is a source of CHBr3.\nView larger version (44K)\nFig. 5. CHBr3 mixing ratios (colors) sampled by the FAAM aircraft during CAST using the whole air sampler (squares) and the onboard GC-MS (circles). (a) All measurements made at altitudes less than 1 km. The enlarged inset shows the values around the Chuuk atoll. The lines associated with each measurement in the inset indicate the instantaneous wind speed measured by the aircraft. (b) The measurements at altitudes greater than 1 km. The inset shows the vertical profile of all measurements.\nThe NAME model driven by Met Office analyzed fields has been used to interpret the CHBr3 and other brominated VSLS measurements made near the tropopause on the Global Hawk in the east Pacific during 2013 and the west Pacific during 2014 ( Navarro et al. 2015 ). The approach is similar to the forecast information produced during the campaign (see above). They find that the majority of air recently injected into the TTL had come from the west Pacific in both years with similar amounts, approximately 6 (4–9) ppt, of combined organic and inorganic bromine derived from brominated VSLS.\nAt the ARM facility in Manus, CHBr3 was also observed ( Fig. 5 ). The median value in this period was 0.81 ppt, about half that previously observed at a coastal site in Malaysian Borneo ( Robinson et al. 2014 ) and similar to the values observed on the FAAM aircraft ( Fig. 4 ). A strong diurnal cycle is seen in early February in several trace gases measured at Manus with increased nocturnal amounts, providing evidence for local nighttime sources of CO2, CH4, CHBr3, and CH3I. This diurnal pattern of behavior was seen from 3 to 12 February when the winds were low and a stable boundary layer was able to form. Before and after this period winds were higher and the nighttime buildup was much less.\nTogether, the CHBr3 observations appear to be consistent with past work focused on Southeast Asia. Elevated levels are frequently observed close to coasts (e.g., Pyle et al. 2011 ) or above shallow waters, but measurements collected a relatively small distance away (less than a typical global model grid cell) rarely contain above-background levels of CHBr3. This suggests that coasts are not a large source in a regional/global sense (as found by Ashfold et al. 2014 ), and for coastal CHBr3 emissions to contribute significantly to the TTL and stratosphere would require collocation of convection ( Russo et al. 2015 ).\nGround-based ozone at Manus showed decreases at night in the quiescent period from a peak daytime value of 10 to <5-ppb levels which is consistent with oxidative uptake to the local vegetation ( Fig. 6 ). This is the only time such low values of ozone were seen in CAST. In the absence of local sources, C2Cl4 is a good tracer of large-scale transport, and its concentrations during this period were generally in the range 1–1.5 ppt, which is typical of results seen in the clean west Pacific ( Ashfold et al. 2015 ). Manus was mainly influenced by flow from the north throughout this period.\nView larger version (103K)\nFig. 6. Surface observations of (top to bottom) wind, O3, CO2, CH4, C2Cl4, CHBr3, and CH3I at the ARM facility on Manus from 1 to 24 Feb 2014. The time shown along the x axis is universal time. The shading indicates the local time, with the darker bands representing nighttime.\nA total of 39 ozonesondes were launched from Manus in February 2014, with 34 sondes providing good ozone profiles ( Fig. 7a ; Newton et al. 2016 ). These measurements are most difficult in the tropics as the ozone concentrations are low, so that any error in estimating the background current is important. Particular attention was therefore paid to measurements of the background current, leading to recommendations for changes to the standard operation procedures used in the sonde preparation. Support for this approach is provided by good agreement in a coordinated ozonesonde–GV flight (see Fig. 14 in Pan et al. 2017 ). The ozone measurements are shown in Fig. 7 alongside the corresponding MACC 1- and 4-day forecasts. The forecasts predicted the main characteristics of the observations such as increased ozone at about 400 hPa from 14 to 16 February and the low concentrations near the TTL from 19 to 23 February. The minimum reproducible ozone concentration measured in the TTL was 12 ppb, consistent with the minimum of 13 ppb measured by the GV during CONTRAST ( Pan et al. 2017 ).\nFig. 7. (left) Daily observed ozone profile in Manus and corresponding MACC forecasts with lead times of (center) 1 and (right) 4 days.\nNew technology developments.\nAs part of the collaboration with ATTREX, three new developments were included in CAST: two instruments for use on the Global Hawk, the Aerosol–Ice–Interface Transition Spectrometer (AIITS) and the Greenhouse Gas Observations in the Stratosphere and Troposphere (GHOST), along with a software tool, Real-Time Atmospheric Science Cluster Analysis (RASCAL), designed to assist aircraft scientists by performing real-time data analysis during flights. The two new instruments were flown for a total of 40 h during one test flight and two science flights in February–March 2015 from the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center, Edwards Air Force Base, California. They were part of a payload that also included Hawkeye, the NOAA H2O and O3 instruments, the Global Hawk Whole Air Sampler (GWAS), and the Microwave Temperature Profiler (MTP) (see Jensen et al. 2017 for more details).\nAIITS was designed to probe different cirrus regimes in the TTL in order to understand fundamental nucleation and sublimation processes influencing the stratospheric water budget and fluxes, as well as the potential impact of biomass burning on cirrus ice crystal activation and growth. It is the next instrument in the Small Ice Detector (SID) family ( Hirst et al. 2001 ; Kaye et al. 2008 ). AIITS acquires 2D forward-scattering patterns from particles in the size range from about one to a few hundred micrometers and can measure the depolarization in backward and forward scattering. The patterns allow quantification of the phase, habit, and fine surface features of large aerosol and small ice crystals in the size range 2–100 µm ( Cotton et al. 2010 ; Ulanowski et al. 2014 ). Unique results were obtained by AIITS during cirrus penetrations at 16.5 km and at temperatures down to -80°C ( Fig. 8 ). These revealed a transition to smooth quasi-spherical ice particle regimes in specific regions of TTL layers in response to changing supersaturation regimes. The impact on the radiative scattering properties of cirrus in these regimes is being investigated.\nView larger version (60K)\nFig. 8. AIITS scattering patterns recorded from ice particles in the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS), at altitudes of about 16 km and temperatures of about –80°C. The pictures are indicative of (left) a smooth quasi-spherical ice particle, (center) a columnar crystal, and (right) a pristine hexagonal plate.\nGHOST is a novel grating spectrometer designed for remote sensing of greenhouse gases from aircraft ( Humpage et al. 2014 ). It measures spectrally resolved shortwave-infrared radiance across four spectral bands from 1.27 to 2.3 µm, with a spectral resolution between 0.1 and 0.3 nm. An optical gimbal underneath the aircraft is programmed to pass solar radiation reflected from the ocean surface through a fiber optic bundle into the spectrometer with a single grating and detector for all four bands. The bands are chosen to include absorption bands for CO2 and CH4 as well as CO, H2O, and O2; O2 is used to infer information on the scattering contributions toward the measured light. The third Global Hawk flight of the CAST/ATTREX campaign targeted the overpasses of two greenhouse gas observing satellites during clear-sky conditions over the eastern Pacific ( Fig. 9 ): the NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Greenhouse Gas Observing Satellite (GOSAT). This Global Hawk flight therefore provides a very useful validation dataset for these satellites, since they both make greenhouse gas measurements using a spectral range similar to that of GHOST.\nView larger version (87K)\nFig. 9. Flight path of the NASA Global Hawk on 10 Mar 2015 (blue). The OCO-2 (green) and GOSAT (red) soundings are shown and coincide temporally with the flight leg between 25°N, 127°W and 18°N, 125°W. MODIS cloud fraction data (see gray scale bar; Platnick et al. 2015 ) coincident with the OCO-2 overpass at 2140 UTC shows the largely cloud-free conditions encountered during this leg of the flight.\nAs real-time data becomes increasingly available, mission scientists are faced with a potentially overwhelming data torrent, from which they are required to find the information on which to base decisions. At present, mission scientists often focus on a subset of the data stream, limiting the depth of the analysis that can be carried out. As part of CAST, a new software framework, RASCAL, has been developed based on recent developments in arbitrarily shaped cluster detection algorithms ( Hyde and Angelov 2015 ). It interfaces intuitively with mission scientist expert knowledge and provides real-time on-the-fly cluster and anomaly detection (i.e., for real-time diagnosis of structures such as those presented in Fig. 4 , for example, but tested simultaneously across many chemical “dimensions”). The data stream can be separated in real time, without a priori assumptions about parameter relationships, to reveal different data groups and hence isolate specific regions of interest that can be revisited virtually postflight. In combination with the expert knowledge of the mission scientists, support tools like RASCAL have the potential to be used on many research aircraft, potentially adding significant value to the results achieved in field measurement campaigns.\nSUMMARY.\nSection:\nBased in Guam as part of a joint deployment with the NASA ATTREX Global Hawk and the NSF CONTRAST GV, the FAAM research aircraft deployment during CAST has provided an excellent characterization of the lower-tropospheric atmospheric composition in the tropical warm pool region. The majority of the FAAM aircraft flights were below 5-km altitude, and a significant fraction was in the marine boundary layer with good coverage from 2°S to 14°N and from 130° to 160°E. A suite of organic and inorganic halogen compounds was measured, with the bromine-containing species being particularly well covered.\nGround-based measurements were made at the ARM facility on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, during February 2014. These measurements characterize the tropospheric composition just south of the equator in a region inaccessible to the FAAM aircraft in this deployment. The Manus ozonesonde measurements are a valuable resource, providing a good picture of the vertical distribution of ozone in the tropical warm pool region during February with a minimum ozone concentration in the TTL of 12 ppb.\nThese measurements are being interpreted by CAST scientists in conjunction with measurements from ATTREX and CONTRAST using a range of modeling and data analysis approaches. The CAST data are stored at the British Atmospheric Data Centre ( http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/ ), and interested parties are encouraged to use them for their own studies. All users are strongly encouraged to involve the responsible instrument scientists in these studies in order to gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of these data.\nNever before has the atmosphere over the west Pacific been observed in such detail, particularly the chemical composition, with three aircraft covering all altitudes from 0 to 20 km. New insights are starting to emerge with a much improved understanding of the tropical ozone distribution ( Pan et al. 2015 ; Anderson et al. 2016 ; Newton et al. 2016 ). These findings will be underpinned by advances in the understanding of halogen distribution ( Navarro et al. 2015 ) and chemistry building on the new tropospheric halogen measurements and modeling ( Sherwen et al. 2016 ). Such research will lead to a much greater quantitative understanding of the role of a) VSLS reaching the stratosphere and b) how halogen chemistry affects tropospheric ozone over the tropical oceans. Similar advances can be expected with respect to transport and dynamics, the role of cirrus clouds in climate, and dehydration of the stratosphere. The benefits of this unique, coordinated campaign are just starting to become clear.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nCAST is funded by NERC and STFC, with Grants NE/ I030054/1 (lead award), NE/J006262/1, NE/J006238/1, NE/J006181/1, NE/J006211/1, NE/J006061/1, NE/J006157/1, NE/J006203/1, NE/J00619X/1, and NE/J006173/1.

The field campaign was based in Guam (13.5°N, 144.8°E), using the U.K. Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) BAe-146 atmospheric research aircraft, and was coordinated with the Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment (ATTREX) project with an unmanned Global Hawk and the Convective Transport of Active Species in the Tropics (CONTRAST) campaign with a Gulfstream V aircraft. Together, the three aircraft were able to make detailed measurements of atmospheric structure and composition from the ocean surface to 20 km. These measurements are providing new information about the processes influencing halogen and ozone levels in the tropical west Pacific, as well as the importance of trace-gas transport in convection for the upper troposphere and stratosphere. The FAAM aircraft made a total of 25 flights in the region between 1°S and 14°N and 130° and 155°E. It was used to sample at altitudes below 8 km, with much of the time spent in the marine boundary layer. It measured a range of chemical species and sampled extensively within the region of main inflow into the strong west Pacific convection. The CAST team also made ground-based measurements of a number of species (including daily ozonesondes) at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program site on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea (2.1°S, 147.4°E). This article presents an overview of the CAST project, focusing on the design and operation of the west Pacific experiment. It additionally discusses some new developments in CAST, including flights of new instruments on board the Global Hawk in February–March 2015.\n* CURRENT AFFILIATION: Centre for Atmospheric Informatics and Emissions Technology, Cranfield University, Cranfield, United Kingdom\nThis article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license .\nCORRESPONDING AUTHOR E-MAIL: Neil Harris, neil.harris@cranfield.ac.uk\nSection:\nThe CAST project involves studying the chemical composition of the atmosphere in the tropical warm pool region to improve our understanding of trace gas transport in convection.\nThe tropical tropopause layer (TTL) is the region of the tropical atmosphere between the main convective outflow at around 12–13 km and the base of the stratosphere at 17–18 km and is a very important region for composition–aerosol–climate interactions ( Randel and Jensen 2013 ). Its overall structure is intermediate between the troposphere and stratosphere, with a lapse rate smaller than the saturated adiabatic up to the cold point ( Fueglistaler et al. 2009 ). This is caused by the combined effect of slow radiative processes and the infrequent penetration of convective turrets to high altitudes. There is a marked longitudinal asymmetry in TTL temperatures, with a minimum in the region 130°E–180° during all times of the year. This minimum corresponds to the warm waters of the tropical warm pool (TWP) beneath, and there is an associated maximum in convection ( Gettelman et al. 2002 ). The TTL is the predominant route for troposphere-to-stratosphere transport, so that conditions in the TTL set the entry concentrations at the base of the stratosphere for, for example, stratospheric water vapor and very short-lived halogen species. Knowledge of the input into the TTL is a prerequisite for correct modeling of TTL (and hence stratospheric) composition and yet many aspects are poorly constrained ( Levine et al. 2007 ; Heyes et al. 2009 ). The couplings between the various processes are important. For example, improving the treatment of TTL water vapor and cirrus in global climate models requires a better understanding of convective transport and radiative transfer in the TTL, as well as improved model descriptions of the key processes.\nWe are still unclear about the entry and exit routes for the TTL, including how much material is transported quasi horizontally into the extratropical lowermost stratosphere ( Levine et al. 2008 ). What is the average residence time in the TTL? What is the nature, and importance for composition, of longitudinal variability within the TTL? How much of the very short-lived halogen species can pass through the TTL and so affect stratospheric ozone concentrations? Large discrepancies exist between models and measurements even for long-lived tracers. Some of these are due to transport—sharp horizontal gradients are observed in atmospheric tracers at boundaries between midlatitude, subtropical, and tropical air masses, which are not well represented by models ( Wofsy et al. 2011 )—and some to limited information on emissions [e.g., N2O and CH4 in this region; Ishijima et al. (2010) ]. These issues are more important for very short-lived substances (VSLSs, with lifetimes shorter than 6 months), including halogen-containing VSLSs with their poorly understood sources, atmospheric transformations, and geographic distributions ( Carpenter et al. 2014 ). Other effects such as the degree to which the locations of the emissions coincide with strong convection can also have a strong influence on the overall flux ( Russo et al. 2015 ).\nTo address these issues, the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) BAe-146 atmospheric research aircraft was deployed in Guam in January and February 2014 as part of the Coordinated Airborne Studies in the Tropics (CAST) campaign, a large multi-institutional project funded by the U.K. Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). In Guam, it flew alongside the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Global Hawk, a high-altitude autonomous aircraft used in the NASA Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment (ATTREX) project, and the National Science Foundation/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF/NCAR) Gulfstream V (GV) in the NSF Convective Transport of Active Species in the Tropics (CONTRAST) project, as described in the companion papers by Jensen et al. (2017) and Pan et al. (2017) . The measurements from all three campaigns are being jointly used to diagnose how air is carried high into the atmosphere.\nThe value inherent in having the three aircraft flying together was found in the ability to measure from the surface up into the stratosphere (see Fig. 1 in Pan et al. 2017 ). The instrument payloads on the three aircraft made many common measurements, which together have combined to provide a comprehensive dataset for interpretative studies. However, within this larger picture, each aircraft had its own scientific aims and objectives, which were appropriate to the specific aircraft’s capabilities. The Global Hawk made measurements in the upper TTL (14–20 km), including in the outflow of convection. The GV aircraft principally sampled at the same altitudes as the main convective outflow (9–15 km) and, additionally, made measurements on profiles down into the boundary layer. In the case of the FAAM aircraft, the aims were to a) investigate halocarbon production in the marine boundary layer and b) characterize the composition of air in the main convective inflow. Knowledge of the distributions of trace gases in the boundary layer and lower troposphere is needed to estimate the flux of these gases into the TTL. The role of the FAAM research aircraft was to fly over the tropical west Pacific and to measure the composition in the lower troposphere (0–8 km). These measurements characterize the air masses in the region of the main convective inflow and so are valuable in interpreting the higher-altitude measurements of the Global Hawk and the GV made during the same period. They can also be used to improve our understanding of marine halocarbon production and to investigate the influence of polluted outflow from Asia. Additional measurements were made on Manus, Papua New Guinea.\nThe majority of this paper describes the CAST measurements during January–February 2014, as well as the flight planning tools used for the FAAM aircraft and for linking its measurements with those made by the other aircraft. Some early results are also discussed. The second CAST goal is to develop the U.K. capability to use autonomous aircraft for atmospheric research. Here, in addition to learning about deploying the Global Hawk and using the data collected, CAST scientists have produced two new instruments for use on the Global Hawk, which flew over the east Pacific during February–March 2015. These are described in the final section.\nCAST MEASUREMENTS.\nSection:\nMeasurements were made on two main platforms in the west Pacific. The FAAM BAe-146 research aircraft was based at the A. B. Won Pat International Airport, Guam (13.5°N, 144.8°E). The FAAM aircraft was collocated with the NCAR Gulfstream while the NASA Global Hawk was based at Andersen Air Force Base, approximately 30 km to the northeast. A suite of ground-based instrument systems was based at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) facility at Manus (2.1°S, 147.4°E), in order to characterize the tropospheric composition beyond the range of the FAAM aircraft.\nFlight planning.\nThe goal of the CAST FAAM flights was to characterize the inflow to convection in the lower troposphere in the west Pacific. To extend the range of the aircraft so that it could reach into the upwelling area near the equator, overnight stops were planned at the islands of Palau (Roman Tmetuchl International Airport, Babeldaob island, Republic of Palau; 7.4°N, 134.5°E) and Chuuk (Chuuk International Airport, Weno Island, Federated States of Micronesia; 7.5°N, 151.8°E). When conditions allowed, transects were made at 100 feet (30.5 m) [with occasional dips down to 50 ft (15.2 m)] over the open ocean to give the opportunity to sample air influenced by fresh ocean emissions. Stacked runs with horizontal legs at different altitudes were planned where possible to provide information about the vertical profile of the short-lived species in the lower troposphere. A large part of the flight planning for the FAAM research aircraft was to ensure good coverage of the lower troposphere within range from Guam.\nChemical forecast products were provided by the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) project in support of all three field campaigns. MACC assimilates comprehensive global observations of chemical composition into the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) meteorological forecasting system ( Flemming et al. 2015 ). The operational MACC system runs at 80-km horizontal resolution (T255) with 60 vertical levels. During the campaign, forecast plots for the operation domain were provided for a number of chemical species, including the FAAM measurements: O3, CO, CH4, black carbon, NO, and NO2. In addition, a number of hypothetical tracers were included to track air originating from different locations (e.g., regional emissions from China and India). A coastal emission tracer was used to track oceanic emissions of CHBr3 and other short-lived halocarbons since these are preferentially released in coastal regions ( Carpenter et al. 2009 ; Ashfold et al. 2014 ).\nLinking measurements.\nTo have near-real-time information about the air reaching the TTL from the lower troposphere, the trajectory-based approach of Ashfold et al. (2012) was adapted to meet the needs of a multiaircraft campaign. In this, the Numerical Atmospheric-Dispersion Modeling Environment (NAME) was run as an adjunct to the Met Office operational forecasting model so that it could access meteorological forecasts on a time scale quick enough to provide useful flight-planning information. The starting grid for the trajectories covered a large area of the west Pacific ( Fig. 7 ), with trajectories being released at altitudes between 8 and 18 km. Twelve-day backward trajectories were then calculated using a mixture of Met Office analyses and forecasts, so that information was available about the possible influence of lower-tropospheric air in the regions that could be sampled by the Global Hawk and the GV. Each day, trajectories were produced for 1, 2, 3 and 5 days into the future. In each 2-km-altitude layer, 5,000 particles were released in each 10° × 10° box. During the campaign, these calculations were made for a larger area at higher altitudes to reflect the larger range of the Global Hawk. The horizontal resolution of the Met Office operational model was 25 km in early 2014.\nAn example is shown in Fig. 1 for three altitude ranges (12–14, 14–16, and 16–18 km). Each point is the end point of each parcel of air that had crossed below 1 km in the preceding 12 days. For graphical clarity, only a fraction of the trajectories are shown at each level. Thus, strong, predicted low-level influence is indicated by a high percentage in each box (shown by the number), and at a given level by the denser clouds. These maps were routinely checked against flight plans for the Global Hawk and the GV to ensure that a wide range of low-level influences was sampled. In general, most flight plans met these criteria as a result of the proximity of the aircraft to the main convective region.\nView larger version (64K)\nFig. 1. Examples of trajectory-based forecast products used for multiaircraft flight planning. These plots are for 13 Feb 2014 when all three aircraft were in the same region [see Fig. 7 in Pan et al. (2016)]. The three panels show the location of air parcels which had been below 1-km altitude in the preceding 12 days at (a) 16–18, (b) 14–16, and (c) 12–14 km. The number in each box is the percentage of parcels in that box from below 1 km in the preceding 12 days. During the campaign, they were available as 1-, 3-, and 5-day forecasts for flight planning, and the NAME model was driven by analyses and forecasts from the Met Office operational model run at 25-km horizontal resolution.\nFAAM BAe-146 aircraft.\nThe FAAM BAe-146 has a science payload of up to 4 tons (∼3630 kg) devised according to the objectives of a particular campaign. The chemical composition of the tropical atmosphere is the focus of CAST and this dictated the scientific payload. The chemical species and physical parameters measured on the FAAM aircraft, along with the instruments used, are summarized in Table 1 . Trace gases with a wide range of atmospheric lifetimes, sources, and sinks were measured in order to provide information about the origin and fate of the air masses encountered, as well as about the atmospheric time scales involved. In many cases these species were also measured by the Global Hawk and/or the GV aircraft, giving good synergy between the three datasets. Understanding the distribution and chemistry of halogen species is a special focus for all three campaigns and this is reflected in the FAAM payload.\nTable 1. Instruments and measurements made by the BAe-146 (FAAM) aircraft during the CAST project. Also indicated are the synergy with other aircraft from the CONTRAST (GV) and ATTREX (Global Hawk) projects.\nTable 1.

Also indicated are the synergy with other aircraft from the CONTRAST (GV) and ATTREX (Global Hawk) projects.\nImage of typeset table\nWhole air samples (WASs) were collected as described in Andrews et al. (2013) . Analysis of WAS canisters was carried out in the aircraft hangar, usually within 72 h of collection. Two liters of sample air were preconcentrated using a thermal desorption unit (Markes Unity2 CIA-T) and analyzed with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS; Agilent 7890 GC, 5977 Xtr MSD). Halocarbons were quantified using a NOAA calibration gas standard. Dimethylsulfide was quantified using a secondary standard prepared and referenced to a primary [Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS)] standard. The full method is detailed in Andrews et al. (2013 , 2016) .\nMeasurements of a subset of halocarbons and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were made in flight using a new thermal desorption (TD) GC-MS system. A 1-L sample of air, drawn from a window blank inlet, pressurized to 2.5 atm (1 atm = 101,325 Pa), and dried using a multicore countercurrent nafion drier, was alternately preconcentrated or analyzed from two parallel adsorption traps (Tenax TA) of a two-channel TD system (Markes International, model TT 24/7). Analyses were refocused at the head of the column using liquid CO2 prior to separation (10 m, 180-μm inner diameter, 1-μm film, Restek RTX502.2 column; 40°–150°C at 40°C min−1) by GC (Agilent 6850) and detection by electron impact MS single-ion monitoring (Agilent 5975C), calibrated preflight against the WAS gas standard (NOAA, SX-3581). The instrument temporal resolution, and associated sample integration period, was 5 min.\nThe chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) from the Georgia Institute of Technology was configured similarly to previous deployments ( Le Breton et al. 2012 , 2013 ). The I− ionization scheme was used to detect inorganic halogens, carboxylic acids, HCN, and other trace species. For CAST, the CIMS made simultaneous measurements of BrO, BrCl, Br2, and HOBr. The 1-Hz data were averaged to 30 s for analysis. Precampaign and postflight laboratory calibrations were used relative to in-flight formic acid calibrations to quantify the sensitivities and limits of detection for the inorganic halogens, similar to that used for dinitrogen pentoxide ( Le Breton et al. 2014 ). The sensitivities ranged from 1 to 50 ion counts per part per trillion per second (ppt−1 s−1) determined by in-flight and postcampaign calibrations. The limits of detection for species varied from 0.36 to 37 ppt for 30-s-averaged data. (All mixing ratios given in this paper are by volume.) An acid scrubber was used to quantify the background signal in the instrument and inlet line.\nA broadband cavity-en-hanced absorption spectrometer (BBCEAS) was adapted to measure input/output (IO) in the 410–482-nm-wavelength region. No clear absorption feature was observable from spectra by eye with up to 100-s averaging, pointing to very low mixing ratios (<∼0.5 ppt) of IO over the sampled area. When using averaged data, a small positive bias (∼0.3 ppt) of IO was observed with respect to zero. These observations appear to support the existence of IO in the remote marine boundary layer at sub-ppt levels, but the limited sensitivity precludes robust identification of spatial gradients.\nNitrous oxide was measured using chemiluminescence and NO2 was quantified via a second channel, with NO2 being converted to NO using a blue-light LED converter centered at 395 nm. The NO2 mixing ratio is derived from the difference between the total NOx and NO mixing ratios. The instrument is calibrated via addition of 5 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) of known NO concentration to the ambient sample. The conversion efficiency of the LED converter is measured in each calibration using gas-phase titration of NO to NO2 on addition of O3. In-flight calibrations were conducted above the boundary layer to ensure stable low levels of NOx with before- and after-flight calibrations made using an overflow at the inlet of zero-grade air. A more detailed description of a similar system can be found in Lee et al. (2009) .\nThe level of O3 was measured by an ultraviolet (UV) absorption photometer (Thermo Fisher, model 49C), traceable to the U.K. National Physical Laboratory primary ozone standard with an uncertainty of 2% and a precision of 1 ppb for 4-s measurements.\nThe CO level was measured by a vacuum UV fluorescence analyzer [Aero Laser GmbH, model AL5002; Gerbig et al. (1999) ]. The instrument was calibrated in flight approximately every 45 min using a synthetic-air working standard (Air Liquide, ∼500 ppb), traceable to the NOAA/Earth System Research Laboratory [Global Monitoring Division-Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases Group (GMD-CCGG)] surveillance standard and the World Meteorological Organization CO-scale X2004. The 1-Hz CO measurements have a 2% uncertainty and 3-ppb precision.\nThe CO2 and CH4 levels were measured by a cavity-enhanced IR absorption spectrometer (Los Gatos Research, Inc., fast greenhouse gas analyzer, model RMT-200). The instrument was customized for airborne operations ( O’Shea et al. 2013 ), so CO2 and CH4 dry mole fractions can be linearized in flight using natural-air working standards, traceable to the World Meteorological Organization CO2-scale X2007 and CH4-scale X2004. The performance of the system is estimated from one standard deviation of all in-flight “target” calibration data. The 1-Hz measurement precisions are estimated at 0.7 ppm and 2.5 ppb for CO2 and CH4, respectively. Through the addition of all known uncertainties, we estimate a total accuracy of ±1.3 ppb for CH4 and ±0.2 ppm for CO2.\nThe Passive Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer Probe 100-X (PCASP), upgraded with the SPP-200 electronics package from Droplet Measurement Technologies (DMT), measures aerosol particles with nominal diameters of 0.1–3 µm. Light from a 0.6328-µm laser is scattered by the particles and a photodetector sums the forward (over solid angles subtended by 35°–120°) and backward (60°–145°) scattered light. The probe is canister mounted under the wing and was operated at 1 Hz. The instrument was calibrated for particle size before and after the campaign. Uncertainties exist in both the sizing and the counting of particles and these are discussed, along with the calibration procedure, in Rosenberg et al. (2012) .\nThe DMT Cloud Droplet Probe (CDP; Lance et al. 2010 ) was flown on the same under-wing pylon as the PCASP. The CDP is an open-path instrument that measures the forward-scattered light (over solid angles nominally subtended by 1.7°–14°) from the 0.658-µm incident laser beam. Particles are assigned to 1 of 30 size bins over the nominal size range 3–50 µm. Calibration with certified diameter glass beads was carried out before each flight ( Rosenberg et al. 2012 ). The sample rate of the CDP was the same as for the PCASP, 1 Hz.\nManus.\nObservations started at the ARM climate facility on Manus during October 1996 ( Mather et al. 1998 ) and continued until August 2014. These observations provided the basis for many studies of the climate in the west Pacific (e.g., Long et al. 2013 and references therein). In February 2014, a suite of ground-based instruments was deployed as part of CAST to make measurements of ozone (ground and profile), short-lived halocarbons, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane. The instruments used are now described and are also summarized in Table 2 .\nTable 2. Measurements made at the ARM site at Manus during CAST. Information about the meteorological measurements from Manus can be found online ( www.arm.gov/sites/twp/C1/instruments ).\nTable 2. Measurements made at the ARM site at Manus during CAST. Information about the meteorological measurements from Manus can be found online ( www.arm.gov/sites/twp/C1/instruments ).\nImage of typeset table\nOzone profiles were measured using ozonesondes. Air is pumped through a potassium–iodine (KI) solution in a cathode half-cell, with two electrons produced for each ozone molecule; the cell current is directly proportional to the flow of ozone through the cell. Ozonesondes have a typical response time of about 1 min at the tropopause level, with a precision of a few parts per billion. In the TTL the accuracy of the measurement is dominated by the background current ( Newton et al. 2016 and references therein). Simultaneously, vertical profiles of temperature, humidity, wind, and pressure were measured with Vaisala RS92 radiosondes.\nGround-level ozone was measured by a Thermo-Electric Corporation TE49C, which is a dual-channel ultraviolet photometer measuring ozone through absorption of radiation at 254 nm. The incoming airstream is split between two identical cells, with a scrubber removing ozone from one of the streams. The TE49C provides a measurement every 10 s and has a 20-s response time.\nGround-level trace-gas concentrations were measured by a Picarro Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer G2401 (CRDS; Crosson 2008 ). The sample air inlet was at about 8 m above ground level with a rain cover and a 2-µm particulate filter. Water vapor in the instrument was kept below 1.5 ppm and was controlled by passing the sample flow (∼250 mL min−1) through a chiller at approximately 5°C and then through a desiccant-based nafion drier. CO2 and CH4 concentrations were recorded every 5 s, with precisions of ∼1 and ∼200 ppb, respectively. Calibrations were achieved using a target gas (CH4, 2024 ppb; CO2, 390 ppm) measured every 2 days for 10 min with low and high calibration runs on intermediate days [low (high): CH4, 1919 (2736) ppb; CO2, 360 (495) ppm]. The calibration gases are linked to the NOAA–WMO calibration scale.\nSurface concentrations of short-lived halocarbons were measured using a µDirac instrument, a gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD) based on an instrument described in Gostlow et al. (2010) but with a 10-m separation column. The instrument sampled ambient air from the roughly 8-m-high mast, with a 10–20 mL min–1 flow dried using a counterflow nafion drier. Calibration runs, using a NOAA/ESRL air cylinder spiked with the target compounds, were conducted regularly (every three samples). The calibration volumes ranged from 3 to 50 mL to allow correction for drifts in instrument sensitivity and linearity. Measurement precision is species dependent, typically 2%–10% (plus or minus one standard deviation), with accuracy in the range of 5%–10% (plus or minus one standard deviation).\nOVERVIEW OF MEASUREMENTS.\nSection:\nThe FAAM BAe-146 made a total of 25 science flights totaling 90 flight hours during the CAST deployment in the west Pacific ( Fig. 2 ). Brief summaries of the flights are given in Table 3 . The flight tracks are shown in Fig. 2 , with the altitude represented by the color of the line. The large majority of the flights were below 5-km altitude, with a significant fraction in the marine boundary layer (below about 1 km), with good coverage between 2°S and 14°N and 130° and 160°E.\nView larger version (78K)\nFig. 2. Map of FAAM BAe-146 flight tracks during Jan–Feb 2014. The flight tracks are colored by altitude. The islands of Guam, Palau, and Chuuk are marked. The background shows Jan–Feb-averaged Chl-a concentrations in 2014, measured by the MODIS satellite [NASA Giovanni: Acker and Leptoukh (2007) ]. The inset shows an enlarged area around Chuuk atoll.\nTable 3. Research flights made by the BAe-146 (FAAM) aircraft during the CAST project.\nTable 3. Research flights made by the BAe-146 (FAAM) aircraft during the CAST project.\nImage of typeset table\nThe vertical distribution of the science flights can also be seen in Fig. 3 , which shows O3 and CO concentrations as a function of altitude and latitude. In general, lower O3 values are found in the marine boundary layer and at lower latitudes, while high values are found at higher altitudes and at higher latitudes. There is no obvious correlation with CO. However, when the O3 and CO data are plotted against each other ( Fig. 4 ), a bimodal relationship emerges. Further, the lower ozone values (10–40 ppb) occur when the relative humidity is high ( Fig. 4 , top). This finding reinforces that of Pan et al. (2015) , who report this bimodality throughout the altitude range covered by the NCAR GV, with a background mode of nearly constant (∼20 ppb) values throughout the troposphere and a secondary mode of higher ozone (∼35–95 ppb) in layers with lower relative humidity. The previously reported S-shaped mean profile ( Folkins et al. 2002 ) results from averaging the two modes.\nView larger version (44K)\nFig. 3. (top left) Ozone and (top right) carbon monoxide mixing ratios measured during all CAST flights as a function of latitude and altitude. (right) The means and associated two standard deviations of ozone and carbon monoxide are shown as a function of altitude. See text and Table 1 for instrumental details.\nView larger version (44K)\nFig. 4. Plots of O3 against CO colored by (bottom) NO and (top) relative humidity (10-s-averaged data).\nThe CAST measurements ( Fig. 4 ) show that high ozone and lower relative humidity often occurs with higher NO concentrations and does not occur with low CO concentrations. Preliminary analysis of the high NO measurements indicates that the air masses encountered had previously been in regions close to anthropogenic activities and/or biomass burning. For example, the MACC forecasts show the transport of biomass burning and Southeast Asian tracers to the west Pacific. The possible role of biomass burning has been thoroughly investigated by Anderson et al. (2016) using CAST and CONTRAST measurements. The presence of HCN, CH3CN, and other tracers in the high-ozone levels is explained by biomass-burning plumes, which are convectively lofted into the free troposphere undergoing dehydration during the convection. As this air descends, its relative humidity drops and ozone is produced photochemically.\nThe CHBr3 concentrations measured with the Whole Air Sampler and the onboard GC-MS are shown in Fig. 5 . In general the values are low, with even the higher values not far above the background values seen in this region ( Brinckmann et al. 2012 ). The lower amounts of CHBr3 were encountered out of the boundary layer ( Fig. 4b ). The background in Fig. 2 shows that the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in the surface waters of the west Pacific were low during this period. Higher Chl-a values are seen in the shallower waters approaching the islands of the Maritime Continent. The lagoon inside Chuuk atoll is relatively shallow (<60 m) and is embedded in much deeper ocean waters. It has a circumference of about 200 km and an area of about 3000 km2. If halocarbons are emitted preferentially in shallow waters ( Carpenter et al. 2009 ), then it should be discernible as an emission hotspot. The influence of short-lived halocarbon emissions from shallower waters was investigated during the FAAM flights by circling Chuuk atoll at low altitudes. The inset in Fig. 5a shows the CHBr3 observed on these flights as well as the instantaneous wind speed observed by the FAAM aircraft. Higher concentrations of CHBr3 (red) are found when air has previously passed over the atoll, indicating that the atoll is a source of CHBr3.\nView larger version (44K)\nFig. 5. CHBr3 mixing ratios (colors) sampled by the FAAM aircraft during CAST using the whole air sampler (squares) and the onboard GC-MS (circles). (a) All measurements made at altitudes less than 1 km. The enlarged inset shows the values around the Chuuk atoll. The lines associated with each measurement in the inset indicate the instantaneous wind speed measured by the aircraft. (b) The measurements at altitudes greater than 1 km. The inset shows the vertical profile of all measurements.\nThe NAME model driven by Met Office analyzed fields has been used to interpret the CHBr3 and other brominated VSLS measurements made near the tropopause on the Global Hawk in the east Pacific during 2013 and the west Pacific during 2014 ( Navarro et al. 2015 ). The approach is similar to the forecast information produced during the campaign (see above). They find that the majority of air recently injected into the TTL had come from the west Pacific in both years with similar amounts, approximately 6 (4–9) ppt, of combined organic and inorganic bromine derived from brominated VSLS.\nAt the ARM facility in Manus, CHBr3 was also observed ( Fig. 5 ). The median value in this period was 0.81 ppt, about half that previously observed at a coastal site in Malaysian Borneo ( Robinson et al. 2014 ) and similar to the values observed on the FAAM aircraft ( Fig. 4 ). A strong diurnal cycle is seen in early February in several trace gases measured at Manus with increased nocturnal amounts, providing evidence for local nighttime sources of CO2, CH4, CHBr3, and CH3I. This diurnal pattern of behavior was seen from 3 to 12 February when the winds were low and a stable boundary layer was able to form. Before and after this period winds were higher and the nighttime buildup was much less.\nTogether, the CHBr3 observations appear to be consistent with past work focused on Southeast Asia. Elevated levels are frequently observed close to coasts (e.g., Pyle et al. 2011 ) or above shallow waters, but measurements collected a relatively small distance away (less than a typical global model grid cell) rarely contain above-background levels of CHBr3. This suggests that coasts are not a large source in a regional/global sense (as found by Ashfold et al. 2014 ), and for coastal CHBr3 emissions to contribute significantly to the TTL and stratosphere would require collocation of convection ( Russo et al. 2015 ).\nGround-based ozone at Manus showed decreases at night in the quiescent period from a peak daytime value of 10 to <5-ppb levels which is consistent with oxidative uptake to the local vegetation ( Fig. 6 ). This is the only time such low values of ozone were seen in CAST. In the absence of local sources, C2Cl4 is a good tracer of large-scale transport, and its concentrations during this period were generally in the range 1–1.5 ppt, which is typical of results seen in the clean west Pacific ( Ashfold et al. 2015 ). Manus was mainly influenced by flow from the north throughout this period.\nView larger version (103K)\nFig. 6. Surface observations of (top to bottom) wind, O3, CO2, CH4, C2Cl4, CHBr3, and CH3I at the ARM facility on Manus from 1 to 24 Feb 2014. The time shown along the x axis is universal time. The shading indicates the local time, with the darker bands representing nighttime.\nA total of 39 ozonesondes were launched from Manus in February 2014, with 34 sondes providing good ozone profiles ( Fig. 7a ; Newton et al. 2016 ). These measurements are most difficult in the tropics as the ozone concentrations are low, so that any error in estimating the background current is important. Particular attention was therefore paid to measurements of the background current, leading to recommendations for changes to the standard operation procedures used in the sonde preparation. Support for this approach is provided by good agreement in a coordinated ozonesonde–GV flight (see Fig. 14 in Pan et al. 2017 ). The ozone measurements are shown in Fig. 7 alongside the corresponding MACC 1- and 4-day forecasts. The forecasts predicted the main characteristics of the observations such as increased ozone at about 400 hPa from 14 to 16 February and the low concentrations near the TTL from 19 to 23 February. The minimum reproducible ozone concentration measured in the TTL was 12 ppb, consistent with the minimum of 13 ppb measured by the GV during CONTRAST ( Pan et al. 2017 ).\nFig. 7. (left) Daily observed ozone profile in Manus and corresponding MACC forecasts with lead times of (center) 1 and (right) 4 days.\nNew technology developments.\nAs part of the collaboration with ATTREX, three new developments were included in CAST: two instruments for use on the Global Hawk, the Aerosol–Ice–Interface Transition Spectrometer (AIITS) and the Greenhouse Gas Observations in the Stratosphere and Troposphere (GHOST), along with a software tool, Real-Time Atmospheric Science Cluster Analysis (RASCAL), designed to assist aircraft scientists by performing real-time data analysis during flights. The two new instruments were flown for a total of 40 h during one test flight and two science flights in February–March 2015 from the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center, Edwards Air Force Base, California. They were part of a payload that also included Hawkeye, the NOAA H2O and O3 instruments, the Global Hawk Whole Air Sampler (GWAS), and the Microwave Temperature Profiler (MTP) (see Jensen et al. 2017 for more details).\nAIITS was designed to probe different cirrus regimes in the TTL in order to understand fundamental nucleation and sublimation processes influencing the stratospheric water budget and fluxes, as well as the potential impact of biomass burning on cirrus ice crystal activation and growth. It is the next instrument in the Small Ice Detector (SID) family ( Hirst et al. 2001 ; Kaye et al. 2008 ). AIITS acquires 2D forward-scattering patterns from particles in the size range from about one to a few hundred micrometers and can measure the depolarization in backward and forward scattering. The patterns allow quantification of the phase, habit, and fine surface features of large aerosol and small ice crystals in the size range 2–100 µm ( Cotton et al. 2010 ; Ulanowski et al. 2014 ). Unique results were obtained by AIITS during cirrus penetrations at 16.5 km and at temperatures down to -80°C ( Fig. 8 ). These revealed a transition to smooth quasi-spherical ice particle regimes in specific regions of TTL layers in response to changing supersaturation regimes. The impact on the radiative scattering properties of cirrus in these regimes is being investigated.\nView larger version (60K)\nFig. 8. AIITS scattering patterns recorded from ice particles in the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS), at altitudes of about 16 km and temperatures of about –80°C. The pictures are indicative of (left) a smooth quasi-spherical ice particle, (center) a columnar crystal, and (right) a pristine hexagonal plate.\nGHOST is a novel grating spectrometer designed for remote sensing of greenhouse gases from aircraft ( Humpage et al. 2014 ). It measures spectrally resolved shortwave-infrared radiance across four spectral bands from 1.27 to 2.3 µm, with a spectral resolution between 0.1 and 0.3 nm. An optical gimbal underneath the aircraft is programmed to pass solar radiation reflected from the ocean surface through a fiber optic bundle into the spectrometer with a single grating and detector for all four bands. The bands are chosen to include absorption bands for CO2 and CH4 as well as CO, H2O, and O2; O2 is used to infer information on the scattering contributions toward the measured light. The third Global Hawk flight of the CAST/ATTREX campaign targeted the overpasses of two greenhouse gas observing satellites during clear-sky conditions over the eastern Pacific ( Fig. 9 ): the NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Greenhouse Gas Observing Satellite (GOSAT). This Global Hawk flight therefore provides a very useful validation dataset for these satellites, since they both make greenhouse gas measurements using a spectral range similar to that of GHOST.\nView larger version (87K)\nFig. 9. Flight path of the NASA Global Hawk on 10 Mar 2015 (blue). The OCO-2 (green) and GOSAT (red) soundings are shown and coincide temporally with the flight leg between 25°N, 127°W and 18°N, 125°W. MODIS cloud fraction data (see gray scale bar; Platnick et al. 2015 ) coincident with the OCO-2 overpass at 2140 UTC shows the largely cloud-free conditions encountered during this leg of the flight.\nAs real-time data becomes increasingly available, mission scientists are faced with a potentially overwhelming data torrent, from which they are required to find the information on which to base decisions. At present, mission scientists often focus on a subset of the data stream, limiting the depth of the analysis that can be carried out. As part of CAST, a new software framework, RASCAL, has been developed based on recent developments in arbitrarily shaped cluster detection algorithms ( Hyde and Angelov 2015 ). It interfaces intuitively with mission scientist expert knowledge and provides real-time on-the-fly cluster and anomaly detection (i.e., for real-time diagnosis of structures such as those presented in Fig. 4 , for example, but tested simultaneously across many chemical “dimensions”). The data stream can be separated in real time, without a priori assumptions about parameter relationships, to reveal different data groups and hence isolate specific regions of interest that can be revisited virtually postflight. In combination with the expert knowledge of the mission scientists, support tools like RASCAL have the potential to be used on many research aircraft, potentially adding significant value to the results achieved in field measurement campaigns.\nSUMMARY.\nSection:\nBased in Guam as part of a joint deployment with the NASA ATTREX Global Hawk and the NSF CONTRAST GV, the FAAM research aircraft deployment during CAST has provided an excellent characterization of the lower-tropospheric atmospheric composition in the tropical warm pool region. The majority of the FAAM aircraft flights were below 5-km altitude, and a significant fraction was in the marine boundary layer with good coverage from 2°S to 14°N and from 130° to 160°E. A suite of organic and inorganic halogen compounds was measured, with the bromine-containing species being particularly well covered.\nGround-based measurements were made at the ARM facility on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, during February 2014. These measurements characterize the tropospheric composition just south of the equator in a region inaccessible to the FAAM aircraft in this deployment. The Manus ozonesonde measurements are a valuable resource, providing a good picture of the vertical distribution of ozone in the tropical warm pool region during February with a minimum ozone concentration in the TTL of 12 ppb.\nThese measurements are being interpreted by CAST scientists in conjunction with measurements from ATTREX and CONTRAST using a range of modeling and data analysis approaches. The CAST data are stored at the British Atmospheric Data Centre ( http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/ ), and interested parties are encouraged to use them for their own studies. All users are strongly encouraged to involve the responsible instrument scientists in these studies in order to gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of these data.\nNever before has the atmosphere over the west Pacific been observed in such detail, particularly the chemical composition, with three aircraft covering all altitudes from 0 to 20 km. New insights are starting to emerge with a much improved understanding of the tropical ozone distribution ( Pan et al. 2015 ; Anderson et al. 2016 ; Newton et al. 2016 ). These findings will be underpinned by advances in the understanding of halogen distribution ( Navarro et al. 2015 ) and chemistry building on the new tropospheric halogen measurements and modeling ( Sherwen et al. 2016 ). Such research will lead to a much greater quantitative understanding of the role of a) VSLS reaching the stratosphere and b) how halogen chemistry affects tropospheric ozone over the tropical oceans. Similar advances can be expected with respect to transport and dynamics, the role of cirrus clouds in climate, and dehydration of the stratosphere. The benefits of this unique, coordinated campaign are just starting to become clear.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nCAST is funded by NERC and STFC, with Grants NE/ I030054/1 (lead award), NE/J006262/1, NE/J006238/1, NE/J006181/1, NE/J006211/1, NE/J006061/1, NE/J006157/1, NE/J006203/1, NE/J00619X/1, and NE/J006173/1.

"""Cranfield_University""","""Women in Ground Close Combat: The RUSI Journal: Vol 161, No 1""","""Women in Ground Close Combat\nPDF\nAbstract\nAs the global momentum towards the acceptance of women in ground close combat (GCC) continues to grow, the US decided in December 2015 to open all GCC roles to women without exception – a controversial and, some say, politically motivated decision. The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) is under political pressure to accept women in GCC, but has indicated it will give proper consideration to the Big Data generated by the numerically more significant US experience. In this article, Fitriani, Randolf G S Cooper and Ron Matthews argue that the MoD’s quest for more data is part of a sincere effort to place the debate squarely within the realm of investigative research rather than gender theory. They contextualise the MoD’s decision while establishing a framework to demonstrate that denying GCC roles to British women would be seen as running counter to international trends.\nThe Celtic warrior queen Boudicca, often portrayed as Britain’s first female warrior, led the uprising against the Roman Empire, circa 60 AD. There is, however, a surprising absence of reliable data as to the true nature of her military deeds or any claim to precedent. 1 1  Carolyn Williams, Boudica and Her Stories: Narrative Transformations of a Warrior Queen (Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Presses, 2009), p. 23; Stephanie Lawson, ‘Nationalism and Biographical Transformation: The Case of Boudicca’, Humanities Research (Vol. 19, No. 1, 2013). View all notes The mystique of the ‘woman warrior’ – symbolised by Boudicca as a cultural icon – can be traced through Queen Elizabeth I, at war with Spain, to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and Britain’s victory in the Falklands. British attitudes towards the role of women in ground close combat (GCC) have changed slowly in the past 2,000 years, coming full circle more than once – being more open to the idea in the Early as opposed to Late Medieval period, for example. References to women warriors in hand-to-hand combat were common in the tenth to thirteenth centuries, but became scarce in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. 2 2  Megan McLaughlin, ‘The Woman Warrior: Gender, Warfare and Society in Medieval Europe’, Women’s Studies (Vol. 17, No. 1, 1990), pp. 193–209. View all notes This was likely due to changes in the nature of warfare: combatants, including women, in the earlier period tended to represent family or clan-oriented units, whilst the latter period witnessed a rise of mercenary armies in which women played no role. 3 3 Ibid., p. 205. View all notes Here began the evolution towards the binary imagery of men as the brave, ‘just warriors’ and women as the gentle, ‘beautiful souls’. 4 4  Jean Bethke Elshtain, Women and War, 2nd edition (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1987), pp. 3–10. View all notes\nRemarkably, British women were not allowed to enter into full military service until the 1950s, some time after the end of the Second World War. Only then were the members of the Women’s Royal Army Corps finally recognised as having similar military rank as their male counterparts, and only then were they able to bear arms. 5 5  Lucy Noakes, Women in the British Army: War and the Gentle Sex, 1907–1948 (New York, NY: Routledge, 2006), p. 148.

View all notes In 1990, British women were allowed to serve in Royal Navy ships and the following year they deployed to serve in the First Gulf War. 7 7 Ibid. View all notes A 1998 Manning Report on fairer employment led to the British military opening up 1,300 jobs for women (widening accessible jobs from 47 per cent to 70 per cent of roles available), an anti-harassment policy was introduced and women were no longer required to leave the forces upon becoming pregnant. 8 8  Helena Carreiras, Gender and the Military: Women in the Armed Forces of Western Democracies (Oxford: Routledge, 2006), p. 108, Louisa Brooke-Holland, ‘Women in Combat: a Bibliography’, SN06886, House of Common Library, May 2014, p. 3; Imran Khadim, ‘UK Armed Forces Annual Manning Report: Analysis by Rank and Age at 1 April 2011’, Defence Analytical Services and Advice, Ministry of Defence (MoD), May 2011, pp. 3–6. View all notes However, the 1998 report kept in place the ban on women’s access to front-line combat roles in the RAF Regiment, the infantry, the Royal Armoured Corps and the Royal Marines, despite women serving in warships and fighter aircraft. The report acknowledged that only a small number of women are capable of reaching the required level of physical fitness, and hence blanket admission to combat services could not be justified. 9 9  Employment of Women in the Armed Forces Steering Group, Women in the Armed Forces (London: MoD, 2002), p. 51.

View all notes At the heart of the gender debate, however, is whether women should be allowed to assume GCC roles. The UK’s armed forces are committed to gender equality, but should this extend to engaging enemy forces at close quarters (and potentially killing them) in hand-to-hand combat? The Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) treatment of this issue will also inevitably have implications for the perception and construction of gender roles and identities.\nWomen in Ground Close Combat\nAll authors\nPublished online:\n11 March 2016\nA US Navy corpsman waits for her female colleagues in the Engagement Team, Afghanistan, August 2010.

Image courtesy of US Navy.\nThe MoD’s position is that it has a duty of care to protect servicewomen – specifically, to ensure that they suffer no long-term negative physiological impact from carrying extremely heavy loads, exacerbated by the physical differences between men and women in terms of hip configuration and bone-muscle density. In general, women have smaller hearts, about 30 per cent less muscle, a slighter skeletal structure and wider pelvic bones, resulting in less-explosive power and upper-body strength. 12 12  MoD, ‘Women in Ground Close Combat (GCC) Review Paper’, p. 3. View all notes The UK Equality Act 2010 allows the exclusion of women from GCC provided it is proportionate to ensuring combat effectiveness. This approach is supported by European law, but with the caveat that the legislation be reviewed every eight years. 13 13 Ibid., p. 1. View all notes Such reviews offer the opportunity for change if contextual considerations evolve, as is now the case. Across the globe, there is growing pressure for equality in armed forces. Women have already proven themselves in military roles that until now were deemed less demanding than GCC; indeed, they now serve in the intelligence corps, as medics integrated into infantry patrols, as pilots of Apache helicopters and fighter aircraft, and in submarines and warships. Presently, seventeen states permit women to serve in combat units. In addition, France, Israel and the Netherlands already allow partial participation in front-line roles, meaning that women can serve in most front-line posts save, for instance, in submarines the (Netherlands) and tanks (Israel), due to the close operating quarters Australia is also phasing women into the front line, and the US and Brazil are reviewing their policies on gender and combat. 14 14  Max Fisher, ‘Map: Which Countries Allow Women in Front-Line Combat Roles?’, Washington Post, 25 January 2013; Emma Barnett, ‘Meet the Female Soldiers Proving the Case for Women on the Front Line’, Daily Telegraph, 8 October 2013; Janene Pieters, ‘Women to Serve on Dutch Submarines’, NL Times, 11 May 2015; Mitch Ginsburg, ‘Army Makes U-turn on Letting Women Serve in Tanks’, Times of Israel, 19 May 2015. View all notes\nThe UK MoD has held a watching brief, but in light of the international momentum for change, it has responded by intensifying and quickening the pace of assessment. The MoD’s review process began in 2002 and was followed by a further review in 2010. 15 15  Employment of Women in the Armed Forces Steering Group, Women in the Armed Forces; MoD, ‘Report on the Review of the Exclusion of Women from Ground Close-Combat Roles’, November 2010. View all notes The principal thrust of the two studies was to consider the effect of mixed-gender teams on cohesion and combat effectiveness. The reviews concluded that the risks do not warrant inclusion of women in GCC operations. Yet, in numerous subtle ways, the most recent December 2014 review, entitled ‘Women in Ground Close Combat (GCC) Review Paper’, represents a tangible step towards the long-debated final decision on whether to open combat-arms posts to women in the UK armed forces.\nThe 2014 review recognises that GCC is ‘an intense, visceral and unavoidably physical activity’, where ‘[v]iolent death, injury, all-pervading concussive noise, horror, fear, blood and high levels of emotion are common themes’. 16 16  Hugh McManners, The Scars of War (London: HarperCollins, 1993); MoD, ‘Women in Ground Close Combat (GCC) Review Paper’, p. 2. View all notes This in turn raises the question of whether this extremely brutal environment is a place where women can serve effectively, without undermining overall combat effectiveness. To research the issue, the MoD established nine work strands and determined twenty-one factors that would influence the final decision. Two work strands, physiology and cohesion, were held to weigh most heavily among the contributory influences, with others covering a broader spectrum of considerations. These included the roles of women in recent operations, the views of armed-forces personnel and wider society, the experiences of other states, and the practicality, risks and costs of changing current policy (incorporating the costs of a cultural-change strategy along with an estimated high-end £20 million implementation cost over a ten-year period). 17 17  MoD, ‘Women in Ground Close Combat (GCC) Review Paper’, p. 5, para. 21, subsection (c). View all notes The review’s findings indicate that of the twenty-one factors that contribute to combat effectiveness, only one would be improved by the inclusion of women, seven would see no impact, eleven would be negatively affected and the impact on the remaining two is too difficult to assess. 18 18 Ibid., p. 3, para. 27. View all notes Three of the seven negative factors fall into the physiology domain, namely survivability, morbidity and deployability, 19 19  Survivability is the combined effects of the impact of human and external factors on the likelihood of an individual becoming a casualty during combat. Morbidity is the incidence of disease or injury in a cohort of the population. Deployability is the ability to be deployed on operation, sometimes on foot over difficult terrain, carrying substantial weight, to engage in close-quarter fighting. See ibid., pp. 2, 4, C-5.

View all notes Data on whether mixed-gender teams undermine cohesion are inconclusive, and thus the 2014 review apparently takes the view that it should not be considered in further research, except where physiological differences have an impact on cohesion and thus on combat effectiveness. 21 21 Ibid., p. 5. View all notes\nThree possible courses of action were set out by the 2014 review: first, lift the exclusion immediately; second, retain it; or third, commit to further research. 22 22 Ibid., p. 7, para. 26. View all notes When launching the review, the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, spoke approvingly of the third option, suggesting that extensive studies and physiological testing would be undertaken before a final decision is made in mid-2016. Previous UK-based testing by the Infantry Battle School and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory probed the linkage between combat effectiveness and load carriage, lethality and survivability. A key finding was that reduced lethality due to degradation of combat marksmanship results from fatigue, which occurs when combat load increases in proportion to body weight and strength. 23 23 Ibid., p. 4, para 18, subsection (c). View all notes It seems that new and supplementary testing is required, however, to generate a more representative data set and to consider if there are ways in which physical training can be optimised for women, including whether factors influencing morbidity might be mitigated. 24 24 Ibid., p. 6, para 22, subsection (b). View all notes The review nevertheless acknowledges that the need for further testing might be construed as a delaying action and that a ‘chance remains that there may be insufficient certainty by 2016 [if] research fails to deliver new definitive data’. 25 25 Ibid., p. 7, para 26, subsection (b).

The First Gulf War and the engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan all depended heavily on American women in uniform. Between September 2001 and May 2013, some 2,333,972 US military personnel, 10 per cent of whom were servicewomen, rotated through these theatres of war. 26 26  Robert L Maginnis, Deadly Consequences: How Cowards are Pushing Women into Combat (Washington, DC: Regnery Publishing, 2013), p. 150.

By way of a comparison, nine British servicewomen were killed in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. See Jack Sommers, ‘British Army Ex-Commander Says Women Dont [sic] Have “Warrior Ethos” to Serve On Frontline’, Huffington Post, 19 November 2014. View all notes Their deaths were due to chance encounters with the enemy, and as a direct result of improvised explosive devices while on support missions. 28 28  Maginnis, Deadly Consequences, p. 150. View all notes These deployments generated a much larger data set, accelerated the national debate over women in combat and compelled the US military to initiate in-depth testing that underpins a robust debate. 29 29  The MoD has already incorporated relevant US data on such issues as female injuries related to load carriage, morbidity on deployment, diet, infertility and post-traumatic stress disorder. Ibid., Annex B, pp. B2–B4, paras. 11, 25, 27–29. View all notes\nThe US has generated broader and deeper data sets on the role of women in GCC simply because it has deployed more women into combat zones. In part, this has engendered a longer and more rancorous societal debate concerning women on the front line. The end of the draft in the 1970s led to difficulty in recruiting sufficient numbers of qualified men for military service, and that coincided with the gains in female volunteer recruiting. There were two reasons for the decline in qualified male recruits: the decline in birth rate during the 1960s; and broad disillusionment with the military caused by the US’s performance in the Vietnam War. 30 30  Ellen C Collier, ‘Women in the Armed Forces’, CRS Issue Brief, IB79045, Congressional Research Service, November 1991, pp. 3–4. View all notes By 1976, however, there was a new dynamic at work in the form of increased pressure to open the upper ranks to women, and that year women were admitted for the first time to the three major service academies. 31 31  Bettie J Morden, The Women’s Army Corps, 1945–1978 (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1990), pp. 321–22. View all notes Although the latter event was far from a watershed moment, women’s admission to male bastions such as West Point had a polarising effect, energising those seeking to shatter the military’s glass ceiling. The glacial progress within the military during the 1960s and 1970s was highlighted by the more dynamic achievements gained by the feminist movement in Western society and in the US in particular.\nThe US debate over the role of women in combat continues today. A substantial body of literature has been accumulated arguing against women assuming combat roles, primarily, but not exclusively, because of their perceived inability to handle the physical or emotional trauma of war. 32 32  Marie E deYoung, ‘A Feminist Analysis in Support of the U.S. Army Ground Combat Exclusion for Women’, in Lorry M Fenner and Marie E deYoung (eds), Women in Combat: Civic Duty or Military Liability? (Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 2001) pp. 107–67. View all notes This position has been lent contemporary support by Lieutenant Colonel Robert L Maginnis’s contentious 2013 book, Deadly Consequences: How Cowards are Pushing Women into Combat. The author sees the US armed forces as led by ‘senior flag and general officers who … have an uncanny sense of which way the political winds are blowing and immediately correct their heading accordingly, while ignoring the consequences for operational readiness, the mission, and the safety and morale of [the] troops’. 33 33  Maginnis, Deadly Consequences, p. 5. View all notes Alongside his pillorying of senior officers, Maginnis also levels stinging criticism at the legislative branch of government for not reining in what he sees as a defence establishment bowing to pressure groups: ‘Congress is derelict in its duty to establish laws and policies that govern the military. It is kowtowing to radical feminists and accepting the mass media’s illogical formulation of the issue as one of “equal rights”’. 34 34 Ibid., p. ix. View all notes\nOne of Maginnis’s sources is US Marine Corps (USMC) Captain Katie Petronio, a fully qualified combat engineer, with five years’ active service, and a veteran of deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Petronio participated in and led combat operations in the Upper Sangin Valley. In addition, she served as a subject-matter expert advising regimental and battalion commanders on the integration of women into combat-operations teams and expanding the Iraq-based Team Lioness programme from female body searches to engaging locals in dialogue, to direct utilisation in combat raids. In a controversial article for the Marine Corps Gazette, Petronio challenged the motivation and identity of those pushing an apparently political agenda, pointing out that the issue is not being addressed through Congress, an elected and public forum, but rather is being treated as an in-house matter by the US Department of Defense. She questions who is driving this agenda, proclaiming: ‘I am not personally hearing female Marines, enlisted or officers, pounding on the doors of Congress claiming that their inability to serve in the infantry violates their right to equality’. 35 35  Katie Petronio, ‘Get Over It! We are Not All Created Equal’, Marine Corps Gazette (Vol. 93, No. 3, March 2013). Significantly, an internal poll (10,943 responses) of members of the British armed forces on whether women should serve in GCC roles found 54 per cent against, 34 per cent for, and 12 per cent unsure, though the respondents were not solely female. See MoD, ‘Women in Ground Close Combat (GCC) Review Paper’, p. 3. View all notes Petronio argues that despite her excellent physical condition when entering the USMC, symbolised by her ability to bench-press 145 pounds, the gruelling field deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan had taken a physical toll. After a seven-month deployment in Afghanistan and the construction of eighteen patrol bases, she admitted ‘I [have] lost 17 pounds and was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (which personally resulted in infertility, but is not a genetic trend in my family), which was brought on by the chemical and physical changes endured during deployment’. Petronio contends, based on her own experiences, that women suffer faster physical deterioration in comparison with male colleagues and, consequently, if women are included in combat roles there would be a ‘colossal increase in crippling and career-ending medical conditions for females’. 36 36  Petronio, ‘Get Over It!’. The counterpoint to Petronio’s argument is that whilst we are not all created equal, not all men are strong and not all women are weak. Surely, the main point is that military standards should be open for all personnel to apply, irrespective of gender, so that the best women and men can serve. Gayle Tzemach Lemmon’s latest book depicts the story of US 1st Lieutenant Ashley White, who was killed in Afghanistan, along with two Rangers, by an improvised-explosive-device blast. White and other women were in a ‘Cultural Support Team’, deployed alongside special-operations forces. The women’s job was to act as ‘enablers’, to talk to local women, constrained by the nature of Afghanistan’s sex-segregated communities. Servicewomen would join nightly direct-action raids to apprehend terrorists and insurgents in the hope that one day they would be allowed to join the Rangers’ strike force (p. 14). However, the incident that took White’s life happened at a time when women were banned from ground combat, thereby making her death seem somehow less heroic compared to her two colleagues’. See Gayle Tzemach Lemmon, Ashley’s War: The Untold Story of a Team of Women Soldiers on the Special Ops Battlefield (New York, NY: HarperCollins, 2015). View all notes For this reason, she sees the paucity of health-related test data as a real obstacle to sensible decision-making.\nThere is now, at least, a movement within the US armed forces to gain a greater empirical understanding of the effects of women performing GCC roles, albeit with a focus on operational effectiveness – something which the MoD has acknowledged will ‘contribute to UK decision-making and implementation’. 37 37  MoD, ‘Women in Ground Close Combat (GCC) Review Paper’, p. 6, para. 22. In fairness it should be noted that the MoD also made use of Australian Army data on pelvic fractures and implementation, but US data was given much greater prominence in the review paper. See ibid., AnnexesB and E, pp. B-1 and E-1, paras. 22 and 3.

View all notes but the most intense interest is reserved for the Marines’ combat-effectiveness study. This examines the hypothesis that a mixed-gender infantry unit, operating under ‘gender-free’ standards, will perform as well as a single-gender infantry unit. 40 40  Although the term ‘gender free’ was used, ‘gender neutral’ may be more appropriate phraseology. View all notes A 651-strong battalion-level Ground Combat Element Integrated Task Force has been formed to test the hypothesis, with data becoming available in 2016. The experiment will refine ‘gender-free’ occupational standards, and seek to quantify tasks, conditions and standards that were previously only measurable on a qualitative basis. The trial results will not only offer greater confidence on the impact of the inclusion of women on combat effectiveness, but are also anticipated to determine the impact of lower survivability on cohesion. 41 41  MoD, ‘Women in Ground Close Combat (GCC) Review Paper’, p. 6, para. 22, subsection (a).

Increasingly, they have been required to conduct weapons searches of Muslim women in conflict zones. Patriotism and the rise in such gender-specific tasks have helped to increase the number of women in NATO armies.

We begin with setting the scene generally with an outline of IoT, followed by a discussion of IoT layer models and topologies.  After this, IoT standardization efforts and protocols are analysed, before we discuss in depth vulnerabilities, attacks and mitigations with regard IoT. It is concluded that ample research and narrative exists for protocols and vulnerabilities but less on mitigations, particularly with regard Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for IoT, and resource constraints on devices are a considerable obstacle in strengthening security.\nDocuments\nRights statement: Copyright 2016 The Author All rights reserved.

However, current work has mostly focused on IoT resource management while not on the access and utilisation of information generated by the ``Things''. We present the design of a comprehensive and lightweight semantic description model for knowledge representation in the IoT domain. The design follows the widely recognised best practices in knowledge engineering and ontology modelling. Users are allowed to extend the model by linking to external ontologies, knowledge bases or existing linked data. Scalable access to IoT services and resources is achieved through a distributed, semantic storage design. The usefulness of the model is also illustrated through an IoT service discovery method.\nReferences\n""","1.9050064","""https://automatika.korema.hr/index.php/automatika/article/view/414""","[-0.589514,51.242722]"

The resultant ice loss from Pine Island Glacier (PIG) and its neighboring ice streams presently contributes an estimated ∼10% to global sea level rise, motivating efforts to constrain better the rate of future ice retreat. One route toward gaining a better understanding of the processes required to underpin physically based projections is provided by examining assemblages of landforms and sediment exposed over recent decades by the ongoing ungrounding of PIG. Here we present high-resolution bathymetry and sub-bottom-profiler data acquired by autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveys beneath PIGIS in 2009 and 2014, respectively. We identify landforms and sediments associated with grounded ice flow, proglacial and subglacial sediment transport, overprinting of lightly grounded ice-shelf keels, and stepwise grounding line retreat. The location of a submarine ridge (Jenkins Ridge) coincides with a transition from exposed crystalline bedrock to abundant sediment cover potentially linked to a thick sedimentary basin extending upstream of the modern grounding line. The capability of acquiring high-resolution data from AUV platforms enables observations of landforms and understanding of processes on a scale that is not possible in standard offshore geophysical surveys.\n""","0.18441415","""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JF004311/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+7th+Oct+from+03.00+EDT+%2F+08%3A00+BST+%2F+12%3A30+IST+%2F+15.00+SGT+to+08.00+EDT+%2F+13.00+BST+%2F+17%3A30+IST+%2F+20.00+SGT+and+Sunday+8th+Oct+from+03.00+EDT+%2F+08%3A00+BST+%2F+12%3A30+IST+%2F+15.00+SGT+to+06.00+EDT+%2F+11.00+BST+%2F+15%3A30+IST+%2F+18.00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.+Apologies+for+the+inconvenience+caused+.""","[-2.099122,57.165019]"

It uses a match based learning mechanism to categorise inputs based on similarities in their features. However, this approach does not work well for neural control, where inputs have to be categorised based on the classes which they represent, rather than by the features of the input. To address this we propose and investigate ReART, a novel extension to Fuzzy ART. ReART uses a feedback based categorisation mechanism supporting class based input categorisation, online learning, and immunity from the plasticity stability dilemma. ReART is used for online control by integrating it with a separate external function which maps each ReART category to a desired output action. We test the proposal in the context of a simulated wireless data reader intended to be carried by an autonomous mobile vehicle, and show that ReART training time and accuracy are significantly better than both Fuzzy ART and Back Propagation. ReART is also compared to a Naïve Bayesian Classifier. Naïve Bayesian Classification achieves faster learning, but is less accurate in testing compared to both ReART, and Bach Propagation.\nBibliographic note\nLancaster University Bailrigg Lancaster United Kingdom LA1 4YW\n+44 (0)1524 65201\n""","0.2581798","""http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/reinforced-art-reart-for-online-neural-control(2b3a14e5-6fdd-4c3d-b3da-c33cd6f46ced).html""","[-2.787729,54.010394]"

Algorithms have been proposed and experimentally tested which allow three-dimensional co-ordinates to be derived from a defined object workspace. The use of stereoscopic imaging is not new; however, what is novel in this approach is the method used to produce panoramic images of the workspace surrounding the rotating line-scan camera. This system is particularly suited to applications which require the `all-round' observation of a scene. These include autonomous vehicle guidance and path-planning for complex manipulator manoeuvres. The results indicate that the positions of targets can be determined, at best, to a measurement accuracy of within\nmm in the X axis (horizontal),\nmm in the Y axis (vertical) and\nmm in the Z axis (range) at a camera-to-object range of 1.5 m.\nExport citation and abstract\n""","0.295716","""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-0233/9/3/005/meta""","[-1.152004,52.956363]"

Optimal multiprocesses are solutions to dynamic optimization problems described by families of control systems coupled through the boundary conditions and cost functions. The theory treats in a unified fashion a wide range of nonstandard dynamic optimization problems, and in many cases provides new optimality conditions. These include problems arising in impulse control, robotics, and optimal investment. Even when specialized to the (single process) free time optimal control problem, the theory improves on known necessary conditions.

In multi-parametric programming, advances include areas such as nonlinear multi-parametric programming (mp-NLP), bi-level programming, dynamic programming and global optimization for multi-parametric mixed-integer linear programming problems (mp-MILPs). In multi-parametric/explicit MPC (mp-MPC), advances include areas such as robust multi-parametric control, multi-parametric nonlinear MPC (mp-NMPC) and model reduction in mp-MPC. A comprehensive framework for multi-parametric programming and control is also presented. Recent applications include a hydrogen storage device, a fuel cell power generation system, an unmanned autonomous vehicle (UAV) and a hybrid pressure swing adsorption (PSA) system.\nKeywords\nMulti-parametric programming Bi-level programming Dynamic programming Control \nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access\nPreview\nUnable to display preview.  Download preview PDF.\nReferences\nAcevedo J, Pistikopoulos EN (1996) A parametric minlp algorithm for process synthesis problems under uncertainty.

It is shown how more reliable robot systems can be built using data abstraction and object-oriented programming, as supported within C plus plus , a general-purpose programming language. It is also shown how the constructor mechanism associated with C plus plus classes can be used to guarantee initialization and self-test of each subsystem of the robot. A complementary destructor mechanism can be used to guarantee safe termination of subsystems under most conditions. These mechanisms are completely transparent to both the user and his application program. Exception handling is discussed and it is shown how object-oriented programming facilities can be used to provide transparent recovery from subsytem failures during program execution, given some hardware redundancy.

A spiking neuro-evolutionary system is used for this purpose; plastic resistive memories are implemented as synapses in spiking neural networks. The evolutionary design process exploits parameter self-adaptation and allows the topology and synaptic weights to be evolved for each network in an autonomous manner. Variable resistive memories are the focus of this research; each synapse has its own conductance profile which modifies the plastic behaviour of the device and may be altered during evolution. These variable resistive networks are evaluated on a noisy robotic dynamic-reward scenario against two static resistive memories and a system containing standard connections only. The results indicate that the extra behavioural degrees of freedom available to the networks incorporating variable resistive memories enable them to outperform the comparative synapse types.\n© 2014 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n1  Introduction\nSection:\nNeuromorphic computing (NC; Mead, 1990 ) is a bio-inspired paradigm concerned with emulating brainlike functionality within artificial systems. Typical NC involves the use of a physical network composed of neurons (e.g., CMOS; Rabaey, 1996 ) that are interconnected by a dense web of nanoscale synapses. Resistive memories (RMs; Waser and Aono, 2007 ) are synapse-candidate devices—typically metal-insulator-metal—that can be induced to switch to one of several resistances through application of an appropriate voltage. They can be manufactured at the nanoscale and provide a nonvolatile memory whereby the state (resistance) of the device can vary depending on its activity. Nonvolatile memory faciliates low-heat, low-power storage (Ho et al., 2009 ), alleviating typical nanoscale concerns such as power usage and heat dissipation. A context-sensitive dynamic internal state allows synapse-like information processing. We categorise RMs as either resistive switching memories (RSMs; Waser and Aono, 2007 ) or memristors (memory-resistors; Chua, 1971 ) depending upon their characteristic behaviour. RSMs allow switching between (usually two) discrete resistance states, whereas memristors permit gradual traversal of a nonlinear resistance profile.\nNC requires some form of in-trial learning to harness the computational power of the network—typically a form of Hebbian learning (Hebb, 1949 ) is used to realise spike time dependent plasticity (STDP; Kistler, 2002 ). RM synapses alter their efficacy during the lifetime of the network, depending on the activity of the neurons they are connected to. The Hebbian mechanism is coupled with a neuro-evolutionary model that allows network topologies to be modified during the application of a genetic algorithm (GA; Holland, 1975 ). Self-adaptive search parameters are shown to provide a flexible learning architecture which may be especially beneficial given the autonomous nature of NC.\nA variable RM, the focus of this study, is an RM whose STDP response can be tuned by evolution, potentially imparting a variety of adaptive behaviours to the networks. Previous studies (Howard et al., 2012 ) have indicated that fixed STDP profiles can be exploited by evolution and cast into specific roles, such as facilitating or depressing synapses, with synaptic role based on STDP response—it follows that more varied responses may permit more finely-tuned behaviours within the networks.\nThe computational properties of two types of variable RM—memristor and RSM—are analysed when cast as synapses in evolutionary spiking neural networks (SNNs; Gerstner and Kistler, 2002 ). Our hypothesis is that the additional degrees of functional freedom afforded to the variable RM networks can be harnessed by the evolutionary process. To test this hypothesis, the variable memristor and variable RSM networks are compared to networks composed of (1) PEO-PANI memristors (Erokhin and Fontana, 2008 ), (2) HP memristors (Strukov et al., 2008 ), and (3) constant, non-plastic connections. A dynamic simulated robotics navigation task is selected for this purpose. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that allows for the self-adaptation of the characteristic performance of the RMs alongside neuroevolution of both neurons and connection structure.\n2  Background\nSection:\n2.1  Spiking Networks\nSNNs present a phenomenological model of neural activity in the brain. In an SNN, neurons are linked via unidirectional, weighted connections. Each neuron has a measure of excitation, or membrane potential, and communicates via the voltage spike, or action potential. A neuron spikes when its membrane potential exceeds some threshold, which typically requires a cluster of incoming spikes arriving within a short time period. A spike emitted from a neuron is received by all connected postsynaptic neurons.\nAs the membrane potential may be considered a form of memory, such networks are able to produce temporally dynamic activation patterns, which potentially allows for increased computing power (Maass, 1996 ; Saggie-Wexler et al., 2006 ) when considering temporal problems (e.g., robotics, time series analysis), compared to “stateless” network models such as the multi layer perceptron (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986 ; although continuous time recurrent neural networks can use internal dynamics to the same effect, e.g., Blynel and Floreano, 2003 ). SNNs are preferred because the voltage spike is an efficient medium of communication when compared to traditional schemes where voltage is constantly applied to a connection. The benefits of such a scheme—low-heat, low-power communication—are heightened when coupled with nonvolatile synapses (such as the RMs used herein), as sparse pulse-based encoding schemes may be envisioned.\nTwo well-known formal SNN implementations are the leaky integrate and fire (LIF) model and the spike response model (SRM; Gerstner and Kistler, 2002 ). Neuro-evolution applies evolutionary techniques to alter the topology/weights of neural networks. Floreano et al. ( 2008 ) survey various methods for evolving both weights and architectures. Nolfi and Floreano ( 2000 ) describe the evolution of networks for robotics tasks.\n2.2  Resistive Memories\nNumerous RMs have been previously manufactured from a plethora of materials—Akinaga and Shima ( 2010 ) provide a summary. RSMs are predominantly metal oxides (HfO2, Cu2O, ZnO, ZrO2, TiO2). Memristor materials are more varied, and include conductive polymers (Erokhin and Fontana, 2008 ), metal silicides (Jo et al., 2010 ), and crystalline oxides (Doolittle et al., 2009 ) in addition to certain metal oxides.\nOne popular theory, espoused by Waser and Aono ( 2007 ), states that the resistance profiles of both types of RM are considered to be the result of the appearance of filaments in the substrate, which may arise due to material defects or conditions during synthesis. Filaments are conductive pathways through the material that allow electrons to flow through them. In our taxonomy, memristors, as shown in Figure 1 (a), do not form complete filaments, giving rise to the characteristic nonlinear I-V curves of these devices as other mechanisms (such as ionic conductivity) play a more prominent role in electron transport, as shown in Figure 1 (b). Complete filament formation occurs in the case of RSMs, as shown in Figure 1 (c), which results in ohmic I-V profiles, as shown in Figure 1 (d). This distinction is not universal (e.g., under specific conditions an RSM may act like memristor, and vice versa).\nFigure 1: (a) Incomplete filament formation (memristor)—as there are no complete filaments, ionic conductivity gives rise to (b) generalised HP memristor I-V curve, (c) complete filament formation (RSM); dark lines show complete filaments, (d) generalised RSM I-V curve, dashed line showing a possible current compliance. The steeper gradient is the LRS, the shallower is the HRS.\n2.2.1  Memristors\nThe memristor, a class of RM theoretically characterized by Chua ( 1971 ), has recently enjoyed a resurgence of interest after being manufactured from titanium oxide by HP labs (Strukov et al., 2008 ). Memristors are the fourth fundamental circuit element, joining the capacitor, inductor, and resistor. Like RSMs, memristors can be operated as binary switches; we forgo this method of operation and use the memristor as an analogue device capable of incremental resistance alteration.\nAs filaments are not formed, some other conductivity mechanism is used instead; in this case ionic conductivity gives rise to the nonlinear I-V curve seen in Figure 1 (d). An explanatory model of the titanium dioxide device can be seen in Figure 2 . Here, the memristor is modeled as two variable resistors Ron and Roff. The instantaneous resistance of the device can be attributed to the position of the boundary between Ron (which is doped with oxygen vacancies, on charge carriers, and therefore has low resistance) and Roff (which displays higher resistance). Charge flowing through the memristor in a given direction causes the oxygen vacancies to migrate in that direction, moving the boundary between Ron and Roff and altering the resistance of the device. Nonvolatility arises due to the chemical nature of the mechanism; Strukov et al. ( 2008 ) provide more details.\nFigure 2: Generalised memristor model shown as two resistors whose boundary, and hence final resistance, varies depending on the polarity of the input charge. Resistor Ron contains oxygen vacancies (black dots), which act as charge carriers, and possesses low resistance; resistor Roff has no vacancies and a high resistance. From an initial boundary position (Centre), charge flowing from the positive terminal to negative terminal causes the vacancies to percolate towards the negative terminal (Right), increasing the size of Ron which decreases the resistance of the device. The opposite is true for charge flowing from the negative to the positive port (Left).\nFormally, a memristor is a passive two-terminal electronic device that is described by the relation between the device terminal voltage v, terminal current i (which is related to the charge q transferred onto the device), and magnetic flux\n, as Equation ( 1 ) shows. Resistance can be made to increase or decrease depending on the polarity of the voltage. The nonvolatile resistance, M, is a nonlinear function of the charge as shown in Equation ( 2 ).\n(1)\n(2)\nPrevious applications of memristors within neural paradigms are ubiquitous: Titanium dioxide memristors (Strukov et al., 2008 ) have been used in the manufacture of nanoscale neural crossbars (Snider, 2005 ), and silver silicide memristors have been shown to function in neural architectures (Jo et al., 2010 ). Other successful applications include the modelling of learning in amoeba (Pershin et al., 2009 ), as well as pattern recognition by crossbar circuits for robotic control (Mouttet, 2009 ). In particular, Mouttet ( 2009 ) highlights the attractive prospect of applying evolutionary computation techniques directly to memristive hardware, as memristors can simultaneously perform the functions of both processor and memory.\n2.2.2  Resistive Switching Memories\nAs their nomenclature implies, RSMs are typically used as a bistable resistive switch; pulsing with a voltage over some threshold transfers the device from an initial low-resistance state (LRS) to a high-resistance state (HRS). Successive voltage pulses can then be used to switch between these states; the amount of voltage required depends on the physical properties of the device. RSMs are typically metal-insulator-metal devices that are composed of an ion-conducting semiconductor sandwiched between two layers of metal. Electroforming creates complete filaments, which provide ohmic conductance in the LRS. Driving over a threshold voltage breaks these filaments and transfers the device to the HRS. A further voltage spike (usually in conjuction with a current compliance to protect the device) reforms these filaments and reinstates the LRS—see Figure 1 (c)–(d). RSMs follow Equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ), under the proviso that M is now a linear function of charge. RSMs are not sensitive to the polarity of voltage used. Examples of RSMs are confined to binary operation, for example, as resistive random access memory (Akinaga and Shima, 2010 ; Hosoi et al., 2006 ), although neural implementations exist (Xia et al., 2005 ).\n2.3  Synaptic Plasticity\nHebbian learning (Hebb, 1949 ) is thought to account for adaptation and learning in the brain. Briefly, Hebbian learning states that “neurons that fire together, wire together”—in other words, in the event that a presynaptic neuron causes a postsynaptic neuron to fire, the synaptic strength between those two neurons increases so that such an event is more likely to happen in the future. Such a mechanism allows for self-organising, correlated activation patterns.\nSpike time dependent plasticity (STDP; Kistler, 2002 ) was originally formulated as a way of implementing Hebbian learning within computer-based neural networks. Interestingly, the STDP equation has been found to have distinct similarities to the reality of Hebbian learning in biological synapses (Bi and Poo, 1998 ). It has recently been postulated that a memristance-like mechanism affects synaptic efficacy in biological neural networks (Linares-Barranco and Serrano-Gotarredona, 2009 ), based on similarities between memristive equations and their neural counterparts. Querlioz et al. ( 2011 ) have recently shown that memristive STDP can be made to mitigate device variations that are currently intrinsic to hardware memristor realisation.\nTypically when implementing STDP with RMs of both kinds, a bidirectional voltage spike is emitted by a neuron whose membrane potential exceeds some threshold. Bidirectional spikes are a necessity as they allow the temporal coincidence of spikes across a synapse to be tracked. The spike can be approximated by either a continuous (Afifi et al., 2009 ; Linares-Barranco and Serrano-Gotarredona, 2009 ) or discrete (Jo et al., 2010 ; Snider, 2008 ) waveform through time, which is transmitted to all synapses that the neuron is connected to (presynaptic or postsynaptic). In the case of memristors, if the instantaneous voltage across a synapse surpasses some threshold—typically when the waveforms sufficiently overlap—the conductance of the synapse changes. For RSMs, multiple consecutive voltage spikes of a given polarity within a short time frame are required to switch the device from one state to the other. Note that this removes the element of biological realism from RSM STDP while providing a fast-switching binary behaviour.\nThe notion that varied plastic behaviours could be combined in a single network is an attractive one from a computing perspective, as more functional degrees of freedom may be afforded to the synapses. Additionally, certain synaptic behaviours may be more beneficial than others in certain positions within the network. Integration of neuroevolution with heterogeneous neuromoduation rules is investigated by Soltoggio ( 2008 ), and has been extended to robot controllers (Durr et al., 2008 ). Increased behavioural diversity (and high-quality pathfinding in the latter case) is reported. Probabilistic spike emission, which is governed by modulatory Hebbian rules, has also been investigated (Maass and Zador, 1999 ). The authors show a biologically-plausible mechanism capable of computing with short spike trains where the population of synapses display heterogeneous probabilities of transmitting/blocking a spike. Urzelai and Floreano ( 2001 ) present a nodes-only encoding scheme where synapses are affected by four versions of the Hebb rule, which generates pathfinding behaviour online from initially random actions. Synaptic weights are not evolved; instead, evolution is performed on the rules which govern how synapses react to STDP. High adaptability to new environments is evidenced. Since synaptic strength is not directly modelled and all synapses at a given node display homogenous STDP behaviour, it is unclear how to transition such a scheme to memristive/hardware implementations. Howard et al. ( 2012 ) used memristive STDP to vary the behaviour of a synapse (and therefore the network) during a trial. In this study, we extend this concept to allow for variable RMs of both types, whereby the STDP response of the synapse can be tailored by evolution to suit its role within the network.\n2.4  Viability of a Variable Resistive Memory\nConceptually, a variable RM can be seen as a nonvolatile, low power, and behaviourally diverse synapse candidate for neuromorphic hardware. A lingering question is then: How do we know that variable RMs are physically realisable? Although the field is very much in its infancy, there are a number of reasons to believe that the networks produced will have a physical analog.\nThe STDP response of the memristors can be encapsulated in a “physical properties” parameter, where changing this parameter varies the behaviour of the synapse. The memristor physical properties parameter\n(first used by Howard et al., 2012 ; derived from the original equations by Strukov et al., 2008 ) is given as\n, where\nis the mobility of oxygen vacancies and D is the device thickness in nanometres. Gale ( 2012 ) presents a more detailed model, which indicates that varying the electrode size also affects memristance, and has some experimental verification (Gale, de Lacy Costello, et al., 2012 ). Due to the relationship between\nand D, it can be inferred that a smaller D will generate a larger memristive effect: as memristiance is more pronounced at smaller scales, many memristive devices are therefore likely to be manufactured at compatible (nano) scales. As\nwas originally derived from modelling of physical devices,\nvalues in the range of those proposed in this article are potentially viable. Variations of a small D can also create a greater potential variance in\nfor a given\n, meaning that the amount of synaptic variance available to any newly-found memristor is predicted to increase with increasing miniturisation. Finally, the sizes of D given for current memristor models predict a scale that is small enough to permit sufficient synaptic density for neuromorphic hardware implementations—equivalent to that found in the human brain.\nAnother possible method of varying the STDP response of a memristor requires irradiation by an ion beam, as described by Vujisic et al. ( 2010 ). Simulations of irradiated titanium dioxide memristors were found to possess a lower oxygen vacancy mobility (\n) and reduced resistance in the doped region (Ron). Additionally, selective bombardment of specific synapses could alter synaptic behaviour in an online manner, although the precise method of targeted radiation delivery would depend upon the physical structure of the network. Advantages of this approach include online behaviour modification, the ability to elicit varied STDP responses from a homogenous group of memristors postfabrication, and potentially including this mechanism as part of a feedback loop during evolution.\nRSMs could be adapted in a similar manner to\n, where varying the device would in this case change its switching sensitivity. As RSMs can be made from titanium dioxide, they are also candidates for control via irradiation (Vujisic et al., 2010 ). A benefit of the physical properties parameter is that, as it is implicitly grounded in reality, the dimensions of the RM corresponding to a given parameter value can be calculated and used as a best fit for reconstructing simulated networks with available hardware devices. This is especially pertinent as our research group is capable of creating and profiling both types of RM (Gale, Pearson et al., 2012 ).\nIn summary, (1) RMs are suitable synapse candidates, (2) STDP is a popular means to achieving learning within RM spiking networks, and (3) motivation for researching a variable RM has been given.\n3  The System\nSection:\nThe system consists of 100 SNNs which are evaluated on a robotics test problem, and altered via a steady-state GA. Each experiment lasts for 1,000 evolutionary generations; two new networks are created and trialled on the test problem per generation. Each trial consists of 8,000 time steps, which begin with the reading of sensory information and calculation of action, and end with the agent performing that action. Every time step comprises 21 steps of SNN processing, at the end of which the action is calculated. The state of the system was sampled every 20 generations and used to create the results. Results were averaged over 30 experimental repeats.\n3.1  Control Architecture\nSpiking network implementation is based on the LIF model. Neurons are arranged into a three-layer (input, hidden, output) network without recurrency but with hidden-hidden neuron connectivity. Each neuron has a membrane potential y>0 which slowly degrades over time, and can be modified either by an external current or by spikes received from presynaptic neurons. As spikes are received by the neuron, the value of y is increased in the case of an excitatory spike, or decreased if the spike is inhibitory. If y surpasses a positive threshold\nthe neuron spikes and transmits an action potential to every neuron to which it is presynaptic, with strength relative to the synaptic weight between those two neurons. The neuron then resets its membrane potential to prevent oversaturation; for a given neuron, y at time t is given as in Equation ( 3 )\n(3)\n(4)\nEquation ( 4 ) shows the reset formula. Here, y(t) is the membrane potential at time t, I is the input current to the neuron, a is a positive constant, b is the degradation (leak) constant and c is the reset membrane potential of the neuron. A model of temporal delays is used so that, in the single hidden layer only, a spike sent to a neuron not immediately neighbouring the sending neuron is received x steps after it is sent, where x is the number of neurons between the sending neuron and receiving neuron. Each output neuron has an activation window that records the number of spikes produced by that neuron at each time step.\nSNN parameters are initial hidden layer nodes =9, a=0.3, b=0.05, c=0.0, cini=0.5,\n, output window size =21. Previous experimentation has shown that these parameters, specifically the initial hidden-layer nodes and output window size, have relatively little effect on network performance. Fewer initial hidden-layer neurons can restrict possible topologies (and therefore possible output responses) during early generations, resulting in a slightly longer learning process. Output window size is experimentally set to allow a reasonable amount of STDP activity per agent movement. Parameters are chosen to strike a balance between system performance and evaluation time. A typical SNN is shown in Figure  3 (a).\nFigure 3: (a) A typical SNN architecture. In the hidden layer, white neurons denote excitatory neurons and black neurons signify inhibitory neurons. (b) Khepera sensory arrangement. Three light sensors and three IR sensors share positions 0, 2, and 5 and form the network input. Two bump sensors, B1 and B2, are shown attached at\nangles to the front-left and front-right of the robot.\nThe SNNs were used to control a simulated Khepera II robot with eight light sensors and eight distance sensors. At each time step (64 ms in simulation time), the agent sampled its light sensors, whose values ranged from eight (fully illuminated) to 500 (no light); and IR distance sensors, whose response values ranged from 0 (no object detected) to 1,023 (object very close). All sensor readings were scaled to the range [0,1] (0 being unactivated, 1 being highly activated) before being input to the SNN. Six sensors comprised the input state for the SNN, three IR and three light sensors at positions 0, 2, and 5 as shown in Figure  3 (b). Additionally, two bump sensors were added to the front-left and front-right of the agent to prevent it from becoming stuck against an object. If either bump sensor were activated, an interrupt was sent, causing the agent to reverse 10 cm and the agent to be penalised by 10 time steps. Movement values and sensory update delays were constrained by accurate modelling of physical Khepera agent. Sensory noise was added based on Webots Khepera data;\n2% noise for IR sensors and\n10% noise for light sensors, all randomly sampled from a uniform distribution. Wheel slippage was also included (10% chance). The spike trains of the output neurons were discretised into high or low activated (high activation if more than half of the 21 SNN processing steps generated a spike at the neuron, low otherwise). Three actions were possible: forward (maximum movement on both left and right wheels, high activation of both output neurons), and continuous turns to both the left (high activation on the first output neuron, low on the second) and right (low activation on the first output neuron, high on the second)—caused by halving the left/right motor outputs, respectively. Three discrete actions are used to encourage more distinct changes in network activity when generating and transitioning between these actions, allowing a detailed analysis of such disparities to be performed.\n3.1.1  Benchmark Synapse Types\nFrom the description of SNNs in Section 2.1 and that of RMs in Section 2.2 , the strength of a connection weight in a neural network can be intuitively seen as the inverse resistance of that connection. The impact of a synapse on the functionality of the network depends on the modelling equations and parameters used. In this section, the equations governing the two comparative memristors (HP and PEO-PANI) and the constant connection are described. The HP memristor was chosen for study as it is well understood. The PEO-PANI memristor is also well-understood, but more importantly has a strongly different STDP profile (see Figure  1 (d)), which allows for contrasting behaviour. Importantly, when considering future hardware endeavours, both of these memristors are more likely than comparable devices to be available in sufficient quantities.\nThese synapse types have been previously compared (Howard et al., 2012 ); the main findings of the study were (1) memristive STDP was used to generate highly fit solutions, (2) the evolutionary algorithm assigned roles to the synapses based on their STDP behaviours (HP memristors were statistically more frequently connected to an inhibitory neuron, PEO-PANI were more frequently attached to an excitatory neuron), and (3) self-adaptive search parameters were found to be context-sensitive and beneficial to the evolution of the networks. In this study, these synapses serve as a means of comparison to the new variable devices.\n3.1.1.1 HP Memristor\nThe HP memristor is comprised of thin-film titanium dioxide (TiO2) and titanium dioxide with oxygen vacancies (TiO(2-x)), which have different resistances. The boundary between the two compounds moves in response to the charge on the memristor, which in turn alters the resistance of the device as delineated in Figure  2 . To allow for a future transition into variable synapses, memristance equations are rearranged based on the originals provided by Strukov et al. ( 2008 ).\nIn the following equations, W is the scaled weight (conductance) of the connection, G is the unscaled weight of the connection, M is the memristance, sf1 and sf2 are scale factors, Roff is the resistance of the TiO2, Ron is the resistance of the oxygen-depleted TiO(2-x), q is the charge on the device, and qmin is the minimum allowed charge.\nencompasses the physical properties of the device. The original profiles, used for the benchmark memristors, are recreated using a rescaled\n, Ron=0.01, Roff=1, qmin=0.0098.\n(5)\nFigure  4 (a) shows that HP and PEO-PANI memristors display increased sensitivity (larger\nper STDP event) when\nis a low number and either W>0.1 for HP-governed synapses, or W<0.9 for PEO-PANI-governed profiles.\nFigure 5: Showing a positive STDP event for a memristor. A presynaptic voltage spike is received at time t−1, with a postsynaptic voltage spike at time t. Combined, the voltage surpasses\n, increasing the conductivity of the device. (b) In the case of the RSM, consecutive voltage spikes (l.h.s. Sn=3, r.h.s. Sn=4) serve to push the voltage past a threshold, causing a switch. Dotted lines show the derived voltage threshold. Voltage spike values are decremented by one per subsequent time step.\nRSM STDP parameters are Sn, which encapulates the sensitivity of the device to voltage buildup (in the form of repeated STDP spikes), and Sc, which tracks the number of consecutive STDP events the synapse has experienced. All synapses are initially in the low resistance state (W=0.9). At each step, every synapse is checked as before, incrementing Sc if an STDP event occurs at the synapse and decrementing Sc if no STDP event occurs at that step. If Sn=Sc, the RSM switches to the high resistance state (W=0.1) and Sc is reset to 0. The RSM can switch back and forth between the LRS and HRS during a trial. Note that the polarity of the voltage spike in RSM networks is always the same, regardless of the coincidence of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes across the device.\nFigure  5 (b) shows how this mechanism compares to regular STDP. Due to the requirement of consecutive STDP events, the actual frequency of synapse alteration is lower than that seen in the memristive networks. The number of consecutive spikes required can be seen as an analogue to a higher voltage threshold which is required to switch. Note that q is no longer instrumental to the functioning of the device; that is, RSMs are related to voltage-threshold rather than being charge-controlled. Because of this, the network architectures required to handle the two RMs (memristive and RSM) are assumed to be incompatible with each other.\nWe note that LS may be discussed in the context of RSMs and must be set equal to Sn to allow the device to surpass this threshold in the face of voltage dissipation, which acts to lower the value of the waveform through time.\nmay also be derived and varies according to Sn, although its value is not necessarily required to model the device. After an RM network is trialled, all synapses are reset to their original weights (0.5 for memristors, 0.9 for RSMs).\n3.2  Evolutionary Algorithm\nHaving described the component parts of our networks, we now detail the implementation of the GA that acts on them. Per generation, two parents are selected fitness-proportionately, mutated, and used to create two offspring. We use only mutation to explore weight space; crossover is omitted as sufficient solution space exploration can be obtained via a combination of self-adaptive weight and topology mutations; a view that is reinforced in the literature (e.g., Rocha et al., 2003 ). The offspring are inserted into the population and two networks with the lowest fitness are deleted.\nEach network is respresented by two variable-length vectors, one containing neurons and the other connections. A neuron is defined by its type (excitatory or inhibitory), membrane potential, and last spike value LS. A connection is defined by its type (e.g., HP memistor), weight, charge,\n, and the neurons it connects. These two vectors are augmented by self-adaptive parameters that control various rates of mutation. Mutatable network parameters are neuron type, synaptic weight (in non-RM networks),\n(in variable memristor networks), Sn (in variable RSM networks), and associated self-adaptive parameters. Neurons and connections may be added/removed from their respective vectors by the GA.\nThe use of a self-adaptive framework is justified when the application area of neuromorphic computing is considered—that is, when brainlike systems must be able to autonomously adapt to a changing environment and adjust their learning accordingly. This potentially allows increased structural stability in highly fit networks while enabling less useful networks to vary more strongly per GA application. Mechanistically, self-adaptation also permits the use of self-repair/self-modification, wherein the GA is able to (1) in a stable environment, lower mutation rates to enable homeostasis or provide incremental, gradual improvements or (2) when the environment rapidly changes, or part of the network fails, increase learning rates to more quickly adapt to these new conditions. When coupled with neuroevolution, the effect is to tailor the evolution of the network to the complexity of the environment explicitly, that is, each network controls its own architecture autonomously in terms of (1) amount of mutation that takes place in a given network at a given time (2) adapting the hidden-layer topology of the neural networks to reflect the complexity of the problem considered by the network, as shown by Hurst and Bull ( 2006 ). This mechanism was first used with SNNs by Howard ( 2010 ). We note that the benefits of this approach will be more pronounced in hardware implementations, which will be the topic of future research.\n3.2.1  Self-Adaptive Mutation\nWe use self-adaptive mutation rates as in evolutionary strategies (ESs; Rechenberg, 1973 ), to dynamically control the frequency and magnitude of mutation events taking place in each network. Here, the rate of mutation per allele\nof each network is initialized uniformly randomly in the range [0, 0.25]. During a GA cycle, a parent's\nis modified as in Equation ( 19 ) (where N denotes a normal distribution); the offspring then adopts this new\nand mutates itself by this value, before being inserted into the population.\n(19)\nOnly non-RM networks can alter their connection weights via the GA. Connection weights in this case are initially set during network creation, node addition, and connection addition randomly uniformly in the range [0, 1]. Memristive network connections are always set to 0.5, and cannot be mutated from this value. The aim of setting this value is to force the memristive networks to harness the plasticity of their connections during a trial to successfully solve the problem.\n3.2.2  Control of Variable Synapses\nThe STDP responses of the variable synapses are governed by the self-adaptive parameter\n, which is initialised and self-adapted as with\n. In the case of the variable memristor, mutation changes a synapse's\nby\n. Offspring networks have their parents’\nand\nvalues modified using Equation ( 19 ) as with\n, with neuron addition/removal occurring after mutation. Added nodes are initially excitatory with 50% probability, otherwise they are inhibitory.\nAutomatic feature selection is a method of reducing the dimensionality of the data input to a process by using computational techniques to select and operate exclusively on a subset of inputs taken from the entire set. In the context of neural networks, feature selection can disable synaptic (traditionally input) connections. In this study we allow each connection to be individually enabled/disabled, a mechanism termed connection selection. During a GA cycle, a connection can be added or removed from the connection vector based on a new self-adaptive parameter\n(which is initialised and self-adapted in the same manner as\nand\n). If a connection is added for a nonmemristive network, its connection weight is randomly initialised uniformly in the range [0, 1], memristive connections are always set to 0.5. During a node addition event, new connections are set probabilistically, with P=0.5 of each possible neural connection being added. Connection selection is particularly important to the memristive networks. As they cannot alter connection weights via the GA, variance induced in network connectivity patterns plays a large role in the generation of STDP in the networks. Likewise, RSM networks rely on connection selection to generate synchronised synaptic excitations/inhibitions, which allow the network to generate appropriate output actions.\n3.3  Task\nThe main advantage of STDP is the ability to vary during a trial in response to a dynamically-changing environment. To demonstrate the ability of variable RM synapses to handle dynamic reward scenarios, an experiment was simulated in a T-maze (e.g., Blynel and Floreano, 2003 ) scenario, as used by Soltoggio et al. ( 2008 ) to investigate the adaptivity of plastic networks. In particular, the variable memristor (MEM) and RSM (RSM) elements were compared to the static HP (HP) and PEO-PANI (PEO) memristors, and the constant connection or nonswitching RSM (CONST). The popular robotics simulator Webots (Michel, 2004 ) was chosen; alternatives are summarised by Craighead et al. ( 2007 ).\nThe environment was an enclosed arena with coordinates ranging from [−1, 1] in both x and y directions, and is shown in Figure  6 to represent a T. The agent is initialised facing north in a zone at the bottom of the T (delineated in Figure  6 with a checkered pattern). Reward zones R1 and R2 were situated at the end of the left and right arms, respectively. A light source, modelled on a 15 W lightbulb, was placed at the top-centre of the arena (x=0.5, y=1) and was used by the network for action calculation.\nFigure 6: The T-maze. The agent (white circle) begins in the checkered box and must travel to R1 or R2. The light source is shown (top-centre).\nDuring a trial, the agent initially learned to navigate to R1. Once stable pathfinding to R1 was attained, the reward zone was switched to R2 and the agent reinitialised in the start zone. To give the agent memory of the first part of the trial, the membrane potentials and synaptic weights of the controlling network were not reset during this process. This task is dynamic as the reward zone changes so the agent must forget its previously-learned behaviour after a time and adapt to a newly-positioned goal state. A network that located R2 following location of R1 was said to have solved the trial. The measure of fitness used, f, was simply the total number of steps required to solve the trial. Each network was permitted 4,000 steps to locate R1, plus an additional 4,000 steps to locate R2.\n4  Results\nSection:\nIn the following discussion, best fitness refers to the lowest-fitness network in each experimental repeat (lower fitness denoted higher solution quality). Average fitness was the mean fitness of the population of networks. Neurons listed the average final number of connected neurons in the population, and connectivity was the average percentage of enabled connections in the population. All of the above measurements were averaged over the 30 experimental repeats. Two-tailed t-tests were used to assess statistical significance.\nFigures  7 (a) and 7 (b) show that both variable network types generate solutions with better average fitness and best fitness than their static counterparts (for best fitness, MEM and RSM were both p<.05 vs. HP, PEO, and CONST; for average fitness MEM was p<.05 vs. HP and PEO, RSM was p<.05 vs. HP, PEO, and CONST). This is an encouraging result, as in addition to outperforming the majority of the nonvariable synapses, the variable RM synapses induce no significant performance overhead that may have arisen due to the increased search/behaviour space that the GA has to deal with. The average fitness of HP networks is due to much of the population not being able to perform both parts of the trial; best fitness is still comparable to the other nonvariable network types. When comparing the two variable RM networks, we note that the average fitness of RSM networks is significantly (p<.05) lower than that of MEM networks.\nFigure 7: Box plots showing average (a) best fitness, (b) mean fitness, (c) connected hidden layer nodes, (d) enabled connections, (e)\n, (f)\n, and (h)\nfor the T-maze experiment.\nThe best single network of each type had the following fitness values: MEM=839, RSM=879, PEO=956, CONST=915, HP=901. MEM networks generated the highest quality (single) solution, 2.56 s faster than the best-evolved RSM network. As the pathfinding function is better-approximated, GA-tuned STDP behaviour of the MEM synapses is said to be capable of the most complex responses to environmental stimuli.\nVariable RMs are also found to be easier to evolve for this task—both MEM and RSM networks take statistically (p<.05) fewer generations to generate a solution that successfully solves the task compared to all other synapse types, indicating that a greater rate of adaptation is possible when using variable synapses. The average number of generations to create a network that solves the problem are RSM=19.3, MEM=27.7, PEO=46.2, HP=890.5, and GA=66.3. Compared to RSM networks, MEM networks appear to require more GA tuning of\nto generate functional solutions, due to the larger and more fine-grained search space of\ncompared to Sn.\nRSM networks possess the fewest average neurons per network. MEM networks contain more excitatory neurons (average 13.9) than they do inhibitory (average 3.2, p<.05), the most likely explanation being that a given level of network activity is required to generate all required behaviours given an arbitrary input state. RSM networks possess an approximately equal distribution of neuron types because the neurons are ambivalent to the polarity of the incoming voltage spikes (average 6.7 excitatory neurons, 5.9 inhibitory neurons).\nMEM networks were more densely connected (average 53.6%) than their RSM counterparts (average 50.9%, p<.05). Denser synaptic topologies were required for MEM networks as more of the computational power of the network is embodied in the synapse itself (a notion echoed in recent literature, Abbott and Regehr, 2004 ). When a single MEM synapse is compared to a single RSM synapse, it is evidenced that the MEM device is capable of temporal behaviour that is more complex and granular; however, the RSM network as a whole overcomes a lack of synaptic complexity via arrangements of simpler devices and synchronised LRS/HRS switching to generate useful spike patterns. HP networks are also more densely connected than RSM (average 53.3%, p<.05), although this is likely due to the requirement for additional synapses to percolate sufficient activity through the network given the tendency of the HP memristor to either become stuck in a low-conductivity region of its STDP profile or be used as a depressing synapse, for example, with a presynaptic inhibitory neuron (Howard et al., 2012 , provide in-depth analysis).\nIn terms of computational complexity, we observe that MEM and RSM networks possess more complex temporal dynamics than the other STDP-enabled network types. Complexity in MEM networks is evidenced through a heterogeneous collaboration of myriad STDP responses. In contrast, complexity in RSM networks is mainly due to the creation of synchronised weight oscillators within the network which are required for high-fitness behaviour generation. In either case, synaptic activity (as opposed to neuron activity) is seen to be the main driver of action generation—the computational onus is seen to be taken from neuron and reattributed to the synapse.\nConnection selection approximately halves the amount of connections used by the networks (Figure  7 (d) shows connectivity varying between 50.9–53.7%). Considering possible NC applications, the integration of mechanisms such as synaptic redundancy, self-repair, and self-modification could be eased by the sparse connectivity of the generated solutions. In eventual hardware implementations, more synapses will be available to implement these mechanisms when compared to solutions that do not use this technique.\nFigures  7 (e)–(h) show that all parameters decline from their original values. MEM networks are seen to possess higher average\n(rate of connection selection, 0.043) than both RSM (0.029), HP (0.03), and CONST (0.033) networks (p<.05). While proving the context-sensitivity of self-adaptation, this result also relates to the idea that MEM synapses are more computationally powerful, and therefore the networks (1) require more connections, and (2) need to experiment more with synaptic configurations via connection selection to generate highly fit solutions. Iota, which controls the frequency of variable synapse alteration events, varies between MEM and RSM with p=.481.\nWhen self-adaptive parameters from the same network type are compared, all are observed to be significantly (p<.05) different from each other—compare Figure  7 (e)–(h). Self-adaptation is shown to be context-sensitive, with the GA automatically discovering preferential values for each parameter based on its role in the generation of fit solutions.\n4.1  Analysis of Synapse Variability\n4.1.1  Variable Memristor Networks\nin the range 1–100. A PEO-PANI-governed profile with\nwould therefore have a recalculated value of 101+50=151.\nVariation appears in the distribution of profile types in MEM networks, shown in Figure  8 (a). Synapses are more frequently governed by HP profiles (average 41.4 synapses per network) than PEO-PANI-governed synapses (average 36.9 synapses per network, p<.05). More prolific use of HP-governed profiles, which provide lower average efficacy, can be seen as a way to balance network activity given the increased connectivity of MEM networks in general. Figure  8 (b) shows the distribution of profile types per layer over time. It was observed that HP-governed profiles were more frequently found connecting two hidden-layer neurons (20.6 vs. 17.8 average PEO-PANI-governed connections, p<.05), but were less frequent than PEO-PANI profiles when connecting sensors (input layer) to the hidden layer. This shows that values of\nare selected to permit swifter weight change per STDP event when connecting sensors into the network, enabling a more expedient network response to changing environmental conditions (mainly to allow for different actions to be more quickly calculated from similar environmental conditions when R1 changes to R2).\nFigure 8: Number of connections belonging to (a) each profile type overall in MEM networks, (b) each profile type per layer in MEM networks. M = mean of all networks, B = numbers from best network of each experimental repeat.\n4.1.2  Variable RSM Networks\nNo differences were found with respect to the type (inhibitory/excitatory) of neuron that synapses of each Sn connect, with p-values ranging from 0.59 to 0.99. We note that lower Sn (Sn=2–3) synapses are found connecting input neurons to the hidden layer, with Sn=4–6 synapses more prevalent when connecting two hidden-layer neurons, suggesting that fast-switching synapses are required to immediately generate activity within the network. IR sensors have lower Sn than light sensors as they trigger only when near obstacles and so must be able to quickly switch to peturb network output and avoid the obstacle.\nNo significant results were observed with respect to the type of neuron (excitatory or inhibitory) that the synapses were presynaptic/postsynaptic to in RSM networks (all p>.05), reinforcing the notion that the timing of weight switches within the networks requires subnetworks of synapses with varying temporal behaviour. This is opposed to MEM networks which assign distinct roles to individual synapses based on their behaviour under STDP.\n4.1.3  STDP\nThe ability of a network to generate high-quality overall solutions despite the in-trial movement of the goal state is implicitly linked to its ability to alter its internal dynamics during runtime using STDP. The need to search this additional space during GA application is offset by the increased power of the synapses (for MEM networks) or the increased power of the possible internal network dynamics (for RSM networks). For MEM and RSM networks, the ability of a variable synapse to tailor its behaviour more accurately than the other synapse types is recognised and harnessed by the evolutionary process, resulting in the observed differences in best fitness and average fitness.\nUse of STDP by the best MEM network is shown in Figure  9 , and to give an example of the network's in-trial variance, the network itself is provided in Figure  10 . HP-governed profiles were found to quickly reduce synaptic efficacy to the left (right) motor, causing peturbation of calculated action during turn by bringing that motor below the high activated threshold. PEO-PANI-governed MEM profiles to the same motor were used to swiftly increase the level of spiking activity (usually in response to a light sensor surpassing/coming under some threshold) until a forward action was calculated after the turn was completed. HP profiles were statistically (p<.05) more likely to be found reducing a synapse's efficacy. In contrast, PEO-PANI-governed profiles were statistically (p<.05) more likely to be found increasing a synapse's efficacy. PEO-PANI-governed profiles experience statistically (p<.05) more positive STDP and statistically (p<.05) fewer negative STDP events than HP-governed profiles. These findings seem to concur with previous work by Howard et al. ( 2012 ), in which static PEO memristors were found to be better suited to conducting weight through the network (with the opposite being true for HP memristors). The evolutionary process harnessed the differing profiles by placing PEO memristors where they would receive the most positive STDP.\nFigure 9: (a) Average synaptic weight, (b) average positive STDP, (c) average negative STDP per profile type for the MEM networks in the T-maze.\nFigure 10: Synapse strengths (a) after the first 50 time steps, (b) after finding the first reward zone, and (c) after adapting to find the second reward zone for the best MEM network in the T-maze.\nRSM networks generated highly fit behaviour via the ability to rapidly vary the network dynamics in three main ways: (1) to perform additional connection selection in-trial, for example, to switch a synapse to a given state and leave it there; (2) as (1) but varying the connectivity map of the network multiple times based on the sensory input; and (3) in the creation of weight oscillators in the network, whereby the firing on the neurons and switching of the synapses synchronised through time to generate appropriate output actions from a subgroup of neurons. In the third case, the input state was found to perturb both the firing pattern of the neurons and the weight-switching pattern of the synapses to generate, for example, turning actions when required. All other network types using STDP relied on numerous repeated events of a particular polarity to provide large increases in efficacy, whereas the RSM could switch back and forth multiple times in a short number of time steps—more expedient binary switching allows for output to be more quickly altered for a given input configuration. RSM networks experience a gradual increase in STDP throughout the lifetime of the network. Figures  11 (a) and 11 (b) show the behaviour of the best RSM network from each run through the first 500 time steps. The switching profile itself shows two peaks of activity, at time steps 90 and 400, which correspond to the approximate turning times to reach R1 and R2, respectively. The contribution to switching frequency per Sn is shown in Figure  11 (b)—we observe significant disparity between all Sn types in this regard (all p<.05). Lower Sn synapses represent more variable STDP profiles, as they have higher maximum switching frequencies.\nFigure 11: (a) Average switch frequency (left axis)/average synaptic weight (right axis), (b) average switch frequency per Sn for the RSM networks in the T-maze.\nFewer overall STDP events occur in RSM networks than in MEM networks, presumably because (1) consecutive STDP events are more difficult to attain, and (2) each switch can have a more dramatic effect on the activity of the network. These results suggest that the casting of synapses into roles is only possible when using memristors as synapses, as RSM synapses do not display these relative disparities between Sn types, or a sensitivity to incoming voltage polarity.\n5  Conclusions\nSection:\nIn this study, we have introduced the notion of a variable RM and analysed its synaptic performance when compared to static RMs and benchmark connections in a dynamic robotics scenario. Our hypothesis was that the additional degrees of functional freedom afforded to the variable RMs allowed them to outperform these other synapses in key areas. Experimental findings supported this hypothesis, as variable RMs of both kinds generated higher quality solutions than the other synapse types.\nThe results suggest that self-adapation of the characteristic resistance profile of both variable RMs is harnessed by the evolutionary process to provide variable plastic networks with more implicit degrees of freedom than the other network types. Importantly, the need to explore additional search space (especially in the case of\n) was found to be nondisruptive (and in most cases beneficial) with respect to network performance, while providing a more flexible synaptic representation.\nThe inclusion of self-adaptive mutation parameters with a neuro-evolutionary approach is likely to be necessary for the autonomous emergence of neuromorphic processing units. This study presents a candidate implementation that allows for the formation of such task-specific neural groupings. Futhermore, our results enforce the view that this kind of approach may be used to guide the synthesis requirements of functional memristor/RSM hardware systems. Trials on different task types may provide insight into the optimal composition of such systems on a per-task basis.\nThe main benefit of RM STDP over other STDP implementations lies in hardware realisation, as the efficacy (and, in the case of the memristor, activity) of the synapse is stored in the nonvolatile physical state of the device and thus does not require simulation. Possible future research directions include hardware and mixed-media implementations, provided the two RM types can be integrated into the same circuit architecture. It is postulated that RSMs would be easier to implement in hardware due to their mechanically simpler discrete switching behaviours, which would require less finely-tuned manufacturing and be more tolerant of errors during this process. For synapses implementing approximately the same behaviour, it is likely that the same materials could be used, with finely controlled variations during synthesis required to achieve the desired behaviours. Where synapses require radically different functionality, mixing of heterogeneous materials may be required—considering the recent discovery of myriad memristors with varied behaviour at similar scales, it is likely that any evolved network will have a compatible behavioural hardware equivalent. We note that titanium dioxide additionally allows for memristive behaviour and binary switching to be elicited from the same material. As well as providing more functional degrees of freedom to the synapse, evolution could potentially control switching between the behaviours to autonomously create task-optimal neuromorphic subarchitectures, as well as online synaptic transformations via targeted irradiation for self-repair or self-modification.\nReferences\nSection:\nAbbott, L., and Regehr, W.

Examples of current IoT deployments across a range of sectors are presented. This paper also explores some of the social issues surrounding the IoT where security and privacy concerns are inhibiting the diffusion of IoT products and services and where much work needs to be done if end-users are to accept this new technology. Driving the development of IoT technologies is the demand for data and the potential for a revolution in how we understand our environments through the embedding of sensors and computational intelligence in everyday objects.

Starting from some initial conditions, they respond to environmental changes, and continuously improve their capabilities. Developmental psychologists have dedicated significant effort to studying the developmental progression of infant imitation skills, because imitation underlies the infant's ability to understand and learn from his or her social environment. In a converging intellectual endeavour, roboticists have been equipping robots with the ability to observe and imitate human actions because such abilities can lead to rapid teaching of robots to perform tasks. We provide here a comparative analysis between studies of infants imitating and learning from human demonstrators, and computational experiments aimed at equipping a robot with such abilities. We will compare the research across the following two dimensions: (a) initial conditions—what is innate in infants, and what functionality is initially given to robots, and (b) developmental mechanisms—how does the performance of infants improve over time, and what mechanisms are given to robots to achieve equivalent behaviour. Both developmental science and robotics are critically concerned with: (a) how their systems can and do go ‘beyond the stimulus’ given during the demonstration, and (b) how the internal models used in this process are acquired during the lifetime of the system.

Research indicates that complexity is the prime determinant of the air traffic controller's workload. Research has attempted to define and classify complexity variables that have been used to assess the capacity of en route airspace in Europe and North America. Such variables can also be used to assist in ATC sector design by highlighting those complexity factors that can lead to high workload and potentially risky scenarios for the controller. With the use of a structured interview technique, a study analyzed these ATC complexity variables for their impact on controller workload and safety. Seventy-nine air traffic controllers were interviewed about the factors that affected their workload. These controllers were based in 14 area control centers in Europe, including those of high complexity, such as Maastricht, Netherlands, as well as in nine centers in Asia, one in Africa, and Mumbai, India, a region with major traffic growth in recent years. On the basis of these interviews, a taxonomy of more than 50 complexity variables subdivided into 11 major groupings, such as traffic mix and entry and exit points, has been developed. In addition to rating of the impact of the individual complexity factors to assess their effect on airspace, interactions between complexity variables were deduced from the interviews. These interactions enable assessment of the factors that add to layers of complexity for controllers. Such a taxonomy can assist airspace planners in designing sectors that avoid complex ATC situations. How the impact of such complexity factors can be investigated in sector design is outlined.\n< >\nTransportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board\nTransportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board\nPrint ISSN: 0361-1981\n""","1.0","""http://trrjournalonline.trb.org/doi/10.3141/2007-09""","[-0.178219,51.500505]"

"""Cranfield_University""","""Real-time optimal techniques for unmanned air vehicles fuel savingProceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering - N Akhtar, J F Whidborne, A K Cooke, 2012""","""Download in PowerPoint\nFig. 1 Trajectory of a bird executing a dynamic soaring cycle in wind shear\nIt is also known that steady-state cruise is not necessarily optimal [ 2 , 3 ], subsequently the fuel economy can be improved by a sinusoidal perturbation away from steady-state cruise [ 4 ]. The reason that sinusoidal cruise is more efficient is because the flight condition for the best aerodynamic efficiency is not usually coincident with the flight condition for the best propulsion efficiency [ 5 ].\nThere is a need for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to increase endurance and/or reduce the amount of fuel carried. This article investigates dynamic soaring for an unmanned powered sailplane. The problem is to determine the trajectory required to maximize (in some sense) the fuel saving. This can be formulated as an optimal control problem. However, in order to implement such a technique in practice, the solution must be obtained fairly rapidly. Hence, the use of a particular direct method, sometime known as the inverse dynamics in the virtual domain (IDVD) method, which has been shown [ 6 ] to be suitable for practical real-time operation, is proposed.\nAutonomous soaring flight has been investigated previously: in fact, the first attempt to analyse the problem of albatross flight was made by Lord Rayleigh in 1883 [ 7 ]. More recently, Kiceniuk [ 8 ] proposed some heuristic techniques for the soaring trajectory, but Wharington [ 9 ] concluded that it is very hard to obtain useful trajectories for autonomous soaring with this approach and recommended using optimal control methods.\nBoslough [ 10 ] proposed solving the problem using genetic algorithms. Wharington [ 11 ] used a simulated annealing method for parameter search. The optimization procedure was found to be fast enough for off-line implementation, but such methods are generally regarded as being unsuitable for real-time applications.\nSachs and da Costa [ 12 ] considered optimizing trajectories for ridge soaring. The trajectories were constrained to follow an oval path, thus restricting the solution space. Similarly, Deittert et al. [ 13 ] constrained the vehicle to fly a circular path, an even more restrictive constraint. However, both strategies give very promising results.\nZhao [ 14 , 15 ] was probably the first to provide a promising method for real-time implementation. The optimal control problems were converted into parameter optimization with a collocation method and solved numerically using standard non-linear optimization software. However, no indication of the efficiency of the methods is provided. The approach proposed in this article draws on Zhao in the modelling and problem formulation.\nDeittert et al. [ 16 ] used a generic 3-m wing span UAV to study the impact of atmospheric turbulence on its dynamic soaring flight. He limited the soaring flights to stationary trajectories only. The use of a small amount of power resulted in an increased soaring time and mentioned a need to manage vehicle's energy rather than minimizing tracking errors.\nBoth Akhtar et al. [ 17 ] and Deittert et al. [ 18 ] have proposed using the differential flatness property of the aircraft dynamics. The idea is to find a closed form of the system's inverse dynamics based on a new set of outputs. Numerical integration of the equation of the motion is also avoided. Deittert et al. [ 18 ] used an albatross model to investigate the influence of maximum bank angle, minimum trajectory height, maximum airspeed, maximum lift coefficient, and mass on the minimal and maximal wind conditions required using closed trajectories.\nSinusoidal and periodic cruise trajectories have been investigated by a number of researchers, see [ 3 ] for a review of some of these. In periodic flight, the aircraft can glide at the best aerodynamic efficiency during power-off flight and boost at the best propulsion efficiency during power-on flight. An aircraft during steady-state flight cannot fly at maximum aerodynamic efficiency and propulsion efficiency simultaneously. Hence, some switching between these states is required.\nRecently, Menon and Sweriduk [ 19 ] investigated a near-optimal periodic solution to the maximum endurance cruise problem. Energy state methods were used to find a minimum fuel climb and maximum endurance descent trajectories. Point mass models of the F/A-18 and F-4 were used. A trajectory tracker was designed to track the cruise trajectories. Fuel savings of 17 per cent were achieved for the F/A-18 aircraft model if the engine was allowed to be turned off when the aircraft was not climbing. A modest saving of 2.7 per cent was achieved in periodic cruise with idealized engine characteristics and non-zero minimum throttle for F-4 aircraft model. Sachs and Christodoulou [ 20 , 21 ], showed using a point mass model and the multiple shooting method, that the maximum time-aloft for a given fuel can be increased by 50 per cent.\nMoster [ 22 ] carried out the analysis of oscillatory trajectories using NASA's Dual Study Vehicle DF-7 that was designed for Mach 10 global reach missions. It was concluded that operational complexity of turning engines on and off during each cycle make it undesirable for lifting body configurations optimized for hypersonic cruise. In reference [ 5 ], an aircraft was constrained to fly on the surface of a vertical cylinder. An example showed that a subsonic aircraft with maximal lift-to-drag ratio of 17.4 and thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.5, the endurance by optimal flight can be increased over three times.\nThe IDVD method is used here to solve the optimal control problem. This is a direct method that uses the inverse dynamics of a point-mass model of the aircraft to perform a search in the output space to obtain optimal trajectories that satisfy the constraints on the states and controls. This article extends results initially presented in reference [ 23 ]. Results for a small aircraft were also presented in reference [ 17 ]. The initial and final conditions enforce the dynamic soaring pattern, while the constraints on flight path angle, bank angle, thrust, and airspeed are enforced. The initial and final jerks (derivatives of acceleration) are used as the search parameters. A virtual arc is used to decouple the speed profile from the spatial paths. Polynomials are used to define the spatial trajectories and the speed, and their coefficients are determined analytically from the known boundary conditions, initial and final jerks and the soaring cycle time. The resulting non-linear programming problem is solved using the MATLAB fmincon function. The parameterization uses a finite degree polynomial, and the search is conducted over a subset of all possible trajectories resulting in suboptimal solutions.\nThe point mass and the wind gradient models are based on those from Zhao [ 15 ]. The equations of motion are normalized using a wind-conditioning parameter that represents the combined effect of atmospheric density, wing loading, and wind gradient slope. Two modes of operation are considered – travelling and loitering. In the first mode, the aircraft is required to travel a distance in the horizontal direction during each cycle. In the second mode, the sailplane is required to return to its initial state at the end of the cycle. The cost function is taken as the total power over a cycle. Since the final position of the cycle in the travelling modes is defined, this cost function also measures the total power required to travel a fixed distance.\nThe resulting optimal trajectories are verified using a six-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) model of a high-performance powered sailplane [ 24 ]. A controller [ 25 ] was designed to track the trajectories generated by the optimization routine. Like Zhao [ 14 , 15 ], the proposed method requires a priori knowledge of the wind shear characteristics. A method to estimate these is also proposed and tested in simulation.\n2 DYNAMIC SOARING MODEL\nSection:\n2.1 Wind profile model\nTypically, reasonably stable atmospheric conditions exist close to the ocean surface with the wind velocity nearly zero at the surface and increasing gradually with altitude.

The establishment and maintenance of epigenetic gene marks is fundamental to the regulation of gene transcription and the control of cell function. RIP140 is a corepressor for nuclear receptors that suppresses transcription from a broad programme of metabolic genes and thereby controls energy homoeostasis in vivo. Here we show by analysis of Ucp1, a gene which is typically expressed in brown but not white adipocytes, that RIP140 is essential for both DNA and histone methylation to maintain gene repression. RIP140 expression promotes the assembly of DNA and histone methyltransferases (HMTs) on the Ucp1 enhancer and leads to methylation of specific CpG residues and histones as judged by bisulphite genomic sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Our results suggest that RIP140 serves as a scaffold for both DNA and HMT activities to inhibit gene transcription by two key epigenetic repression systems.\nUcp1\nIntroduction\nNuclear receptors are ligand‐activated transcription factors that regulate a vast array of biological processes by modulating expression of specific target genes ( Yamamoto, 1985 ; McKenna and O'Malley, 2002a ). Their ability to stimulate transcription depends on the recruitment of cofactors that remodel chromatin and the assembly of the basal transcription machinery ( Dilworth and Chambon, 2001 ; Rosenfeld et al, 2006 ). Chromatin remodelling is achieved by enzymes that catalyse post‐translational modifications of histones and the shuttling of nucleosomes by ATP‐dependent mechanisms. The histone modifications, which include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, sumoylation, deimination, ADP ribosylation and proline isomerization, lead to alterations in the accessibility of chromatin and allow for regulated transcription of genes ( Kouzarides, 2007 ). These modifications which may take place sequentially or in combination are proposed to constitute a ‘histone code’ ( Strahl and Allis, 2000 ; Turner, 2000 ; Jenuwein and Allis, 2001 ) that dictates the transcription state of genes. In addition to histone modifications, DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism for gene silencing ( Bird and Wolffe, 1999 ). Methylation at cytosine residues of the dinucleotide sequence CpG is essential for animal development ( Bird, 2002 ) and irregular methylation patterns lead to cancer ( Yoo and Jones, 2006 ).\nThe diverse biological processes regulated by nuclear receptors are attributed to differential recruitment of coactivators and corepressors that function as scaffolds for the recruitment of chromatin remodelling enzymes. In the absence of ligand, certain nuclear receptors recruit corepressors such as SMRT and N‐CoR that bind repressive enzymes such as histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs) ( Jepsen and Rosenfeld, 2002 ) or the histone methyltransferase (HMT) SUV39H1, which specifically methylates histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) ( Li et al, 2002 ). In the presence of a ligand, activated receptors recruit coactivators such as the histone acetyltransferases (HATs), HMTs, p160s and CBP/p300 as well as the arginine‐specific HMTs PRMT1 and CARM1 to promote gene transcription ( Bauer et al, 2002 ; McKenna and O'Malley, 2002b ; Stallcup et al, 2003 ). On the other hand, ligand bound nuclear receptors can also bind corepressors such as RIP140 ( Cavailles et al, 1995 ) and L‐CoR ( Fernandes et al, 2003 ) to actively repress gene expression.\nRIP140 is highly conserved in vertebrates and widely expressed in tissues. Analysis of mice devoid of the RIP140 gene indicates that the corepressor is essential for ovulation ( White et al, 2000 ) and energy homoeostasis ( Leonardsson et al, 2004 ). Thus, RIP140‐null mice accumulate markedly less fat in their adipose tissue, are resistant to high‐fat diet‐induced obesity and exhibit improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity ( Leonardsson et al, 2004 ; Christian et al, 2006 ; Powelka et al, 2006 ). These changes are associated with increased expression of metabolic genes in white adipose tissue (WAT) ( Leonardsson et al, 2004 ) and muscle ( Seth et al, 2007 ). Among the upregulated genes is uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) which is expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT) during adaptive thermogenesis but normally remains silenced in WAT. Further analysis of adipocyte cell lines indicates that RIP140 plays an intrinsic role in suppressing transcription from gene networks responsible for catabolism ( Christian et al, 2005 ; Powelka et al, 2006 ). The Ucp1 gene is stimulated by a number of nuclear receptors that bind to an enhancer region 2.3 kb upstream of the start site of transcription ( Kozak et al, 1994 ; Lowell and Spiegelman, 2000 ). We have shown previously that RIP140 is capable of binding to this enhancer and that this is necessary and sufficient to reduce Ucp1 gene expression ( Christian et al, 2005 ).\nRIP140 comprises four distinct repression domains ( Christian et al, 2004 ) that have been shown to bind HDACs ( Wei et al, 2000 ) and carboxy‐terminal‐binding protein (CtBP) ( Vo et al, 2001 ). CtBP has been shown to form a multisubunit protein complex that contains a number of chromatin‐modifying enzymes including HDACs, and the HMTs, G9a and EuHMT ( Shi et al, 2003 ). To investigate the mechanism by which RIP140 inhibits transcription, we have focused on the Ucp1 gene and analysed the ability of the corepressor to modify epigenetic marks around its promoter and upstream enhancer. We made use of adipocytes with and without RIP140 ( Christian et al, 2005 ) and investigated whether the corepressor was required to modify histone residues and whether it was involved in DNA methylation. By using in vitro DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) assays as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments, we show that the corepressor controls both DNA and histone methylation of the Ucp1 enhancer and promoter. Thus, RIP140 serves a role in controlling gene transcription by two key epigenetic repression systems.\nResults\nRIP140 associates with DNA and HMT activity\nIt has been shown previously that RIP140 inhibits transcription by means of distinct repression domains that function by HDAC‐dependent and ‐independent mechanisms ( Wei et al, 2000 ; Christian et al, 2004 ). In this study, we investigated a potential functional interaction between the corepressor and DNA and HMTs in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Proteins that bind to RIP140 in glutathione S‐transferase (GST) pull‐down experiments were assayed for DNA and HMT activity by determining the incorporation of [H3]S‐adenosyl‐l‐methionine (SAM) into unmethylated CG‐rich oligonucleotide templates or core histones, respectively. As shown in Figure 1A , GST‐RIP140 was able to purify Dnmt activity to a similar extent to that purified by GST‐G9a, a HMT that interacts with Dnmt1 ( Esteve et al, 2006 ). This indicates that the corepressor associates with endogenous DNA methylation activity. This association is specific and significant relative to the background activity purified by GST alone. On the other hand, GST‐RIP140 did not purify any HMT activity above the background of GST alone in contrast to GST‐CtBP ( Figure 1B ), a repressor that interacts with the HMTs G9a and EuHMT ( Shi et al, 2003 ) as well as with RIP140 ( Vo et al, 2001 ).\nDownload powerpoint\nFigure 6.\nBoth DNA methylation and histone deacetylation are required for RIP140 repression of the endogenous Ucp1 gene. +RIP140‐L cells were treated with 5‐aza‐dC, TSA and 5‐aza‐dC plus TSA. Ucp1 and ap2 expression was determined by real‐time PCR. Data were normalized to mitochondrial L19 levels and are expressed relative to vehicle treatments. The results are averages of at least three independent experiments with error bars indicating standard error of means (s.e.m.).\nDiscussion\nPrevious work has clearly established the importance of RIP140 as a corepressor for nuclear receptors and its role in inhibiting metabolic gene expression ( Leonardsson et al, 2004 ; Christian et al, 2005 ; Powelka et al, 2006 ; Debevec et al, 2007 ; Seth et al, 2007 ). In this study, we demonstrate that RIP140 targets repressive histone‐modifying and DNA methylation activity to the Ucp1 enhancer to silence gene expression. RIP140 expression in RIP140‐null adipocytes leads to an increase in methylation of histone tails at H3‐K9 and H3‐K27 and CpG dinucleotides in the enhancer/promoter of this gene. Thus it appears that RIP140 provides a scaffold for the assembly of both histone and DNA‐modifying enzymes, thereby providing a mechanistic link between two key epigenetic repression systems to regulate Ucp1 gene expression in adipocytes.\nUcp1 is expressed in BAT during adaptive thermogenesis ( Lowell and Spiegelman, 2000 ), but normally remains silenced in WAT. We have recently demonstrated that the nuclear receptors PPARα, PPARγ and ERRα are responsible for the upregulated Ucp1 expression observed in RIP140‐null adipocytes by binding to an upstream enhancer element ( Debevec et al, 2007 ). RIP140 is also recruited to this enhancer which is both necessary and sufficient to mediate repression of the Ucp1 gene in adipocytes ( Christian et al, 2005 ; Debevec et al, 2007 ). Characterization of autonomous repression domains (RDs) within RIP140 indicate that they function by HDAC‐dependent and ‐independent mechanisms ( Christian et al, 2004 ). RD1 has been shown to bind HDACs 1 and 3 ( Wei et al, 2000 ) and we have shown here that it may also function by recruiting Dnmts. RD2 binds directly to CtBP ( Vo et al, 2001 ; Christian et al, 2004 ), which forms a multiprotein repressive complex with HDACs and HMTs ( Shi et al, 2003 ). RD3 together with RD4 also seem to recruit DNA methylation activity to the corepressor. Thus, it appears that RIP140 facilitates the binding of a host of repressive enzymes including HDAC1, HDAC3, CtBP, G9, Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a/3b to the Ucp1 enhancer leading to modification of histones and DNA to prevent gene transcription. It is conceivable that the binding of these enzymes is an indirect consequence of other repressive mechanisms, but we favour a central role for RIP140 for the following reasons: repression of Ucp1 expression is entirely dependent on RIP140, while the upstream enhancer which binds RIP140 is necessary and sufficient to mediate the repression ( Christian et al, 2005 ); the recruitment of repressive enzymes to the enhancer occurs only following RIP140 expression; RIP140 interacts directly with HDACs, CtBP and Dnmts; Re‐ChIP experiments demonstrate the simultaneous presence of RIP140, CtBP and Dnmts at the Ucp1 enhancer and importantly RIP140 purifies DNA methylation activity to methylate DNA templates in vitro. It is noteworthy that Dnmts have been shown to be targeted to promoters via their association with sequence‐specific binding proteins such as Rb, E2F1 and RP58 ( Robertson et al, 2000 ; Fuks et al, 2001 ). We propose that RIP140 functions in a similar manner to target the Dnmts, HDACs, CtBP and G9a to the Ucp1 enhancer element to induce silencing of the gene.\nDNA methylation, histone deacetylation, H3K9 and H3K27 methylation typically coincide in heterochromatin and silent gene promoters ( Bird, 2001 ; Fuks, 2005 ). The deposition of H3K9 methylation by G9a at the Ucp1 enhancer may lead to repression via a number of mechanisms. Both di‐ and tri‐H3K9‐methylated peptides form binding sites for HP1 that associates with other repressors including HDACs and RNAs that silence gene expression. This mechanism has been shown to be important in both heterochromatin formation and transcriptional repression ( Nielsen et al, 2001 ; Kouzarides, 2002 ). However, H3K9 methylation and HP1 do not completely colocalize and H3K9me is also sufficient to suppress transcription independent of HP1, through mechanisms involving histone deacetylation ( Stewart et al, 2005 ) and by inhibiting phosphorylation of H3S10 ( Cheung et al, 2000 ).\nH3K27 methylation is catalysed by the enzymatic activity of the PcG protein EZH2 ( Cao et al, 2002 ; Kuzmichev et al, 2002 ). This subsequently leads to repression by facilitating the binding of additional PRC2 and PRC1 repressive PcG multiprotein complexes. Interestingly, Bracken et al (2006) have recently identified Ucp1 as a PcG target gene in human embryonic fibroblasts. In their study, the Ucp1 promoter showed strong enrichments for the PcG proteins SUZ12, CBX8 and H3K27me3, while depletion of EZH2 resulted in a significant upregulation of Ucp1 expression. Therefore, the RIP140‐dependent induction of H3K27 trimethylation at the Ucp1 enhancer and promoter may be mediated by the enzymatic activity of EZH2. EZH2 has been shown to interact directly with Dnmts and is necessary but not sufficient for de novo DNA methylation of PcG‐repressed genes ( Vire et al, 2006 ). Moreover, although EZH2‐mediated H3K27 methylation pre‐marks genes for silencing in cancer, additional factors are required to promote de novo DNA methylation ( Schlesinger et al, 2007 ). Our finding that the recruitment of Dnmts for the repression of Ucp1 is dependent on RIP140, and that H3K27me3 is increased by RIP140 expression suggests that the corepressor may function as a trigger for EZH2 activation.\nWe have demonstrated that the RIP140‐mediated recruitment of Dnmts leads to a striking increase in DNA methylation at the enhancer and proximal promoter. One mechanism by which DNA methylation is proposed to repress gene expression involves interference with the binding of transcription factors ( Bird and Wolffe, 1999 ). At least two CpG dinucleotides methylated in RIP140‐expressing adipocytes overlap functional binding sites for the cAMP‐response element‐binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor implicated in Ucp1 regulation ( Rim and Kozak, 2002 ). In particular, cAMP response elements CRE2 and CRE4 (indicated by arrows in Figure 4 ) bind phosphorylated CREB. A recent genome‐wide analysis of CREB promoter occupancy has clearly demonstrated that DNA methylation of CREB response elements is inhibitory to the binding of this transcription factor ( Zhang et al, 2005 ). Our results support the notion that RIP140 might suppress Ucp1 expression by methylation of CREs. It is noteworthy that the methylation levels of these CpGs are significantly higher in WAT than in BAT of wild‐type mice, while this difference is less prominent in RIP140‐null mice in which there is Ucp1 expression in WAT (data not shown).\nAdipose genes that are subject to repression by RIP140 fall into two groups. One group comprises genes such as Ucp1 that are generally inactive in WAT but can be derepressed in the absence of RIP140. The ability of RIP140 to direct repressive histone modifications and DNA methylation provides a mechanism for silencing Ucp1 and similar genes in WAT that are normally only expressed in BAT. It appears therefore that RIP140 plays a developmental role by epigenetically silencing a subset of genes during adipogenesis that are involved in energy expenditure in brown adipocytes and thereby ensuring that they are not expressed in white adipocytes. On the other hand, the majority of genes repressed by RIP140 are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation and expressed in both brown and white adipocytes. The mechanism by which RIP140 regulates the expression of this second group of target genes remains to be determined.\nTaken together, this study highlights a novel role for RIP140 in directing key epigenetic repression mechanisms, namely H3K9, H3K27 and DNA methylation for silencing of a PcG pre‐marked gene. These findings provide a mechanistic link between a hormonally regulated nuclear receptor corepressor and essential epigenetic mechanisms. These results also provide an insight into the mechanism of tissue‐specific regulation of Ucp1 and underlie a developmental role for RIP140 in determining the metabolic profile and function of adipose tissue by epigenetically marking relevant genes or gene networks.\nMaterials and methods\nCell culture\nThe generation, maintenance and adipocyte differentiation of RIP140−/− and +RIP140‐L mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have been previously described ( Christian et al, 2005 ). All cells were differentiated in the presence of 2.5 μM rosiglitazone.\n5Aza‐dC and TSA treatments of cells\nFor 5Aza‐dC treatments, cells were allowed to reach confluence and given 5‐Aza‐2′‐deoxycytidine (5Aza‐dC; Sigma) (0.5 μM), (1 μM) or DMSO (vehicle) for 48 h changing every 24 h. Then, cells were differentiated into adipocytes for 10 days before RNA was isolated. For Trichostatin A (TSA; Sigma) treatments, cells were differentiated for 8 days and then treated with TSA (1 μM) or DMSO (vehicle) for 48 h changing every 24 h. For combinational treatments, cells were treated for 48 h with 5Aza‐dC (0.5 μM) and differentiated for 8 days as before, followed by 48 h of TSA treatments.\nExpression analysis\nTotal RNA from cell lines was extracted using TRIZOL (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and cDNA preparation was performed as described previously ( Christian et al, 2005 ). Expression levels for all genes were correlated to the ribosomal coding gene L19. Primer sequences are available on request. Affymetrix gene expression profiling and data analysis have been previously described ( Christian et al, 2005 ).\nChromatin immunoprecipitation assay\nChromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed as described previously ( Christian et al, 2005 ). Cells were treated with Rosiglitazone and insulin for 30 min and then incubated in the protein–protein crosslinking reagent dimethyl adipimidate 2 HCl (Pierce) at 10 mM in DMEM for 30 min followed by 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 37°C. The crosslinked cells were lysed, sonicated and immunoprecipitated with Protein A/G PLUS‐agarose (Santa Cruz) according to the manufacturer's instructions using the following antibodies: AcH3 (06‐599), AcH4 (06‐866), H3K9‐me2 (07‐441), H3K27‐me2 (07‐421), H3K27‐me3 (07‐449), G9a (07‐551) (all Upstate), H3K4‐me2 (ab7766), H3K9‐me3 (ab8898), HDAC1 (ab7028), HDAC3 (ab2379), Dnmt3a (ab13888), Dnmt3b (ab2851) (all Abcam), CtBP (sc‐11390), Dnmt1 (sc‐20701) (both Santa Cruz) and RIP140 (a kind gift from Hongwu Chen). DNA fragments were purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and enrichment relative to input was determined by quantitative PCR. End point PCR was used for representative gel pictures. All quantitative PCR reactions were carried out in duplicates, averaged and expressed relative to the input signal. Primer sequences for quantitative PCR and end point PCR are available on request. For the sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation (Re‐ChIP) assay, chromatin was eluted with DTT (10 mM) from the first antibody–protein A/G PLUS–agarose complex.\nBisulphite sequencing\nBisulphite genomic sequencing was performed as described previously ( Monk et al, 2003 ). Approximately 0.6 μg of DNA in a volume of 32.5 μl was denatured by the addition of 1.1 μl NaOH 10 N for 15 min at 50°C. For bisulphite treatment, 200 μl of approximately 4 M sodium bisulphite, pH 5.0 (Sigma; final concentration 3.5 M), 1.5 μl 75 mM hydroquinone (Sigma, final concentration 0.5 mM), 5 μg glycogen were added and the mixture was incubated for 4 h at 55°C. Desalting was carried out using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and the eluted DNA (in 50 μl Tris–Cl, pH 7.5) was desulphonated by treatment with 1.6 μl NaOH 10 N. DNA was ethanol‐precipitated, resuspended in H2O, and HotStar DNA polymerase (Qiagen) was used to PCR‐amplify CpG island products (annealing temperature of 58°C)‐specific primers. The amplified products were either digested with the methylation‐sensitive restriction endonuclease TaqI or cloned into a TOPO vector and sequenced. The efficiency of C‐U conversion in the samples used was determined to be >95%. Primer sequences may be obtained on request.\nGST pull‐down assays\nDnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b and G9a were in vitro transcribed–translated from pcDNA3‐Myc‐Dnmt1, pcDNA3‐Myc‐Dnmt3a, pcDNA3‐Myc‐Dnmt3b (a kind gift from F Fuks) and Bluescript SK‐G9a (a kind gift from Y Shinkai) using the TNT system (Promega). GST and GST‐fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 using the pGEX vector system (Pharmacia) and protein was purified from crude bacterial lysates according to the manufacturer's instructions and in the presence of Benzonase (Novagen). GST pull‐down assays were carried out essentially as previously described ( Christian et al, 2004 ). Input 10% corresponds to 10% of the IVT product used in the reaction.\nDNA and HMT assays\nDNA and HMT methyltransferase assays were essentially carried out as described previously ( Fuks et al, 2000 ; Shi et al, 2003 ). GST and GST fusions were expressed and purified (see GST pull‐down assays above), incubated with HeLa nuclear extract overnight at 4°C and the resulting complexes were then tested for in vitro methyltransferase activity. Similarly, a RIP140‐specific antibody (P17A6) (see Antibody generation below) or IgG‐conjugated agarose beads (PIERCE) were incubated with HeLa, RIP140−/− and CtBP−/− nuclear extracts for 4 h, at 4°C and the resulting complexes were then tested for in vitro methyltransferase activity. In vitro Dnmt activity was assayed in 100 μl reactions containing 1 μg of a 33 bp oligonucleotide ( Ramchandani et al, 1997 ), 2 μl [H3]S‐adenosyl‐l‐methionine (81 Ci/mmol; Amersham), 40 μl 50% glycerol, Tris–HCl (50 mM, pH 7.5), EDTA (5 mM), DTT (5 mM), protease inhibitors and incubated at 37°C for 1 h with shaking. In vitro HMT activity was assayed in 50 μl reactions containing core histones (Upstate), 1.6 μl [H3]S‐adenosyl‐l‐methionine (81 Ci/mmol; Amersham), DTT (5 mM) and protease inhibitors and incubated at 37°C for 1.5 h with shaking. After the reactions, DNA and histones were TCA‐precipitated in filter paper and unincorporated nuclides removed by sequential washing with 2 × 10% TCA, 2 × 5% TCA and pure ethanol. Incorporation of radioactive methyl groups was determined by liquid scintillation counting.\nCo‐immunoprecipitation and western blot\nCo‐immunoprecipitations were carried out essentially as described previously ( Herzog et al, 2007 ). For co‐immunoprecipitation of endogenous Dnmt1, 1.5 mg of HeLa cell nuclear extract was incubated with 35 μl anti‐RIP140 (P17A6) or anti‐IgG‐conjugated agarose beads (PIERCE), while whole‐cell extracts of transfected HeLa cells with 145 ng of pcDNA3‐Myc‐Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b were used similarly to precipitate Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. The following antibodies were used for subsequent western blots of immunoprecipitated proteins, Dnmt1 (ab13537), Dnmt3a (ab23565) and Dnmt3b (ab16049) all by Abcam.\nAdenovirus infection and siRNA treatment\nAdenoviral vectors expressing siRNA for RIP140 and siRandom have been described previously ( Herzog et al, 2007 ). HeLa cells were infected at an MOI of 40 for 1 h before nuclear extracts were prepared. The effect of the siRNA was confirmed by western blot using a RIP140 antibody (6D7) ( Herzog et al, 2007 ) and RNA pol II (sc‐899, Santa Cruz).\nAntibody generation\ncDNA encoding amino acids 599–700 of human RIP140 protein was inserted into the pGEX6 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant protein was expressed and purified from the E. coli strain BL21 according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Biosciences). Young Balb/c × B6 F1 crossed mice were immunized by subcutaneous injection with 50 μg of fusion protein emulsified with an equal volume of Titremax Gold (CytRx Corporation). The immunization was repeated three times at 1 monthly intervals, then the mice were rested for 6 months. A further 100 μg of fusion protein in phosphate‐buffered saline was injected intraperitoneally at 6 and 3 days prior to killing. Hybridoma lines were then established by fusing splenocytes from the immunized animal with the myeloma line Sp2/0‐Ag14 by polyethylene glycol treatment using conventional procedures ( Harlow and Lane, 1988 ). Individual wells were screened for antibody production by a modified dot blot procedure using bacterially expressed fusion protein ( Dilworth and Horner, 1993 ), and single cell cloned a minimum of three times before being grown for antibody isolation. Each monoclonal antibody was screened for specificity by western blotting against total proteins from SDS‐derived tissue culture cell lysates. Line (P17A6) was found to be specific for RIP140 (data not shown) in mouse cell lysates.\nSupplementary data\nSupplementary data are available at The EMBO Journal Online ( http://www.embojournal.org ).\nSupplementary Information\nSupplementary Figure S4 [emboj7601908-sup-0004.pdf]\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Y Shinkai for Bluescript SK‐G9a, F Fuks for pcDNA3‐Myc‐Dnmt1/3a and 3b.

In our previous research, we have used the recursive least square error minimization method to determine the vehicle's pose information. When a reasonably precise initial estimate is used, our system will converge to the vehicle's pose parameters with high accuracy. Using the global positioning system (GPS), we can obtain a position estimate with errors which, in normal conditions, are of the order of 100 meters. This accuracy is not sufficient for automated navigation. The initial estimate taken from the GPS system can be refined and improved by using curvature matching. Comparing the expected and calculated 3D road curvature, the system can recognize the current position on the road. Curvature in the 3D space is determined by selecting and backprojecting points from a 2D road image and fitting a set of cubic spline patches to them. At present the system has been tested using both synthetic data and real data. The initial results indicate that the method can be made to work well, however, care is required in the measurement and calculation of the curvature in real applications.\n© (1995) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Autonomous power line inspection using small UAVs, has been the focus of many research works over the past couple of decades. Automatic detection of power pylons is a primary requirement to achieve such autonomous systems. It is still a challenging task due to the complex geometry and cluttered background of these structures.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe identification solution proposed, avoids the complexity of classic object recognition techniques. Instead of searching the whole image for the pylon template, low-level geometric priors with robust colour attributes are combined to remove the pylon background. The depth estimation, on the other hand, is based on a new concept which exploits the ego-motion of the inspection UAV to estimate its distance from the pylon using just a monocular camera.\nFindings\nAn algorithm is tested on a quadrotor UAV, using different kinds of metallic power pylons. Both simulation and real-world experiments, conducted in different backgrounds and illumination conditions, show very promising results.\nResearch limitations/implications\nIn the real tests carried out, the Inertial Navigation System (INS) of the vehicle was used to estimate its ego-motion. A more reliable solution should be considered for longer distances, by either fusing INS and global positioning system data or using visual navigation techniques such as visual odometry.\nOriginality/value\nA simple yet efficient solution is proposed that allows the UAV to reliably identify the pylon, with still a low processing cost. Considering a monocular solution is a major advantage, given the limited payload and processing power of such small vehicles.\nKeywords:\n""","0.31267565","""http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/IR-11-2014-0419""","[-0.629225,52.074389]"

These included two different DOX treatments: an acute in vitro administration to primary isolated adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (ARVCMs) and an in vivo model of DOX-induced HF ( Supplementary Figures 2 and 3 ), created by serial injections of the drug as previously described. 27 An in vivo model of myocardial infarction (MI) was generated by proximal left anterior descendent (LAD) coronary artery ligation leading to pathological hypertrophy at 4 weeks and HF by 16–20 weeks and was included as reference of severe cardiomyopathy. 28 A total of 26 miRNAs had significantly altered expression by ≥1.5-folds in DOX-treated cultured ARVCMs, 18 miRNAs in ARVCMs obtained from DOX-treated hearts and 40 miRNAs were dysregulated in ARVCM from infarcted hearts 4 weeks post MI. Seven miRNAs (miR-133b, miR-143, miR-210, miR-29c, miR-30d, miR-30e and miR-345-5p) were found to be downregulated in all three models ( Figure 1 ). A subset of three overlapping hits (miR-30e, miR-210 and miR-29c) was chosen for validation by reverse transcription–quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR; Supplementary Figure 4 ). Moreover, sustained miRNA alteration during HF progression was confirmed by RT-qPCR at a later time of 16–20 weeks post MI stage ( Supplementary Figure 5 ). We could also confirm aberrant expression of several miRNAs that had previously linked to heart disease in our models ( Figure 1b , bold writing). 21 , 22 , 25 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 Strikingly, three members of the miR-30 family (miR-30a, miR-30d and miR-30e) were downregulated in at least two models, which indicated potential biological relevance. miR-30e showed the greatest dysregulation across all three models of study ( Figure 1c ).\nFull figure and legend (239 K )\nDOX induces β 1AR, β 2AR, Giα-2 and BNIP3L/NIX expression through miR-30 downregulation\nTo further investigate the implication of miR-30 in DOX-induced myocardial damage, we used TargetScan software and retrieved a list of highly conserved predicted miR-30 target genes, based on seed pairing. Given that all family members share the same seed sequence, they are predicted to target the same genes. 36 Pathway enrichment analysis of putative miR-30 targets using Database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery ( http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/ ) revealed an implication of this target list in cardiovascular disease, being 3 out of the 10 most significantly enriched pathways related to cardiomyopathy ( Figure 2a ). Among the predicted miR-30 targets, we focused on four genes, which were identified as part of an interacting network by Cytoscape ( Supplementary Figure 7 ) and thus considered high-confidence predictions. Three of these genes are involved in the β-adrenergic pathway: β1AR, β2AR and Giα-2. The fourth target selected was the BCL2/adenovirus E1B-interacting protein 3-like (BNIP3L or NIX), an important apoptotic effector capable of mediating mitochondrial death and triggering myocardial disease 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 ( Figure 2b ).\nFull figure and legend (154 K )\nAll four targets were first validated by luciferase assays using vectors containing the respective target 3’UTR downstream of the luciferase reporter gene (see Methods). Mutated versions of the 3’UTR sequences with disrupted miR-30-binding sites were also assayed to confirm specific miRNA–3’UTR interaction and the non-target programed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) was included as additional negative control (NC). As cellular platform, we used H9c2 cardiac muscle cell line, which retains numerous features of mature cardiomyocytes and have been previously used to investigate DOX cardiotoxicity 41 , 42 ( Supplementary Figure 6 ). A significant reduction in luciferase activity was recorded for all four predicted targets when co-transfecting with the corresponding 3’UTR vector and the miR-30e mimic (pre-30e) as representative of the family, compared with pre-NC. Conversely, as expected, no changes were observed when co-transfected with the mutated 3’UTR versions and for PDCD4 ( Figure 2c ). Overall, we demonstrated direct regulation of these four genes by miR-30.\nWe next overexpressed miR-30e in H9c2 cardiac cultures and observed a decrease in target mRNA levels of the selected targets ( Figure 3a ). We quantified protein dysregulation of BNIP3L and Giα-2 by western blotting ( Figure 3b ) but this was not possible for β1AR and β2AR as there were no specific antibodies commercially available. 43 , 44 To partly overcome this issue, accumulation of cAMP was used as an indicator of βAR signaling, which validated miR-30 targeting ( Figure 4a ). Additional confirmation of miR-30-dependent regulation of target genes was achieved by miR-30 inhibition using an in-house sponge vector designed inhibit the entire miR-30 family 45 ( Figure 3c ). In contrast to the results obtained upon miR-30e overexpression, increased target mRNA and protein levels were recorded ( Figures 3d and e ). These data were replicated independently using a commercial locked nucleic acid (LNA) construct for whole miR-30 family inhibition ( Supplementary Figures 8 and 9 ). Remarkably, DOX treatment of H9c2 cardiac cells triggered an increase in miR-30 target mRNA levels, which could be fully reversed by simultaneous overexpression of miR-30 ( Figure 3f ). This indicates that mechanistically DOX is able to induce miR-30 target expression through miR-30 downregulation. Interestingly, miR-30 target upregulation also occurred in vivo upon DOX treatment, which is consistent with the demonstrated miR-30 downregulation in this disease model ( Figure 3g ). Together, these data suggest that β1AR, β2AR, Giα-2 and BNIP3L/NIX are novel miR-30 targets and that the downregulation of miR-30 by DOX is responsible for the increase in target gene expression.\nFull figure and legend (91 K )\nmiR-30 expression attenuates the contractile response of cardiomyocytes to βAR stimulation\nmiRNAs can modulate the expression of hundreds of mRNAs and is the global regulatory effect on targets with opposing functions that will ultimately influence cellular phenotypes. After validating three members of the β-adrenergic pathway (β1AR, β2AR and Giα-2) as miR-30 targets, we evaluated the net effects of miR-30 dysregulation on this pathway. As mentioned, cAMP is a direct indicator of βAR activation while inversely correlates with Gi activity. We observed significantly increased cAMP generation upon acute DOX treatment, as well as following miR-30 inhibition with our pEGFP-sp30 vector. On the other hand, less cAMP accumulation was detected when overexpressing miR-30e in cardiac cultures ( Figure 4a ). These findings are consistent with the regulation of βARs by miR-30 and suggest that miR-30 exerts a greater inhibitory effect on βARs rather than Giα-2.\nHaving assessed the alterations that miR-30 expression modulation has on cellular cAMP, we wished to determine the global effects of miR-30 target regulation on cardiomyocyte contractility. We transfected primary isolated ARVCM with miR-30e mimics to achieve overexpression ( Supplementary Figure 10 ) and recorded single-cell contractility using IonOptix. No significant changes were observed in the baseline percentage of contraction amplitude ( Figure 4b ). We then stimulated transfected ARVCM with increasing concentrations of isoproterenol, a βAR agonist, and analyzed paced contractile responses. Cells overexpressing miR-30e showed decreased contractile response to isoproterenol compared with control cells ( Figure 4c ), a finding supported by the cAMP accumulation data.\nmiR-30 expression is protective against DOX toxicity\nIt is known that DOX induces cellular toxicity mediated by caspase-dependent apoptosis. 46 We investigated whether miR-30 expression modulation is sufficient to affect DOX-induced toxicity in cultured cardiac cells. We measured the activity of caspases 3 and 7 as apoptotic indicator. Ectopically increased miR-30e expression resulted in reduced apoptosis, bringing caspase activity closer to the levels observed upon vehicle treatment ( Figure 5a ). On the contrary, cultures presented higher caspase activity when inhibiting miR-30 with our pEGFP-sp30 sponge vector ( Figure 5a ).\nFull figure and legend (138 K )\nDOX has also been described to increase the expression of Bax (pro-apoptotic gene) and to decrease Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic gene) levels. Indeed, elevated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio increases susceptibility to death following apoptotic stimuli 47 and restored Bcl-2 expression has been shown to protect cardiomyocytes against DOX toxicity. 48 To further assess the protective effects of miR-30 against DOX insult, we measured the Bax/Bcl-2 expression ratio in treated cardiac cultures. As expected, DOX treatment progressively increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In contrast, miR-30e overexpression reduced the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio upon DOX treatment ( Figure 5b ). An additional characteristic of DOX-associated cardiomyocyte damage is high ROS levels. 49 We therefore assessed the impact of miR-30 on ROS. Notably, cells with high miR-30e expression showed reduced ROS, whereas miR-30 inhibition resulted in higher ROS levels. No further increase in ROS production was observed when combining DOX treatment and miR-30 inhibition ( Figure 5c ). This finding further confirmed the benefit of high miR-30 expression in cardiac cells.\nGATA-6 mediates DOX-induced miR-30 downregulation\nWe next wished to establish the mechanism via which DOX downregulates miR-30 expression. GATA-6 is a transcription factor highly expressed in the heart and known to play a key role in cardiac development. 50 Interestingly, we discovered evidence of GATA-6 binding to miR-30 cluster promoters by data mining of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing experiments, using deepBase ( http://deepbase.sysu.edu.cn/ ). Strikingly, we identified increased GATA-6 levels shortly (30 min–1 h) in primary isolated ARVCM after DOX treatment, accompanied by a sustained reduction in mature miR-30e expression from the 1 h time point ( Figure 6a ).\nFull figure and legend (140 K )\nWe silenced GATA-6 using RNA interference ( Supplementary Figure 12 ) and, in order to unveil the nature of its regulatory effect, we quantified primary and mature miR-30 levels of two family members coded in different clusters (miR-30d, miR-30e) by RT-qPCR. GATA-6 inhibition resulted in increased levels of miR-30d and miR-30e, at both the primary and mature stages of their bioprocessing ( Figure 6b ), suggesting an inhibitory role for GATA-6 on the miR-30 promoters. Subsequently, we measured expression levels of the validated miR-30 targets (β1AR, β2AR, Giα-2 and BNIP3L) upon GATA-6 silencing, which were accordingly reduced ( Figure 6c ). Decreased target expression levels could be compensated by simultaneous miR-30 family inhibition using LNA oligonucleotides ( Figure 6c ), suggesting a direct mediation of the GATA-6 effects on target gene expression by miR-30. Finally, in order to determine the impact of GATA-6 on cell toxicity, we measured caspase activity in treated H9c2 cardiac cultures. GATA-6 inhibition was reduced activation of apoptotic pathways even in the presence of DOX administration ( Figure 6d ).\nTop of page\nDiscussion\nWe describe here cardiomyocyte-specific alterations in miRNA expression following acute and chronic DOX injury, and post-MI induction. A shared miRNA subset was detected across the assayed models of cardiac toxicity, reflective of consistencies in the cardiomyocyte response to injury. However, those miRNAs only differentially expressed in response to acute and/or sustained DOX treatments also suggest the existence of unique molecular signatures in anthracycline-related myocardial damage ( Figure 1b ). We believe that the rapid alteration of these miRNAs within hours of exposure to DOX and maintained over time could be of translational relevance, both as diagnostic biomarker and as therapeutic strategy.\nIn particular, we describe here the myocardial downregulation of several miR-30 family members by acute and sustained DOX treatment and validate four essential genes for cardiomyocyte biology as novel miR-30 targets (β1AR, β2AR, Giα-2 and BNIP3L/NIX; Figures 2c and 3 ). These data are consistent with our previous findings in which miRNAs often target multiple members of a shared signaling pathway, as individual target inhibition in vivo is unlikely to be complete. 51 Alterations in several of these genes have previously been linked to HF (i.e., desensitized βARs, chronic β1AR activation and increased Giα-2 expression). 9 , 10 Moreover, the pro-apoptotic target gene BNIP3L/NIX has been linked to cardiomyopathy through mitochondrial cell death. 39 , 52 In concordance with the present data ( Figure 3g ), enhanced β2AR cardiac expression upon DOX treatment in vivo has recently been reported, although the mechanisms involved were not investigated. 53 Moreover, β2AR deletion has been shown to prevent cardiomyopathy. 54\nReduced miR-30 levels have been associated with myocardial matrix remodeling and with angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy. 31 , 55 Low miR-30e expression was also detected in myocardial tissue from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis. 56 However, the specific myocardial expression of miR-30 in the context of exposure to DOX and its downstream mechanisms had not been previously demonstrated. We show that high miR-30 levels are connected to a global decrease in cAMP ( Figure 4a ), likely to be advantageous given the described link between high cAMP/PKA and cardiomyocyte death. 57 The greater accumulation of cAMP triggered by acute DOX treatment than by specific miR-30 inhibition alone raises the hypothesis that DOX may be acting through alternate pathways toward the same detrimental effect. Upon miR-30e overexpression, ARVCM presented decreased contractile responses to isoproterenol stimulation. As βAR and Giα-2 have opposing effects on the same pathway, such attenuated contractile response reveals a phenotype suggesting preferential βAR repression alongside a compensatory inhibition of Giα-2 ( Figures 4a and c , Supplementary Figure 11 ). This negative feedback loop is likely to contribute to the fine-tuning of the system, which is characteristic of miRNAs and allows intensive regulation of complex biological processes. 58 The preferential βAR inhibition observed results in an overall effect simulating β-blocker agents, which are commonly used to treat HF. Furthermore, milder Giα-2 targeting by miR-30 could also tentatively be beneficial, as retention of Gi activity serves to reduce myocyte death. 59\nFor the first time, we show that DOX treatment triggers an early induction of GATA-6 expression. In addition, our data suggest that DOX-induced GATA-6 upregulation represses miR-30 transcription, a model supported by (primary and mature) miR-30 upregulation in response to GATA-6 silencing. In keeping with this, miR-30-dependent target downregulation was observed upon GATA-6 inhibition ( Figure 6 ).\nCardiomyocyte apoptosis, involving cytochrome c and caspase activation, is a crucial event in HF development in general and after DOX injury. 46 , 60 , 61 Importantly, high miR-30 levels are protective against DOX insult while inhibition of miR-30 is sufficient to increase caspase-mediated apoptosis ( Figure 5a ). Consistent with this, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was lower in cardiac cultures overexpressing miR-30e upon DOX administration ( Figure 5b ) and ROS generation inversely correlated with miR-30 levels, further indicating the beneficial effects of miR-30 expression for cardiac cell viability ( Figure 5c ).\nInterestingly, β-blockers have been shown to prevent cancer progression both in patient cohorts 62 , 63 and animal models. 64 , 65 , 66 Moreover, increasing evidence indicates a tumor-suppressor role for miR-30, having been shown to minimize resistance to chemotherapy and to correlate with less invasive tumors. 67 , 68 , 69 , 70 We confirmed this finding in our system by Transwell migration assays performed on the highly metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, which had impaired migration upon miR-30 overexpression ( Supplementary Figure 13 ). In addition, analyses of breast cancer patients’ data freely available at the Gene Expression Omnibus ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ) consistently showed a reduction in miR-30 levels compared with control individuals ( Supplementary Figure 14 ). Similarly, both SurvMicro ( http://bioinformatica.mty.itesm.mx/SurvMicro ) and PROGmiR ( http://www.compbio.iupui.edu/progmir ) prognostic databases indicated high miR-30 expression to be a biomarker of good prognosis in breast cancer ( Supplementary Figure 15 ). These data are encouraging and suggest that controlled administration of miR-30 mimics could deliver a pleiotropic therapeutic effect. Unfortunately, we could not carry out the required experiments to investigate this further due to the restrictions applied on animal experimentation by the UK Home Office.\nIn aggregate, our findings should contribute to unraveling the complex web of mechanisms via which DOX is able to cause cardiac toxicity and dysfunction, as we reveal the targeting of pathways involved in cardiomyocyte function and viability by a miRNA family that is altered by DOX ( Figure 7 ).\nTop of page\nReferences\nWeiss RB.

The resultant ice loss from Pine Island Glacier (PIG) and its neighboring ice streams presently contributes an estimated ∼10% to global sea level rise, motivating efforts to constrain better the rate of future ice retreat. One route toward gaining a better understanding of the processes required to underpin physically based projections is provided by examining assemblages of landforms and sediment exposed over recent decades by the ongoing ungrounding of PIG. Here we present high-resolution bathymetry and sub-bottom-profiler data acquired by autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveys beneath PIGIS in 2009 and 2014, respectively. We identify landforms and sediments associated with grounded ice flow, proglacial and subglacial sediment transport, overprinting of lightly grounded ice-shelf keels, and stepwise grounding line retreat. The location of a submarine ridge (Jenkins Ridge) coincides with a transition from exposed crystalline bedrock to abundant sediment cover potentially linked to a thick sedimentary basin extending upstream of the modern grounding line. The capability of acquiring high-resolution data from AUV platforms enables observations of landforms and understanding of processes on a scale that is not possible in standard offshore geophysical surveys.\n""","0.22109509","""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JF004311/abstract""","[-2.099122,57.165019]"

This study was aimed at determining whether the resultant pattern of species richness with depth is a consequence of local factors in a given region or whether it simply reflects the global pattern of fish species distribution in the oceans. Along the ocean margin of the temperate NE Atlantic Ocean in the Porcupine Seabight and Abyssal Plain region, 48°–53°N, a total of 108 demersal fish species were identified from 187 trawls at depths from 240 to 4865 m. Fitting of species accumulation curves predicted an asymptote of 120, indicating that the fauna is 90% described. Baited cameras detected 22 scavenging species with a predicted asymptote of 24 species. Scavenging species represented a constant 22.7% (SD 3.5%) of the total species richness throughout the depth range studied. Species richness per trawl varied between a maximum of 16 at 1600 m and 4 on the abyssal plain > 4000 m with no significant influence of sea floor slope (a measure of topographic heterogeneity). Total species richness was 48 at 1600 m and 10 on the abyssal plain. There is a clear transition between slope species above 3000 m and abyssal species below. The depth at which peak species richness occurs (1100–2000 m) coincides with the depth of the permanent thermocline, presence of Mediterranean overflow water (MOW), seasonally strong currents, resuspension of particulate matter, high biomass of benthic filter feeders and pelagic biomass impinging on the slope. We suggest that these factors increase habitat and resource heterogeneity, thus supporting a wider range of fish species. The local pattern of species richness was compared with the global distribution of maximum depths of marine fish species from FishBase. Globally all three Classes of fishes, Agnatha, Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes, showed a logarithmic decrease in species with depth, with the deepest observed species in each class occurring at 3003 m, 4156 m and 8370 m, respectively. In contrast, the local distribution of species maximum depths is idiosyncratic with a mean of 16.6 species maxima per 500 m at 1000–3000 m depth followed by three species per 500 m at 3500–4000 m and 11 species per 500 m at 5000 m. It is concluded that global patterns of species richness, as a source of recruitment, exert a weak influence on local patterns of species richness. Rather, global species richness is the sum of numerous regional and local patterns, each determined by characteristic environmental conditions.\nArticles related to the one you are viewing\nCiting Literature\nNumber of times cited: 36\n1\nSusan Gregory, Martin A.

The resultant ice loss from Pine Island Glacier (PIG) and its neighboring ice streams presently contributes an estimated ∼10% to global sea level rise, motivating efforts to constrain better the rate of future ice retreat. One route toward gaining a better understanding of the processes required to underpin physically based projections is provided by examining assemblages of landforms and sediment exposed over recent decades by the ongoing ungrounding of PIG. Here we present high-resolution bathymetry and sub-bottom-profiler data acquired by autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveys beneath PIGIS in 2009 and 2014, respectively. We identify landforms and sediments associated with grounded ice flow, proglacial and subglacial sediment transport, overprinting of lightly grounded ice-shelf keels, and stepwise grounding line retreat. The location of a submarine ridge (Jenkins Ridge) coincides with a transition from exposed crystalline bedrock to abundant sediment cover potentially linked to a thick sedimentary basin extending upstream of the modern grounding line. The capability of acquiring high-resolution data from AUV platforms enables observations of landforms and understanding of processes on a scale that is not possible in standard offshore geophysical surveys.\n""","0.18441415","""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JF004311/abstract?systemMessage=Please+be+advised+that+we+experienced+an+unexpected+issue+that+occurred+on+Saturday+and+Sunday+January+20th+and+21st+that+caused+the+site+to+be+down+for+an+extended+period+of+time+and+affected+the+ability+of+users+to+access+content+on+Wiley+Online+Library.+This+issue+has+now+been+fully+resolved.++We+apologize+for+any+inconvenience+this+may+have+caused+and+are+working+to+ensure+that+we+can+alert+you+immediately+of+any+unplanned+periods+of+downtime+or+disruption+in+the+future.""","[-2.099122,57.165019]"

A key benefit of formation flying is the ability to reconfigure the spacecraft formation to achieve different mission objectives. In this paper, generation of fuel optimal manoeuvres for spacecraft formation reconfiguration is modelled and analysed as a multi-agent optimal control problem. Multi-agent optimal control is quite different from the traditional optimal control for single agent. Specifically, in addition to fuel optimization for a single agent, multi-agent optimal control necessitates consideration of task assignment among agents for terminal targets in the optimization process. In this paper, we develop an efficient hybrid optimization algorithm to address such a problem. The proposed multi-agent optimal control methodology uses calculus of variation, task assignment, and parameter optimization at different stages of the optimization process. This optimization algorithm employs a distributed computational architecture. In addition, the task assignment algorithm, which guarantees the global optimal assignment of agents, is constructed using the celebrated principle of optimality from dynamic programming. A communication protocol is developed to facilitate decentralized decision making among agents. Simulation results are included to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed multi-agent optimal control algorithm for fuel optimal spacecraft formation reconfiguration.

JENNINGS\nDepartment of Electronic Engineering, Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London, Mile End Road, London E1 4NS, UK\nReceived: 18 January 1993\nRevised: 18 August 1993\nSystems composed of multiple interacting problem solvers are becoming increasingly pervasive and have been championed in some quarters as the basis of the next generation of intelligent information systems. If this technology is to fulfill its true potential then it is important that the systems which are developed have a sound theoretical grounding. One aspect of this foundation, namely the model of collaborative problem solving, is examined in this paper. A synergistic review of existing models of cooperation is presented, their weaknesses are highlighted and a new model (called joint responsibility) is introduced. Joint responsibility is then used to specify a novel high-level agent architecture for cooperative problem solving in which the mentalistic notions of belief, desire, intention and joint intention play a central role in guiding an individual’s and the group’s problem solving behaviour. An implementation of this high-level architecture is then discussed and its utility is illustrated for the real-world domain of electricity transportation management.\nKeywords: Distributed artificial intelligence; multi-agent systems; BDI architecture; joint intentions; intentionality; rational problem solvers\nCited by (29):\nAnton A.

The main communication form of present Internet is human-human. The Internet of Things (IoT) can be considered as the future evaluation of the Internet that realizes machine-to-machine (M2M) learning. Thus, IoT provides connectivity for everyone and everything. The IoT embeds some intelligence in Internet-connected objects to communicate, exchange information, take decisions, invoke actions and provide amazing services. This paper addresses the existing development trends, the generic architecture of IoT, its distinguishing features and possible future applications. This paper also forecast the key challenges associated with the development of IoT. The IoT is getting increasing popularity for academia, industry as well as government that has the potential to bring significant personal, professional and economic benefits.\nDocuments\nFuture Internet: The Internet of Things Architecture, Possible Applications and Key Challenges\nRights statement: “© 2012 IEEE.

This study was aimed at determining whether the resultant pattern of species richness with depth is a consequence of local factors in a given region or whether it simply reflects the global pattern of fish species distribution in the oceans. Along the ocean margin of the temperate NE Atlantic Ocean in the Porcupine Seabight and Abyssal Plain region, 48°–53°N, a total of 108 demersal fish species were identified from 187 trawls at depths from 240 to 4865 m. Fitting of species accumulation curves predicted an asymptote of 120, indicating that the fauna is 90% described. Baited cameras detected 22 scavenging species with a predicted asymptote of 24 species. Scavenging species represented a constant 22.7% (SD 3.5%) of the total species richness throughout the depth range studied. Species richness per trawl varied between a maximum of 16 at 1600 m and 4 on the abyssal plain > 4000 m with no significant influence of sea floor slope (a measure of topographic heterogeneity). Total species richness was 48 at 1600 m and 10 on the abyssal plain. There is a clear transition between slope species above 3000 m and abyssal species below. The depth at which peak species richness occurs (1100–2000 m) coincides with the depth of the permanent thermocline, presence of Mediterranean overflow water (MOW), seasonally strong currents, resuspension of particulate matter, high biomass of benthic filter feeders and pelagic biomass impinging on the slope. We suggest that these factors increase habitat and resource heterogeneity, thus supporting a wider range of fish species. The local pattern of species richness was compared with the global distribution of maximum depths of marine fish species from FishBase. Globally all three Classes of fishes, Agnatha, Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes, showed a logarithmic decrease in species with depth, with the deepest observed species in each class occurring at 3003 m, 4156 m and 8370 m, respectively. In contrast, the local distribution of species maximum depths is idiosyncratic with a mean of 16.6 species maxima per 500 m at 1000–3000 m depth followed by three species per 500 m at 3500–4000 m and 11 species per 500 m at 5000 m. It is concluded that global patterns of species richness, as a source of recruitment, exert a weak influence on local patterns of species richness. Rather, global species richness is the sum of numerous regional and local patterns, each determined by characteristic environmental conditions.\nArticles related to the one you are viewing\nCiting Literature\nNumber of times cited: 36\n1\nSusan Gregory, Martin A.

Optimal multiprocesses are solutions to dynamic optimization problems described by families of control systems coupled through the boundary conditions and cost functions. The theory treats in a unified fashion a wide range of nonstandard dynamic optimization problems, and in many cases provides new optimality conditions. These include problems arising in impulse control, robotics, and optimal investment. Even when specialized to the (single process) free time optimal control problem, the theory improves on known necessary conditions. Detailed analysis of a number of applications and special cases appears in a companion paper.\nCopyright © 1989 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics\nPermalink: https://doi.org/10.1137/0327057\nCited by\n(2018) Robust parameter estimation for nonlinear multistage time-delay systems with noisy measurement data.
